  "descriptionNullable": "The dataset consists of Haematoxylin and Eosin stained histology images at 20x objective magnification (~0.5 microns/pixel) from 6 different data sources. For each image, an instance segmentation and a classification mask is provided. Within the dataset, each nucleus is assigned to one of the following categories:\n\n- Epithelial\n- Lymphocyte\n- Plasma \n- Eosinophil\n- Neutrophil\n- Connective tissue\nFor more information on the dataset and the associated categories, we encourage participants to read the [original dataset paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11195).\n\n### Data Format\n\nOur provided patch-level dataset contains 4,981 non-overlapping images of size 256x256 provided in the following format:\n- RGB images\n- Segmentation & classification maps\n- Nuclei counts\nThe RGB images and segmentation/classification maps are each stored as a single NumPy array. The RGB image array has dimensions `4981x256x256x3`, whereas the segmentation & classification map array has dimensions `4981x256x256x2`. Here, the first channel is the instance segmentation map and the second channel is the classification map. For the nuclei counts, we provide a single `csv` file, where each row corresponds to a given patch and the columns determine the counts for each type of nucleus. The row ordering is in line with the order of patches within the numpy files.\n![](https://grand-challenge-public-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/i/2021/11/20/sample.png)\nA given nucleus is considered present in the image if any part of it is within the central 224x224 region within the patch. This ensures that a nucleus is only considered for counting if it lies completely within the original 256x256 image.\n\n### Content\n\nWhat's inside is more than just rows and columns.
