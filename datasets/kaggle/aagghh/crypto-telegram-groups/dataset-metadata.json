More details on Telethon can be found here: https://docs.telethon.dev/en/latest/\n\nThe dataset is in `JSON` format. This particular `JSON` is easy to read and load into a Pandas data frame. Refer to my notebook here: https://www.kaggle.com/aagghh/trends-in-crypto-space-telegram-analysis\n\nThe size of the dataset is **2.8GB**\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains records of approximately 3+ million messages in the official top crypto exchanges Telegram groups from various users. Also, it contains data such as dates, number of views, shares, and many more.\n\n| Telegram Group Name | Link | File Name | Number of messages |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Binance official group | https://t.me/binanceexchange | `group_messages_binance.json` | 650k | \n| Kucoin official group | https://t.me/Kucoin_Exchange | `group_messages_kucoin.json` | 860k | \n| OKEx official group | https://t.me/OKExOfficial_English | `group_messages_okex.json` | 1m | \n| Huobi official group | https://t.me/huobiglobalofficial | `group_messages_huobi.json` | 550k | \n| Bittrex official group | https://t.me/BittrexGlobalEnglish | `group_messages_bittrex.json` | 70k | \n\n### Inspiration\n\nA potential use-case for this data could be a practice in some sentiment analysis in order to predict the popularity/price of some crypto assets\n\nAlso good to try using this dataset along with various time-series price data in an attempt to see if there is a correlation between the price of an asset and how the community sees it (Bitcoin for instance)\n\nSome other EDA can be applied to this dataset. For instance, I am gonna use this data for the crypto space trends analysis (hello GameStop)\n\nPlease refer to my notebook on the trends here: https://www.kaggle.com/aagghh/trends-in-crypto-space-telegram-analysis",
