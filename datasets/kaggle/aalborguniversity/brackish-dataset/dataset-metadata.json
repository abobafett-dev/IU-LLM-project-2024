Approximately 14,000 new annotations have been added. Choose Version 1 if you want the old version of the dataset used in the CVPRW paper.\n\n### Background \nThis is the first publicly available European underwater image dataset with bounding box annotations of fish, crabs, and other marine organisms. It has been recorded in Limfjorden, which is a brackish strait that runs through Aalborg in the northern part of Denmark.\n\n[comment]: &lt;&gt; (<img src=\"https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F3385658%2F8922fac6f7adcdab527c54501d3d6c0d%2Fvlcsnap-2019-06-13-10h27m26s500.png?generation=1561550112813161&alt=media\">)\n\nThe camera setup used for capturing the data consists of three cameras and three LED lights mounted permanently on a concrete pillar of the Limfjords bridge.

Fish are annotated in 6 different coarse categories\n\n- fish\n\n- small_fish\n\n- crab\n\n- shrimp\n\n- jellyfish\n\n- starfish\n\nThe videos are separated into folders based on their predominant labeled occurrence, but does it not mean that only that label is present in the videos.\n\n**NOTICE:** Only the first 200 frames in 2019-03-19_17-07-53to2019-03-19_17-08-34_1.avi and first 100 frames in 2019-03-19_18-01-56to2019-03-19_18-02-13_1.avi are annotated. **All other videos are fully annotated.**\n\nThe data is split into training, validation, and test dataset follwoing a 80/10/10 split. The splits are provided in the txt files (train.txt, valid.txt, test.txt), each containing the filenames of the frames in the split.\n\nScripts are provided in order to convert videos into frames. The frames are extracted using ffmpeg, and the width and height of the frames are halved. Scripts in order to convert from AAU Bounding Box to MS COCO and VIAME CSV to MS COCO and AAU Bounding Box to YOLO, are also provided.\n\nCode and scripts used for analysis of the data can be found at our [bitbucket](https://www.bitbucket.org/aauvap/brackish-dataset).\n\n### Acknowledgements\nPlease cite the following paper if you find the dataset useful:\n\n    @InProceedings{pedersen2019brackish,\n        title={Detection of Marine Animals in a New Underwater Dataset with Varying Visibility},\n        author={Pedersen, Malte and Haurum, Joakim Bruslund and Gade, Rikke and Moeslund, Thomas B. and Madsen, Niels},\n        booktitle = {The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops},\n        month = {June},\n        year = {2019}\n    }",
