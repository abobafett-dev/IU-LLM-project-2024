News data: I crawled historical news headlines from [Reddit WorldNews Channel][1] (/r/worldnews). They are ranked by reddit users' votes, and only the top 25 headlines are considered for a single date.\n(Range: 2008-06-08 to 2016-07-01)\n\n2. Stock data: Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is used to \"prove the concept\".\n(Range: 2008-08-08 to 2016-07-01)\n\nI provided three data files in *.csv* format:\n\n1. **RedditNews.csv**: two columns\nThe first column is the \"date\", and second column is the \"news headlines\".\nAll news are ranked from top to bottom based on how *hot* they are.\nHence, there are 25 lines for each date.\n\n2. **DJIA_table.csv**: \nDownloaded directly from [Yahoo Finance][2]: check out the web page for more info.\n\n3. **Combined_News_DJIA.csv**:\nTo make things easier for my students, I provide this combined dataset with 27 columns.\nThe first column is \"Date\", the second is \"Label\", and the following ones are news headlines ranging from \"Top1\" to \"Top25\".\n\n**=========================================**\n\n*To my students:*\n\n*I made this a binary classification task. Hence, there are only two labels:*\n\n*\"1\" when DJIA Adj Close value rose or stayed as the same;*\n\n*\"0\" when DJIA Adj Close value decreased.*\n\n*For task evaluation, please use data from 2008-08-08 to 2014-12-31 as Training Set, and Test Set is then the following two years data (from 2015-01-02 to 2016-07-01). This is roughly a 80%/20% split.*\n\n*And, of course, use AUC as the evaluation metric.*\n\n**=========================================**\n\n**+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++**\n\n*To all kagglers:*\n\n*Please upvote this dataset if you like this idea for market prediction.*\n\n*If you think you coded an amazing trading algorithm,*\n\n*friendly advice* \n\n*do play safe with your own money :)*\n\n**+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++**\n\nFeel free to contact me if there is any question~ \n\nAnd, remember me when you become a millionaire :P\n\n**Note: If you'd like to cite this dataset in your publications, please use:**\n\n`\nSun, J.
