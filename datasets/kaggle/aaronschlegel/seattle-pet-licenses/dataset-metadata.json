The data is also obtainable from the [Socrata Open Data Access (SODA)](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Seattle-Pet-Licenses/jguv-t9rb) portal in either CSV or JSON formats. It is also made available here (unofficially, I have no official affiliation with the city of Seattle or the Seattle Animal Shelter) to help spread awareness of the dataset and Seattle's Pet Licensing initiative.\n\n## Content\n\n### Seattle Pet Licenses Dataset\n\nThe data set contains information on licenses issued as far back as 2005 to the end of January 2017. \n\n**Dataset Columns:**\n\n* License Issue Date: Floating Timestamp\n  - Date and time of when the pet license was issued.\n* License Number: Integer\n  - Unique ID for each issued license.\n* Animal's Name: String\n  - Name of the licensed pet.\n* Species: String\n  - Species of the licensed pet. Will be either 'Dog,' 'Cat,' or 'Livestock.'\n* Primary Breed: String\n  - Primary breed of the licensed pet.\n* Secondary Breed: String\n  - Secondary breed (if any) of the licensed pet.\n\n### Washington Zip Codes Tax Returns by Income Bracket\n\nAs part of an analysis done to see if there is a relationship between the volume of pet licenses and the affluence of the particular area, the data also includes the [Statistics of Income 2015 dataset](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-2015-zip-code-data-soi) that features the number of tax returns received by the IRS from each Seattle zip code broken out by several income brackets. The uploaded data represents a clean set of data for analysis use.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe Seattle Pet Licenses dataset was compiled by the City of Seattle Department of Finance and Administrative Services through the city of Seattle's Open Data initiative, and all credit goes to the original creators and maintainers of the data, the [Seattle Animal Shelter](http://www.seattle.gov/animalshelter). I am merely trying to make the data available to a broader audience to help spread awareness.\n\nThe [Statistics of Income (SOI) dataset](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-zip-code-data-soi) is owned and maintained by the IRS. The data presented here is a clean representation of the Washington Zip Code SOI 2015 dataset.\n\n## Inspiration\n\nThe dataset shows there were almost no pets licensed from 2005 up until mid-2014 when volume began rising drastically, for reasons as yet unknown (in that I wasn't able to find any sources mentioning any news that would cause such a significant increase). There also appears to be a massive disparity in the number of dogs licensed compared to cats, even though there are approximately 5 million more owned cats in the United States over dogs. Thus, I hope that by making this data more available, users who analyze the data can find insights and recommendations for the Seattle Animal Shelter to increase pet licensing numbers and help show pet owners who haven't licensed their pets why it is essential.\n\n## Extra\n\nAn [analysis of the Seattle Pet Licenses dataset](https://aaronschlegel.me/extract-analyze-seattle-pet-licenses-dataset.html) with Python can also be found on my website.\n\n## About Seattle Pet Licenses\n\nThe [city of Seattle requires pets over eight weeks old be licensed](https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT9AN_CH9.25ANCO_9.25.050ANLIPEGE). There are several benefits to [licensing one's pet](https://www.seattle.gov/animal-shelter/license), including a return ride home if your pet is lost, and easier contact from a veterinarian if your pet is unfortunately injured. If the licensing is performed at the Seattle Animal Shelter on the third Saturday of any given month, a free rabies vaccine is included, as well as other vaccines and a microchip for a small additional fee.",
