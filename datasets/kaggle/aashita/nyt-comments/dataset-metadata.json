The comment section in the articles is very active and it gives a glimpse of readers' take on the matters concerning the articles. \n\n### Content\n\nThe data contains information about the comments made on the articles published in New York Times in Jan-May 2017 and Jan-April 2018. The month-wise data is given in two `csv` files - one each for the articles on which comments were made and for the comments themselves. The `csv` files for comments contain over  ***2 million comments*** in total with ***34 features*** and those for articles contain ***16 features*** about more than ***9,000 articles***.  \n\n### Inspiration\n\nThe data set is rich in information containing comments' texts, that are largely very well written, along with contextual information such as section/topic of the article, as well as features indicating how well the comment was received by the readers such as `editorsSelection` and `recommendations`. This data can serve the purpose of understanding and analyzing the public mood.  \nThe [exploratory kernel here](https://www.kaggle.com/aashita/nyt-comments-eda) can be used for a review of the features of the dataset and the [NB-Logistic model kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/aashita/starter-kernel-for-predicting-nyt-s-pick/log) for predicting NYT's pick can be used as a starter for building models on a range of ideas, some of which are:\n\n1. Predicting the number of upvotes a comment will receive using the feature `recommendations` as the target variable. With enough training set for the model, we can make a guess of how a hypothetical comment on a certain topic will be received by the community of NYT readers' and this can be considered a tool to gauge public opinion. The design of this model will be very similar to the ones used in ranking the reviews based on guessing how many upvotes the reviews will receive.\n2. Predicting whether a comment will be editor's pick using feature `editorsSelection` as the target variable. It gives a clue to what NYT considers worth promoting.\n3. Based on a comment, guessing the topic (using `sectionName` and/or `newDesk` as the target variable) of the article.\n4. Predicting how likely it is for a comment to get replies (using `replyCount` feature as the target variable).\n5. Predicting how likely it is for an article to initiate discussion and get comments and upvotes as well as sentiment analysis of the comments' text.\n6. Predicting the same as above for topics (indicated by the features `sectionName` and/or `newDesk`).\n7. Analyzing behaviors of the top commenters such as which topics they most likely comment and the sentiment analysis of the comments.\n\n### Data collection\n\nThe [python package here](https://github.com/AashitaK/nyt-comments) written to supplant this dataset can be used to retrieve comments from a customized search of the NYT articles concerning a specific topic, for example - Iraq war or ObamaCare - in a given timeline. The [tutorial here](https://github.com/AashitaK/nyt-comments/blob/master/Tutorial.ipynb) gives detailed information about the use of the package with the help of examples.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n* The data was collected with the help of New York Times API to retrieve URL of the articles.\n* The URL used to retrieve comments from a given article in the code in the [package](https://github.com/AashitaK/nyt-comments) written to retrieve the data is taken from the [blog by Neal Caren](http://nealcaren.web.unc.edu/scraping-comments-from-the-new-york-times/).\n\n",
