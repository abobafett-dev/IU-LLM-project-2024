But my team mates chickened out at the last minute and I had to get the job done. DMart wasn't kind to me when I asked for permission to take pictures of their products(they literally laughed as soon as I turned my back towards exit...how mortifying!) so I went to Modern super market(I'm not kidding, that's the name) and captured all these images with my Mi A2 phone with a lens glass that is broken after I dropped it perhaps fifty times or is it hundred?\n\nAnd the cherry on the top is that we didn't even use this dataset for our project.
