  "descriptionNullable": "Urbanisation is a form of social transformation from traditional rural societies to \nmodern, industrial and urban communities. It is long term continuous process. It \nis progressive concentration of population in urban unit. Kingsley Davies has \nexplained urbanisation as process of switch from spread out pattern of human \nsettlements to one of concentration in urban centers.\n                                                            Migration is the key process underlying growth of urbanization.\n\n\n***\nChallenges in urban development---&gt;;\n\nInstitutional challenges \n\nUrban Governance\n74th amendment act has been implemented half-heartedly by the states, which has not fully empowered the Urban local bodies (ULBs). ULBs comprise of municipal corporations, municipalities and nagar panchayats, which are to be supported by state governments to manage the urban development. For this , ULBs need clear delegation of functions, financial resources and autonomy. At present urban governance needs improvement for urban development, which can be done by enhancing technology, administrative and managerial capacity of ULBs.\n\nPlanning\nPlanning is mainly centralized and till now the state planning boards and commissions have not come out with any specific planning strategies an depend on Planning commission for it. This is expected to change in present government, as planning commission has been abolished and now focus is on empowering the states and strengthening the federal structure.\n\nIn fact for big cities the plans have become outdated and do not reflect the concern of urban local dwellers, this needs to be take care by Metropolitan planning committee as per provisions of 74th amendment act. Now the planning needs to be decentralized and participatory to accommodate the needs of the urban dwellers.\n\nAlso there is lack of human resource for undertaking planning on full scale. State planning departments and national planning institutions lack qualified planning professional. Need is to expand the scope of planners from physical to integrated planning- Land use, infrastructure, environmental sustainability, social inclusion, risk reduction, economic productivity and financial diversity.\n\nFinances\nMajor challenge is of revenue generation with the ULBs. This problem can be analyzed form two perspectives. First, the states have not given enough autonomy to ULBs to generate revenues and Second in some case the ULBs have failed to utilize even those tax and fee powers that they have been vested with.\n\nThere are two sources of municipal revenue i.e. municipal own revenue and assigned revenue. Municipal own revenue are generated by municipal own revenue through taxes and fee levied by them. Assigned revenues are those which are assigned to local governments by higher tier of government.\n\nThere is growing trend of declining ratio of own revenue. There is poor collection property taxes. Use of geographical information system to map all the properties in a city can have a huge impact on the assessment rate of properties that are not in tax net.\n\nThere is need to broaden the user charge fee for water supply, sewerage and garbage disposal. Since these are the goods which have a private characteristics and no public spill over, so charging user fee will be feasible and will improve the revenue of ULBs , along with periodic revision. Once the own revenue generating capacity of the cities will improve, they can easily get loans from the banks. At present due to lack of revenue generation capabilities, banks don\u2019t give loan to ULBs for further development. For financing urban projects, Municipal bonds are also famous, which work on the concept of pooled financing.\n\nRegulator\n\nThere is exponential increase in the real estate, encroaching the agricultural lands. Also the rates are very high, which are not affordable and other irregularities are also in practice. For this, we need regulator, which can make level playing field and will be instrumental for affordable housing and checking corrupt practices in Real estate sector.\n\n\n\nInfrastructural challenges\n\nHousing\nHousing provision for the growing urban population will be the biggest challenge before the government. The growing cost of houses comparison to the income of the urban middle class, has made it impossible for majority of lower income groups and are residing in congested accommodation and many of those are devoid of proper ventilation, lighting, water supply, sewage system, etc. For instance in Delhi, the current estimate is of a shortage of 5,00,000 dwelling units the coming decades. The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (UNCHS) introduced the concept of \u201cHousing Poverty\u201d which includes \u201cIndividuals and households who lack safe, secure and healthy shelter, with basic infrastructure such as piped water and adequate provision for sanitation, drainage and the removal of household waste\u201d.\n\nSafe Drinking Water\nThe safe drinking water sources are also found to be contaminated because of water in the cities are inadequate and in the future, the expected population cannot be accommodated without a drastic improvement in the availability of water. The expenses on water treatment and reuse will grow manifold.\n\nSanitation\nThe poor sanitation condition is another gloomy feature in urban areas and particularly in slums and unauthorized colonies of urban areas. The drainage system in many unorganized colonies and slums are either not existing and if existing are in a bad shape and in bits resulting in blockage of waste water. This unsanitary conditions lead to many sanitation related diseases such as diahorrea and malaria. Unsafe garbage disposal is one of the critical problem in urban areas and garbage management always remained a major challenge.\n\nHealth conditions\nThe important indicators of human development are education and health. The health condition of urban poor in some areas are even more adverse compared to rural areas. As many as 20 million children in the developing countries are dying consequent to drinking water. About 6, 00,000 persons are losing their lives on account of indoor air pollution (Jagmohan, 2005).\n\nThe National Family Health Survey, 2006-07 has envisaged that a lot of women and children are suffering from nutritional anaemia and diseases like tuberculosis and asthma are occurring in good number. Providing health care services to the growing urban population is major challenge before the government health care delivery system.\n\nThey have to take the help of private players as public health facilities are poor. In case of migrants, they cannot take the benefit of government policies, so they have to pay very high charges, which keep them in the vicious cycle of poverty. Urban education system also is becoming elite in private institution due to limited seats and high charged fee. The condition of public educational institution is dismal.\n\nUrban public transport\nAs high income individual are buying more private vehicle and use less public transport. Such huge number of vehicles in cities is causing more traffic jam, which in turn decreases the efficiency of public transport. Also the penetration of public transport is less, which make people use private vehicle. Public transport\nis less disabled friendly. There is also lack of infrastructure and poor maintenance of existing public transport infrastructure\n\n \n\n\nOther challenges\n\nEnvironmental concern\nVulnerability to risk posed by the increasing man-made and natural disasters. According to UNDP 70 % of Indian population is at risk to floods and 60% susceptible to earthquakes. The risk are higher in urban areas owing to density and overcrowding. Urban areas are becoming heat islands, ground water is not being recharged and water crisis is persistent. Here making, water harvesting compulsory will be beneficial\n\nUrban Crime\nPrevention of urban crime is another challenge before the government of States having more number of urban areas and particularly metropolitan cities. The mega cities are facing increased criminal activities on account of unchecked migration, illegal settlements and diverse socio-cultural disparities, organized groups, gangsters, professional criminals for wishing a lavish life in metropolis. The cities of Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru have accounted for 16.2 percent, 9.5 percent and 8.1 percent respectively of the total crime reported from 35 mega cities. Prevention of crime in mega cities is a challenge before the city government in India.\n\nPoverty\nRoughly a third of the urban population today lives below the poverty line. There are glaring disparities between haves and have-nots in urban areas. The most demanding of the urban challenges, unquestionably is the challenge posed by poverty; the challenge of reducing exploitation, relieving misery and creating more human condition for urban poor. There is rise in urban inequality, as per UN habitat report, 2010, urban inequality in India rose from 34 to 38 % based on consumption in period of 1995 to 2005.\n\nProvision of Employment\nProviding gainful employment to the growing urban population is a major challenge before the government. It is generally observed that the literate and semi-literate migrants are absorbed with minimal works, carrying lower wage and more hour of work. The Un Habitat Report (2003) has rightly remarked \u201cThe cities have become a dumping ground for surplus population working in unskilled, unprotected and low wage informal service industries and trade\u201d.\n\nThe urban workers are increasingly being pushed into the informal sector and without any adequate activities in the cities were carried on in public places like footpaths, open empty spaces, parks or just in the streets. The plight of rickshaw pullers and street vendor is widely noted and commented upon. As the rural agriculture sectors is shrinking day by day the challenges before the urban sector to\nprovide viable employment to migrating population will be a daunting task in the coming year.\n\n***\nMachine Learning to Nowcast Urbanization in Developing Markets---&gt;;\n\nAs per a report, around 54% of people who live in urban areas may rise to 65-70% by 2050. According to a survey conducted by the United States in 2014, within 64 years, the urban population increased to 3.9 billion from just 746 million. Also, India is growing rapidly towards a more urbanized country as more smart cities have been introduced in recent years, with local towns also developing. \n\nThe most common method used to measure an area\u2019s urban growth is some of the economic variables like population, area, employment, density, facilities, and some combinations of all these variables. These economic variables are the components of surveys done by the government every ten years. The census data collected by using these components lay the foundation of calculating urban growth.\n\n\n                                                          AI and ML are programmed to recognize patterns and carry out predictions, decision making and perform operations with speed and accuracy.\nThe calculation is made using satellite images and data. Machine learning is one such concept that can widely be used in the process of urbanization. The data that is accumulated can easily be improved within a period. There are a variety of methods that can be used to present a clear picture of the urbanization which can take place in a particular location. The data that are produced using these methods are far more accurate and are completely based on the images of satellites. Artificial intelligence is not required to take frequent data as that keeps updating automatically over and over again with time.\n\nMachine Learning Based Algorithms\nSeveral ML algorithms have been tested for their performance on different kinds of datasets for land use classification and simulation of land use planning processes like:\na] Support vector machines (SVMs) is a group of non-parametric ML algorithms. The core operation of SVMs is to construct a separating hyperplane (i.e., a decision boundary) on the basis of the properties of the training samples, specifically their distribution in feature space.\n\nb] Urban Air Mobility (UAM) introduces a new mode of transport \u2014 the air. Aviation is a mode of transportation that connects and transports people between cities. As cities expand through sprawl, it becomes more difficult to ride swiftly through dense populations with infrastructure on the ground becoming increasingly congested. UAM possesses the potential to fundamentally alter the landscape and people to travel in a safe, efficient, and sustainable manner. Helicopters, helipads, and air traffic control (ATC) services comprise the initial ecosystem of UAM.\n\nc]Using machine learning, we can forecast traffic congestion in a given city in real time. This can be used to forecast demand for eVTOLs at various times of the day and in various geographical regions. A machine learning model evaluates various traffic parameters in order to forecast traffic congestion. Over time, the model learns to recognize traffic patterns in a given hour, week, or month by analyzing traffic data. This is extremely useful for forecasting a city\u2019s seasonal demand for eVTOLs. Demand for eVTOLs increases when traffic congestion is severe. \n\nd] Air Traffic Control (ATC): Machine learning can provide critical insights to aid in the decision-making process for air traffic control systems.\n\nRemedial Measures of Urban Problems in India\n\u27a2 Building sustainable and environmentally friendly cities: Governments should pass \nlaws that plan and provide environmentally sound cities and smart growth \ntechniques, considering that people should not reside in unsafe and polluted areas. \nThe objective here is to build sustainable cities that embrace improved \nenvironmental conditions and safe habitats for all urban populations. Governments \nshould also encourage sustainable use of urban resources and support an economy \nbased on sustainable environment such as investment in green infrastructure, \nsustainable industries, recycling and environmental campaigns, pollution \nmanagement, renewable energy, green public transportation, and water \nrecycling and reclamation.\n\u27a2 Provision of essential services: Urban stakeholders must ensure all populations \nwithin the urban areas have access to adequate essential social services namely \neducation, health, sanitation and clean water, technology, electricity, and food. The \nobjective here is to provide and implement employment opportunities and wealth \ncreation activities so that people can earn a living to pay for the maintenance of \nthe services. Subsidies can also be availed by the government to lower the costs of \nbasic healthcare, basic education, energy, education, public transportation, \ncommunication systems and technology.\n\u27a2 Creation of more jobs: To lessen the negative effects of rapid urbanization while at \nthe same time conserving natural ecosystems, private investments should be \nencouraged so as to utilize natural resources and create more job opportunities. \nTourism promotion and the sustainable exploitation of natural resources can create \nmore jobs for the urban populations. Subsidies and grants may as well be provided \nto foreign and private investment in environmentally friendly \ndevelopment projects that encourage job creation.\n\u27a2 Population control: Key stakeholders in urban areas must provide campaigns and \ncounseling for effective medical health clinics and family planning to help reduce \nthe high rates of population growth. Medical health clinics oriented towards family \nMr. Ershad Ali | Department of Geography, Ananda Chandra College, Jalpaiguri-735101, India 35\nplanning options must be made accessible across the entire urban area with the \nobjective of controlling diseases and population growth.\n\n\n***\nCONCLUSION---&gt;\n\nUsing ML and applying man-made techniques the urbanization growth can increase in a positive way creating more scopes in the present and the future.",
