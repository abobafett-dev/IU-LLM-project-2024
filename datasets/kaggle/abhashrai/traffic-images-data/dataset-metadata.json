  "descriptionNullable": "The dataset consists of 5750 image data rows, with each image having a resolution of 296 by 222 pixels. Each row in the dataset has 65713 columns, where the first column represents the labeling feature. The labeling feature is binary, with a value of 1 indicating congestion and a value of 0 representing uncongested conditions.\n\nThe remaining 65712 columns correspond to the pixel-values of the associated image. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, ranging from 0 to 255. The pixel-values represent the lightness or darkness of the pixel, with higher values indicating darker shades.\n\nTo locate a specific pixel in the image, you can decompose the column index using the formula x = i * 222 + j, where i and j are integers ranging from 0 to 295 and 0 to 221, respectively. This will help you determine the position of a particular pixel within the 296 by 222 image matrix.",
