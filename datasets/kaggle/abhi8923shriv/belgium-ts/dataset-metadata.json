It stores each pixel with a number from 0 to 65536, which specifies the color of the pixel. PPM files also store the image height and width, white space data, and the maximum color value.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to my algorithms friends who taught me CNN. \n\n### Inspiration\n\nMy inspiration is to Master data science.",
