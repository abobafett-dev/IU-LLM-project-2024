It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. Breast cancer typically affects women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB) age 50 and older, but it can also affect men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB), as well as younger women. Healthcare providers may treat breast cancer with surgery to remove tumors or treatment to kill cancerous cells. \n\nFeatures are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
