Since CMS provides overall performance data on over 4,000 facilities, I hope this data can help people answer the following questions:\n\n1.  Which hospitals have the best overall performance?  Best performance by measure such as Patient Experience?\n2.  Which states, cities, counties have the most high-performing hospitals?  The lowest performing hospitals?\n3.  How have individual hospitals overall performance changed between 2016 and 2020?  Are certain locations getting better or worse overall?",
