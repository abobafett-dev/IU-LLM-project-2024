  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\nBank Nifty per minute data is really difficult to find online, you might have to buy an API key from Zerodha or other data vendors to get per minute data. Fortunately, I've extracted a lot of data using the API key but due to the size of the data, it is in month-wise format. I Will be collating the data in the yearly format and will upload the same here.\n\n### Content\nThe data have 7 columns:\nSymbol, Y-M-D, Time, Open, High, Low, Close values for every minute.\nWith the help of the historical data, you can make your own indicators, tweak and check which indicators are giving you better trade profits. Basically, you can make your own trading model, and once done, you can buy Zerodha's API key, get live data and make your own trades.\n\nNote: Some months captured the 8th and 9th columns for volume and OI respectively. Make sure to clean and use the data accordingly.\n\n### Inspiration\nThe main inspiration behind me collecting and working on this data is to make a trading model of my own, where I could trigger the trades when my model gives me a signal. I do trade on the Bank Nifty index but after making a perfect model, I'll rather trade with more confidence and informed decisions.\nI'll be uploading more data as soon as possible.\n\nYou can train and validate your model on this data and I'll get you the test data soon.\nTill then happy modeling :)\nLeave comments if you need any help.",
