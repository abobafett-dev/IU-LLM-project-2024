It has been meticulously curated and organized to facilitate the training and evaluation of machine learning models for car body type classification.\n\n## **Dataset Overview:**\n- **Total Number of Classes**: 7 (Convertible, Coupe, Hatchback, Pick-Up, SUV, Sedan, VAN)\n- **Total Number of Images**: Approximately 7,000 images (1,000 images per class)\n- **Dataset Split**: The dataset is divided into three subsets: Training, Testing, and Validation. Each class contains approximately 1,000 images, equally distributed among these subsets.\n- **Image Variability**: Images in this dataset vary in terms of quality, resolution, lighting conditions, and angles, ensuring a robust and diverse set of samples for model training and testing.\n\n## **Citation:**\nIf you use this dataset in your work or publications, please consider citing it to give credit to the dataset creator.",
