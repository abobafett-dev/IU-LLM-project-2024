  "descriptionNullable": "## Introduction\nAmazon catalog consists of billions of products that belong to thousands of browse nodes (each browse node represents a collection of items for sale). Browse nodes are used to help customer navigate through our website and classify products to product type groups. Hence, it is important to predict the node assignment at the time of listing of the product or when the browse node information is absent.\n\nAs part of this hackathon, you will use product metadata to classify products into browse nodes. You will have access to product title, description, bullet points etc. and labels for ~3MM products to train and test your submissions. Note that there is some noise in the data - real world data looks like this!!\n\n##Data Description\n\n##Full Train/Test dataset details:\n\nKey column \u2013 PRODUCT_ID\nInput features \u2013 TITLE, DESCRIPTION, BULLET_POINTS, BRAND\nTarget column \u2013 BROWSE_NODE_ID\nTrain dataset size \u2013 2,903,024\nNumber of classes in Train \u2013 9,919\nOverall Test dataset size \u2013 110,775\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nThis contest uses Accuracy as the evaluation metric to measure submissions quality. Since this is a multiclass classification problem, we are interested in subset accuracy: the set of labels predicted for a sample must exactly match the corresponding set of ground truth labels.\n\n##Submission File\n\nFor each PRODUCT_ID in the test data set, you are required to provide a browse node id prediction. The submission file should be a csv and contain a header followed by pairs of PRODUCT_ID, BROWSE_NODE_ID.\n\nBy Hackerearth",
