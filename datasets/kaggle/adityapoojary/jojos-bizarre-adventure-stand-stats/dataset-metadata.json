I too recently decided to dive into the world of JoJo and boy I don't regret it one bit.\nI decided to create my very first dataset based on this popular ongoing series known as \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\" or \"JoJo no Kimy\u014d na B\u014dken\" or more affectionately known as JoJo.\n\n\n### Content\n\nA **Stand** (\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9 Sutando) is a visual manifestation of life energy.\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\n\nA Stand is an entity psychically generated by its owner, referred to as a Stand User (\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9\u4f7f\u3044 Sutando Tsukai).[1] It generally presents itself as a figure hovering over or near the user and possesses abilities beyond that of an ordinary human, which, depending on the Stand User, can be wielded for good or evil.\n\nStands abilities are divided into the following categories:\n\n1. **Destructive Power (\u7834\u58ca\u529b Hakairyoku):** Measures the Stand's strength and ability to cause destruction (physical injury or collateral environmental damage) in a given period of time.\n\n2. **Speed (\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9 Sup\u012bdo):** Measures the Stand's agility and reflexes as well as performance speed.\n\n3. **Range (\u5c04\u7a0b\u8ddd\u96e2 Shatei Kyori):** Measures a compromise of the Stand's range of manifestation, range of ability influence, and spatial mobility.\n\n4. **Power Persistence (\u6301\u7d9a\u529b Jizoku-ryoku):** Measures the duration of time that the Stand can actively maintain its ability. It can also be used in the sense of the time it takes before a special ability can be activated again, such as Star Platinum: The World's time stop.\n\n5. **Precision (\u7cbe\u5bc6\u52d5\u4f5c\u6027 Seimitsu D\u014dsa-sei):** Measures the Stand's accuracy and range of influence/effect of their abilities to specified targets. Automatic type Stands are generally evaluated with Rank D or under with a few exceptions.\n\n6. **Development Potential (\u6210\u9577\u6027 Seich\u014d-sei):** Measures the Stand's possible functions, utilization of its abilities and powers, and capacity to improve its overall capabilities. It decreases in rank as the user masters their Stand.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F5817479%2Fb2fed9287d098b349e76cec93afcaa39%2Fstatic-assets-upload10784735729222454732.jpg?generation=1601454290870096&alt=media)\n\n\n**Destructive Power**\n\n~~~ None ~~~\n\nWhen a Stand possesses the \"None\" stat, it is completely incapable of dealing any physical damage to a target or other Stand User without the necessary use of its Ability, and/or assistance of another party. This stat can also be used if a Stand has no physical manifestation whatsoever.\n\n~~~ E ~~~\n\nThe E-Stat for Power shows that the Stand is near incapable of utilizing its ability for a direct source of damage. This can also refer to the Stand's physical power having incredibly limited fields of damage, only capable of dealing damage similar to that of a toddler's strength.\n\n~~~ D ~~~\n\nThe D-Stat for Power gives insight that the Stand has a fair possibility of delivering slight physical harm to a target via the use of it's ability. A D-Stat in Power also refers to the strength of the Stand itself being somewhere lower than that of the average human by a considerable margin, but fatality isn't out of the question.\n\n~~~ C ~~~\n\nThe C-Stat for Power shows that the Stand has a fair capability of dealing with physical harm to a target via the use of its ability or own strength. When referring to physical strength, the Stand shows that has strength incredibly similar; if not identical to that of an average human (although this margin can drop slightly above or below while still being considered a C-Stat in Power).\n\n~~~ B ~~~\n\nThe B-Stat for Power gives insight that the Stand has an above-average potential of being fatal when administering physical damage to a target via the use of its ability of natural strength. When referring to physical strength, the Stand is significantly stronger than the average human and is capable of being within the range of breaking through Dry Wall to 2-inch Iron respectably.\n\n~~~ A ~~~\n\nThe A-Stat for Power is the near-perfect Stat for a Stand, showing that it is more than capable of causing fatalities via the use of its ability or own ability or own natural strength. The A-Stat in Power can also show that the Stand has physical abilities that are near flawless, extending from easily breaking apart tough metals to the nigh-infinite; however not quite exactly infinite.\n\n~~~ Infinite ~~~\n\nAn incredibly rare stat that shows a Stand has a near-limitless potential to cause fatality if it's ability is to be utilized properly. The Stand can cleave through the likes of Stands that possess A-Stats for Durability with absolutely no problem, and usually have abilities that surpass a large variety of defensive abilities.\n\n====================\n\n**Speed**\n\n~~~ None ~~~\n\nIf a Stand possesses a \"None\" stat for Speed, then the Stand is quite literally incapable of movement in any sense of the matter without assistance from the User or other forces. This stat can also be used if the Stand has no physical manifestation whatsoever.\n\n~~~ E ~~~\n\nThe E-Stat for Speed shows that the Stand is extremely sluggish with its average movements, rarely ever pushing past 1-5 MPH. This may also include general movements. This can be due to range limitations, User limitations o or just as a natural balance to the Stand's physical strength; or lack thereof.\n\n~~~ D ~~~\n\nThe D-Stat for Speed gives insight that the Stand possesses a below-average speed of use, manifestation, and/or general movement that push the boundaries of about 6-11 MPH. This is below the average speed of a human, and could possibly be due to limitations on the User or Stand.\n\n~~~ C ~~~\n\nThe C-Stat for Speed shows that the Stand is relatively comparable in most of it's general actions to that of a human. Whether this specifies down to attacking speed and/or spacial movement is dependent on the Stand. The speeds are averaged from around 12-28 MPH due to the range of average human speed. This number can be slightly above or below the average, only by around 10-30 MPH depending on the User's physical traits.\n\n~~~ B ~~~\n\nThe B-Stat for Speed gives insight that the Stand is capable of impressive speeds when considering it's attacking speed, manifestation speed or generalized movement. This number is a slightly drastic jump from about 29-65 MPH. This may or may not take into consideration a Stand's physical capability to throw punches or attacks, but more focuses on spacial movement.\n\n~~~ A ~~~\n\nThe A-Stat for Speed is the near-perfect Stat for a Stand to possess when referring to its ability to move around and attack. This number is a very large playing field, from the range of 66 MPH to near the Speed of Light depending on the Stand. Stands with an A-Stat in Speed tend to be fantastic attackers with blinding movements that can only be picked up by Stands that possess an A-Stat in Precision (most of the time).\n\n~~~ Infinite ~~~\n\nAn incredibly rare stat that shows a Stand has the potential to exceed speeds unthinkable (ranging from the Speed of Light to that and beyond). The Stand itself can move; either through extensive build-up, powering up, or on the rare-chance immediately, at an undefined limit of speed.\n\n====================\n\n**Range**\n\n~~~ None ~~~\n\nIf a Stand possesses a \"None\" stat for Range, the Stand is completely incapable of leaving the User's body in mostly any sense (excluding specific abilities and such). In most cases, the Stand does not possess a physical manifestation; such as Suit Stands, Apparel Stands, etc.\n\n~~~ E ~~~\n\nThe E-Stat for Range shows that the Stand has a very limited range of manifesting away from it' user. This does not affect the range of ability, and should usually be specified. This range limit seems to be within only 1-3 Meters away from the User before the Stand begins to severely weaken, and/or de-manifest.\n\n~~~ D ~~~\n\nThe D-Stat for Range gives insight that the Stand is capable of manifesting slightly farther away from the User with less trouble or strain. This range limit seems to be within 4-7 meters away from the User before the Stand begins to severely weaken, and/or de-manifest.\n\n~~~ C ~~~\n\nThe C-Stat for Range shows that the Stand is able to manifest a fair distance away from its User without the need for strain or trouble. This range limit seems to be within 8-15 meters away from the User before the Stand begins to severely weaken, and/or de-manifest.\n\n~~~ B ~~~\n\nThe B-Stat for Range gives insight that the Stand is very much capable of manifesting a distance away from its user without the need of strain or trouble. This range limit seems to be within 16-49 meters away from the User before the Stand begins to severely weaken, and/or de-manifest.\n\n~~~ A ~~~\n\nThe A-Stat for Range is the near perfect stat for a Stand, showing it is capable of leaving the User for an astounding distance without suffering any strain or trouble whatsoever. This range limit seems to be 50 Meters and beyond (although a range of nearly 1000 Miles would be considered the cap before this is considered Infinite).\n\n~~~ Infinite ~~~\n\nAn incredibly rare stat that shows a Stand is capable of leaving any set range limit that any other Stand seems to have. It is capable of leaving the User's side and tracking and pursuing outwards to quite literally an Infinite distance (although this is arguable if this is truly \"Infinite\" as the world is roughly 25,000 miles wide, and only 12,500 miles can be tested).\n\n====================\n\n**Power Persistence**\n\n~~~ None ~~~\n\nIf a Stand possesses a \"None\" stat for Durability/Staying, the Stand has absolutely no manifestation, and/or cannot be physically harmed in any form off the basis that is doesn't actually exist physically. This stat is usually used for Stands that only act as abilities. Specifications are needed for what the ability does in terms of the abilities control on objects, such as creating ice, controlling plants, etc.\n\n~~~ E ~~~\n\nThe E-Stat for Durability/Staying shows that the Stand grants the User a very limited layer of protection. The Stand itself is incredibly fragile without the use of an ability. Consistency in durability can be similar to that of a pane of glass, paper, cloth, etc. Defense is almost never an option. Stands with E-A Power can potentially handle this Durability.\n\n~~~ D ~~~\n\nThe D-Stat for Durability/Staying gives insight that the Stand has a limited layer of protection. The Stand itself is fragile without the use of an ability, and can rarely defend the User better than the User can defend themselves. Consistency in durability can be similar to that of thicker cloth, glass, a 1/4th inch layer of ice, etc. Defense is rarely an option. Stands with D-A Power can potentially handle this Durability.\n\n~~~ C ~~~\n\nThe C-Stat for Durability/Staying shows that the Stand has defensive capabilities nearly identical to a human of average build, and/or it's User's physique. This means it has the protective layer of skin, muscle and tissue, and the most important factor to a human's defense: bones. Defense is an option. This stat can be used for Durability/Staying very slightly above or below the Durability of an average human. Stands with C-A Power can potentially handle this Durability.\n\n~~~ B ~~~\n\nThe B-Stat for Durability/Staying gives insight that the Stand has a fair ability to defend itself, and it's User. It is significantly stronger than a human in the sense that it rivals materials such as Stone, Iron, Compact Wood, and at the most, Steel. Defense is mostly an option. Stands with B-A Power can potentially handle this Durability.\n\n~~~ A ~~~\n\nThe A-Stat for Durability/Staying is the near-perfect stat for a Stand, showing that it is more than capable of taking brutal punishment from the likes of B-A Power Stands (although some A-Power Stands can far surpass some A-Durability Stands. Specification is needed). The defensive capabilities are quite simply from the likes of Steel and beyond. Stands with usually only A-Power can potentially handle this Durability.\n\n~~~ Infinite ~~~\n\nAn incredibly rare stat that shows the Stand has defensive capabilities that are exactly that: Indefinite. It is capable of taking any amount of physical punishment with no signs of ever taking any form of damage or drawback. This stat does not make a Stand immune to surpassing abilities; such as illness, abilities that have much higher priority, etc. Stands with only specific abilities, and/or Infinite-Power can possibly get past this Durability.\n\n====================\n\n**Precision**\n\n~~~ None ~~~\n\nIf a Stand possesses a \"None\" stat for Precision, it most likely does not require aiming or skill for inflicting it's ability and/or physical harm to a target. This None stat can either mean it has no direct means of inflicting any sort of effect or harm to a target or simply requires no Precision to do so.\n\n~~~ E ~~~\n\nThe E-Stat for Precision shows that the Stand has an extremely poor reactionary ability, can intake barely any information, has extremely poor accuracy when performing tasks, or all three. The abilities of the Stand tend to be extremely far below that of an average human.\n\n~~~ D ~~~\n\nThe D-Stat for Precision gives insight that the Stand has poor reactionary abilities, can intake limited amounts of information, has poor accuracy when performing tasks, or all three. The abilities of the Stand tend to be below that of an average human.\n\n~~~ C ~~~\n\nThe C-Stat for Precision shows that the Stand has reactionary abilities, informational and sensory intake, and/or accuracy similar to that of an average human. This means that the Stand is capable of having a visual reaction speed of roughly .30 to .10 seconds. Some attributes of the Stand may or may not be lower or slightly higher than that of an average human, but in most cases, the Stand is nearly parallel to its User.\n\n~~~ B ~~~\n\nThe B-Stat for Precision gives insight that the Stand has exceptional reactionary abilities, is capable of obtaining information and sensory stimulation, and/or possess accuracy greater than a human can. This means the Stand is capable of having a visual reaction speed of roughly .10 to even as far as .05 seconds, capable of keeping up with the speeds of Stands with a B-Stat in Speed without much problem (results however may possibly vary).\n\n~~~ A ~~~\n\nThe A-Stat for Precision is the near-perfect stat the Stand can possess when referring to its ability to react, obtain information, and/or perform accurate tasks. It is capable of reacting far faster than .0001 seconds visually, and may even have the potential of taking in information and performing accurate tasks far beyond that of even advanced machinery. Stands this precise tend to keep up with the movements of most A-Stat Speed Stands (although not all).\n\n~~~ Infinite ~~~\n\nAn incredibly rare stat that shows the Stand is capable of perfectly reacting and accurately performing tasks that it is specifically given; however this does come with specifications. The Stand may be able to react perfectly and accurately, but this does not mean anything unless the Stand is capable of keeping up with its Speed stat. Another factor to keep in mind is that the Infinite Stat does not mean that the Stand itself does not require the precision, but more-so has perfected Precision, and should not be mistaken with the Precision Stat of None.\n\n====================\n\n**Development Potential**\n\n~~~ None ~~~\n\nIf a Stand possesses a \"None\" stat in Development/Learning, it quite literally means that the Stand has reached it's full potential and is incapable of evolving any further than it already has. This is an incredibly difficult stat to obtain naturally, but it is not impossible.\n\n~~~ E ~~~\n\nThe E-Stat for Development/Learning shows that the Stand has learned quite a lot, and/or has not much to learn to begin with. In a sense, this stat shows that the Stand is nearing it's perfected state, and will soon not be able to progress any further. This Stat can also mean the Stand has a very poor range of utilization when considering its ability.\n\n~~~ D ~~~\n\nThe D-Stat for Development/Learning gives insight that the Stand has learned a lot, and/or has begun to near the end of its development process; whether this is where it began with or not. This Stat can also mean that the Stand has a limited range of utilization when considering its ability.\n\n~~~ C ~~~\n\nThe C-Stat for Development/Learning shows that the Stand has learned a fair amount of information since it's beginning, and/or has started at this level. It shows that the Stand has a bit to learn before it can reach it's perfected state. This Stat can also mean that the Stand has a fair range of utilization when considering its ability.\n\n~~~ B ~~~\n\nThe B-Stat for Development/Learning gives insight that the Stand has not learned all that much since it's beginning, and/or has started at this level of having a high potential of growth. It means that the Stand still has plenty to learn, and can develop quite a bit before reaching it's perfected state. This Stat can also mean that the Stand has a vast variety of methods for utilization when considering its ability.\n\n~~~ A ~~~\n\nThe A-Stat for Development/Learning shows that the Stand has a lot to learn, is a brand new Stand, and/or has the potential of evolving an exceptional amount before ever coming close to reaching it's perfected state. This Stat can also mean that the Stand has a plethora of utility uses when considering its ability. An A in Development is usually the Stat that a Stand that is in Act 1 will always have, and shows that it still can progress into a new Act before reaching its halting point.\n\n~~~ Infinite ~~~\n\nAn incredibly rare stat that shows a Stand has quite literally an endless possibility for developing and progressing through new abilities and powers. In a sense, this Stat is the most perfected state a Stand can ever dream to achieve, as the only way to reach it's perfected state is to envelop every possibility in the known Multiverse as a whole; quite literally impossible. This Stat should only be used in Extremely Specific Cases.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWouldnt be able to collect this data without the following websites:\nhttps://jojowiki.com/Stand_Stats\nhttps://aminoapps.com/c/jjbamino/page/item/stand-guide-stats/7egW_qpwFNI3kx4a1K3vrpqevvvZgYEXBQV\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nJust a fun little experiment to hopefully spark a little joy among all the JoJo fans like me! \ud83d\ude04 Please upvote if you found this interesting !!",

Specifications are needed for what the ability does in terms of the abilities control on objects, such as creating ice, controlling plants, etc.\n\n~~~ E ~~~\n\nThe E-Stat for Durability/Staying shows that the Stand grants the User a very limited layer of protection. The Stand itself is incredibly fragile without the use of an ability. Consistency in durability can be similar to that of a pane of glass, paper, cloth, etc. Defense is almost never an option. Stands with E-A Power can potentially handle this Durability.\n\n~~~ D ~~~\n\nThe D-Stat for Durability/Staying gives insight that the Stand has a limited layer of protection. The Stand itself is fragile without the use of an ability, and can rarely defend the User better than the User can defend themselves. Consistency in durability can be similar to that of thicker cloth, glass, a 1/4th inch layer of ice, etc. Defense is rarely an option. Stands with D-A Power can potentially handle this Durability.\n\n~~~ C ~~~\n\nThe C-Stat for Durability/Staying shows that the Stand has defensive capabilities nearly identical to a human of average build, and/or it's User's physique. This means it has the protective layer of skin, muscle and tissue, and the most important factor to a human's defense: bones. Defense is an option. This stat can be used for Durability/Staying very slightly above or below the Durability of an average human. Stands with C-A Power can potentially handle this Durability.\n\n~~~ B ~~~\n\nThe B-Stat for Durability/Staying gives insight that the Stand has a fair ability to defend itself, and it's User. It is significantly stronger than a human in the sense that it rivals materials such as Stone, Iron, Compact Wood, and at the most, Steel. Defense is mostly an option. Stands with B-A Power can potentially handle this Durability.\n\n~~~ A ~~~\n\nThe A-Stat for Durability/Staying is the near-perfect stat for a Stand, showing that it is more than capable of taking brutal punishment from the likes of B-A Power Stands (although some A-Power Stands can far surpass some A-Durability Stands. Specification is needed). The defensive capabilities are quite simply from the likes of Steel and beyond. Stands with usually only A-Power can potentially handle this Durability.\n\n~~~ Infinite ~~~\n\nAn incredibly rare stat that shows the Stand has defensive capabilities that are exactly that: Indefinite. It is capable of taking any amount of physical punishment with no signs of ever taking any form of damage or drawback. This stat does not make a Stand immune to surpassing abilities; such as illness, abilities that have much higher priority, etc. Stands with only specific abilities, and/or Infinite-Power can possibly get past this Durability.\n\n====================\n\n**Precision**\n\n~~~ None ~~~\n\nIf a Stand possesses a \"None\" stat for Precision, it most likely does not require aiming or skill for inflicting it's ability and/or physical harm to a target. This None stat can either mean it has no direct means of inflicting any sort of effect or harm to a target or simply requires no Precision to do so.\n\n~~~ E ~~~\n\nThe E-Stat for Precision shows that the Stand has an extremely poor reactionary ability, can intake barely any information, has extremely poor accuracy when performing tasks, or all three. The abilities of the Stand tend to be extremely far below that of an average human.\n\n~~~ D ~~~\n\nThe D-Stat for Precision gives insight that the Stand has poor reactionary abilities, can intake limited amounts of information, has poor accuracy when performing tasks, or all three. The abilities of the Stand tend to be below that of an average human.\n\n~~~ C ~~~\n\nThe C-Stat for Precision shows that the Stand has reactionary abilities, informational and sensory intake, and/or accuracy similar to that of an average human. This means that the Stand is capable of having a visual reaction speed of roughly .30 to .10 seconds. Some attributes of the Stand may or may not be lower or slightly higher than that of an average human, but in most cases, the Stand is nearly parallel to its User.\n\n~~~ B ~~~\n\nThe B-Stat for Precision gives insight that the Stand has exceptional reactionary abilities, is capable of obtaining information and sensory stimulation, and/or possess accuracy greater than a human can. This means the Stand is capable of having a visual reaction speed of roughly .10 to even as far as .05 seconds, capable of keeping up with the speeds of Stands with a B-Stat in Speed without much problem (results however may possibly vary).\n\n~~~ A ~~~\n\nThe A-Stat for Precision is the near-perfect stat the Stand can possess when referring to its ability to react, obtain information, and/or perform accurate tasks. It is capable of reacting far faster than .0001 seconds visually, and may even have the potential of taking in information and performing accurate tasks far beyond that of even advanced machinery. Stands this precise tend to keep up with the movements of most A-Stat Speed Stands (although not all).\n\n~~~ Infinite ~~~\n\nAn incredibly rare stat that shows the Stand is capable of perfectly reacting and accurately performing tasks that it is specifically given; however this does come with specifications. The Stand may be able to react perfectly and accurately, but this does not mean anything unless the Stand is capable of keeping up with its Speed stat. Another factor to keep in mind is that the Infinite Stat does not mean that the Stand itself does not require the precision, but more-so has perfected Precision, and should not be mistaken with the Precision Stat of None.\n\n====================\n\n**Development Potential**\n\n~~~ None ~~~\n\nIf a Stand possesses a \"None\" stat in Development/Learning, it quite literally means that the Stand has reached it's full potential and is incapable of evolving any further than it already has. This is an incredibly difficult stat to obtain naturally, but it is not impossible.\n\n~~~ E ~~~\n\nThe E-Stat for Development/Learning shows that the Stand has learned quite a lot, and/or has not much to learn to begin with. In a sense, this stat shows that the Stand is nearing it's perfected state, and will soon not be able to progress any further. This Stat can also mean the Stand has a very poor range of utilization when considering its ability.\n\n~~~ D ~~~\n\nThe D-Stat for Development/Learning gives insight that the Stand has learned a lot, and/or has begun to near the end of its development process; whether this is where it began with or not. This Stat can also mean that the Stand has a limited range of utilization when considering its ability.\n\n~~~ C ~~~\n\nThe C-Stat for Development/Learning shows that the Stand has learned a fair amount of information since it's beginning, and/or has started at this level. It shows that the Stand has a bit to learn before it can reach it's perfected state. This Stat can also mean that the Stand has a fair range of utilization when considering its ability.\n\n~~~ B ~~~\n\nThe B-Stat for Development/Learning gives insight that the Stand has not learned all that much since it's beginning, and/or has started at this level of having a high potential of growth. It means that the Stand still has plenty to learn, and can develop quite a bit before reaching it's perfected state. This Stat can also mean that the Stand has a vast variety of methods for utilization when considering its ability.\n\n~~~ A ~~~\n\nThe A-Stat for Development/Learning shows that the Stand has a lot to learn, is a brand new Stand, and/or has the potential of evolving an exceptional amount before ever coming close to reaching it's perfected state. This Stat can also mean that the Stand has a plethora of utility uses when considering its ability. An A in Development is usually the Stat that a Stand that is in Act 1 will always have, and shows that it still can progress into a new Act before reaching its halting point.\n\n~~~ Infinite ~~~\n\nAn incredibly rare stat that shows a Stand has quite literally an endless possibility for developing and progressing through new abilities and powers. In a sense, this Stat is the most perfected state a Stand can ever dream to achieve, as the only way to reach it's perfected state is to envelop every possibility in the known Multiverse as a whole; quite literally impossible. This Stat should only be used in Extremely Specific Cases.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWouldnt be able to collect this data without the following websites:\nhttps://jojowiki.com/Stand_Stats\nhttps://aminoapps.com/c/jjbamino/page/item/stand-guide-stats/7egW_qpwFNI3kx4a1K3vrpqevvvZgYEXBQV\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nJust a fun little experiment to hopefully spark a little joy among all the JoJo fans like me! \ud83d\ude04 Please upvote if you found this interesting !!",
