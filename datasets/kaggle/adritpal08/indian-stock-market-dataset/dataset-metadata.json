Includes information about:\n\n- Active companies listed on BSE, their industry, security ID, and status\n- Stock quotes for each company, including open, high, low, close, volume, and other metrics\n- Stock quote buy and sell data for each company\n- Period trend data for each company for 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months\n- Historical and latest quarter financial statements for each company, including year-on-year results, quarter results, balance sheet, and cash flow\n- Statement analysis for each company based on various indicators and ratios\n- Peers comparisons for each company based on market capitalization, price-to-earnings ratio, dividend yield, and other metrics\n- Corporate news for each company from various sources\n\nThe data was collected using Python libraries such as bsedata and bselib, which allow extracting real-time data from BSE website. The data was then cleaned, formatted, and organized into different CSV files for easy access and analysis.\n\nThe dataset can be used for various types of projects that require getting live quotes or historical data for a given stock or index, or building large data sets for data analysis and machine learning. Some possible applications are:\n\n- Exploratory data analysis and visualization of the Indian stock market trends and patterns\n- Fundamental analysis and valuation of individual companies based on their financial performance and ratios\n- Technical analysis and trading strategies based on price movements and indicators\n- Portfolio optimization and risk management based on diversification and correlation\n- Sentiment analysis and natural language processing of corporate news and their impact on stock prices\n\nThe dataset is updated regularly with new data as it becomes available on BSE website. The dataset is also open-sourced and reproducible using Kaggle Notebooks, a cloud computational environment that enables interactive and collaborative analysis.\n\n\n<p></p><p></p>\n<div>\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/AdritPal08\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/-GitHub-black?style=flat-square&logo=github&colorB=555\" alt=\"GitHub\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adritpal/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-blue?style=flat-square&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white&colorB=0077B5\" alt=\"LinkedIn\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/adritpal08/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/-Kaggle-teal?style=flat-square&logo=kaggle&logoColor=white&link=https://www.kaggle.com/adritpal08/\" alt=\"Kaggle\"></a>\n</div>",
