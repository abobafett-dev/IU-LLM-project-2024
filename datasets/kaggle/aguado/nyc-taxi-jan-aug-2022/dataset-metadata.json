  "descriptionNullable": "## Description\n\nTLC Trip Record Data\nYellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). The trip data was not created by the TLC, and TLC makes no representations as to the accuracy of these data.\n\nFor-Hire Vehicle (\u201cFHV\u201d) trip records include fields capturing the dispatching base license number and the pick-up date, time, and taxi zone location ID (shape file below). These records are generated from the FHV Trip Record submissions made by bases. Note: The TLC publishes base trip record data as submitted by the bases, and we cannot guarantee or confirm their accuracy or completeness. Therefore, this may not represent the total amount of trips dispatched by all TLC-licensed bases. The TLC performs routine reviews of the records and takes enforcement actions when necessary to ensure, to the extent possible, complete and accurate information.\n\n## Proposed tasks\n\n* Identify the routes with the lowest price/km, time/km, and price/time ratios.\n* Visualize the evolution of the average travel time and distance throughout the day.\n* Calculate the probability of traveling from one zone to another in less than X minutes (where X is easily modifiable).\n* Analyze the zones where it is most likely to take a taxi based on the time of day.\n* Determine the best time of day to travel to the airport.\n* Design a model that predicts the travel duration and cost given the hour, origin, and destination zone. Show the relevance of the dataset attributes.\n\n## Features\n\nVendorID: An ID code indicating the taxi vendor, 1 for Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC and 2 for VeriFone Inc.\nlpep_pickup_datetime: The date and time when the taxi ride started.\nlpep_dropoff_datetime: The date and time when the taxi ride ended.\nstore_and_fwd_flag: Indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor, Y=store and forward; N=not a store and forward trip.\nRatecodeID: The rate code for the trip, 1=Standard rate, 2=JFK, 3=Newark, 4=Nassau or Westchester, 5=Negotiated fare, 6=Group ride\nPULocationID: The pickup location ID, corresponding to the taxi zone where the taximeter was engaged.\nDOLocationID: The dropoff location ID, corresponding to the taxi zone where the taximeter was disengaged.\npassenger_count: The number of passengers in the vehicle.\ntrip_distance: The distance of the trip in miles.\nfare_amount: The metered fare for the trip.\nextra: Extra charges.

This field includes the metered fare, extra charges, mta_tax, tip_amount and tolls_amount plus any improvement_surcharge or ehail_fee.\npayment_type: A numeric code indicating the payment method: 1= Credit card, 2= Cash, 3= No charge, 4= Dispute, 5= Unknown, 6= Voided trip.\ntrip_type: A code indicating whether the trip was a street-hail or a dispatch that is automatically assigned based on the metered rate in use but can be overridden by the driver.\ncongestion_surcharge: 2.75 dollars congestion surcharge assessed trips in yellow and green taxis in Manhattan south of 96th St. The surcharge began being levied in 2019.\n\n## License\n\nThe data from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data website is available to the public under the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL).
