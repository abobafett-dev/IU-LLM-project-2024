It provides comprehensive details on stolen vehicles, including their type, make, year, color, theft date, and region. The analysis aims to uncover intriguing insights, such as the most and least common days for theft occurrences, variations in vehicle types targeted across regions, average age of stolen vehicles categorized by type, and identifying regions with the highest and lowest incidences of vehicle thefts. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for crime analysis, geospatial examination, and understanding trends in motor vehicle theft.\n\n\n### locations.csv\n\n|Field|Description|\n| --- | --- |\n|location_id|Unique ID of the region|\n|region|Name of the region|\n|country|Country where the region is located|\n|population|Population of the region|\n|density|Density of the region (population / km2)|\n\n\n### make_details.csv\n\n|Field|Description|\n| --- | --- |\n|make_id|Unique ID of the make|\n|make_name|Name of the make|\n|make_type|Type of make (Standard or Luxury)|\n\n\n### stolen_vehicles.csv\n\n|Field|Description|\n| --- | --- |\n|vehicle_id|Unique ID of a stolen vehicle|\n|vehicle_type|Type of vehicle|\n|make_id|Matches make_id in the make_details table|\n|model_year|Model year of vehicle|\n|vehicle_desc|Description of vehicle|\n|color|Color of vehicle|\n|date_stolen|Date the vehicle was stolen (MM/DD/YY)|\n|location_id|Matches location_id in the locations table|\n\n<br><br>\n\nReference:\n\nNew Zealand Police.
