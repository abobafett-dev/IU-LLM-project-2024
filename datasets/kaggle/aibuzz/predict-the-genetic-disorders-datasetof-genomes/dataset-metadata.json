Several types of commonly-known diseases are related to hereditary gene mutations. Genetic testing aids patients in making important decisions in the prevention, treatment, or early detection of hereditary disorders,\nWith increasing population, studies have shown that there has been an exponential increase in the number of genetic disorders. Low awareness of the importance of genetic testing contributes to the increase in the incidence of hereditary disorders. Many children succumb to these disorders and it is extremely important that genetic testing be done during pregnancy.\n\nTask\nYou are given a dataset that contains medical information of children who have genetic disorders. Predict the following\nGenetic disorder\nDisorder subclass\n\nData description\nThe dataset folder contains the following files:\ntrain.csv\ntest.csv\n\nThe dataset contains the following columns and their description are mentioned in below link:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZYxZBh4mQjaLBGfqzG4y4txPRxzMOZKD?usp=sharing\n",
