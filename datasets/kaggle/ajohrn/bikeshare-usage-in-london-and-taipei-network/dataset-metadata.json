  "descriptionNullable": "## London and Taipei Bike-Sharing -- What and Why\n\nBike-sharing in a city has in recent years become a key part of urban transport of humans. The data is **spatiotemporal**, that is, it varies over space and time. That variation can be explored, described and modelled in many different ways.\n\nThe two cities contained in this data set are **London and Taipei**, both very large cities with very large bike-share systems. There is **variation within the two cities, as well as between** them. In the [associated Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/ajohrn/london-and-taipei-bike-share-data-the-basics) I illustrate a few variations. \n\nAs inspiration, I have also analyzed this data in a few different ways and written about it in blog posts over the years \n- [descriptive analysis of London and its types of stations](https://medium.com/@AJOhrn/data-footprint-of-bike-sharing-in-london-be9e11425248)\n- [forecasting with graph convolutional networks](https://towardsdatascience.com/london-bike-ride-forecasting-with-graph-convolutional-networks-aee044e48131) \n- [deviation from baselines following COVID-19 in London and Taipei](https://towardsdatascience.com/responses-to-covid-19-in-taipei-and-london-as-revealed-by-bike-sharing-5fcb215f2341)). \n\nI have no doubt there is much more that can be done with this type of data. Consider for example:\n\nThe data cover 2017-19 as well as the first half of 2020. That means a major **concept shift** is present (for London) in mid-March 2020 when the response to the COVID-19 pandemic takes place. The response is not uniform across the system, which itself is interesting. This real-world concept shift can serve as an example of how a model that works well can degrade in performance when nature or society shifts. Can a model be trained in 2017-19 and still perform well in 2020? If not, can a diagnostic be designed to discover the deviation quick? And can a detected shift be incorporated into the model from 2017-19, or do we have to start from scratch?\n\nPrevious work has also shown that **weather** is a key driver for variation is usage. That is especially evident for extreme weather events, like typhoons in Taipei or winter rain in London. Could well-resolved weather data, both with respect to time and location, predict usage? Are weather forecasts, and the error in them, predictive of usage variation -- or in other words, do people adjust their use depending on what they believe the weather will be the next day? How do weekday and weekend usage respond to weather? Or as an exercise in inference of hidden variables, can the weather conditions be predicted from bike usage, say like in a hidden Markov Models (HMM)?\n\nThe two bike-share systems uses docks. That means, each rental event starts and ends at a relatively small number of well-defined spatial locations. That in turn means the data naturally exist on a **graph or network**. Graph analysis, network models, including graph convolutional networks (GCNs) can therefore be applied to the data. How useful is the inductive bias of GCN for short-term forecasts, or can a purely temporal model perform as well or better? Which of the many variants of graph convolutions performs the best? \n\nCities, as most geographies, are heterogeneous. The bike-share data in space and time is a composite of behavioural time-series. Commuter hubs, like large train stations in London, support morning and evening transports to and from work. Bike stations near entertainment areas, like the night markets of Taipei, support after-work leisure. Is there any way to **decompose and model the composite economical and behavioural time-series**, especially if we take into account what is known about businesses, residential areas near each station? Are there other emergent properties that relate to the geography and network structure of the cities and their bike-share systems?\n\nThe raw data is collected from the respective cities open data sites.
