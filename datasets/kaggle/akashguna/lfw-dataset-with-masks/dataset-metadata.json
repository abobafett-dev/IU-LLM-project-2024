The dataset contains faces of celebrities from Labeled Faces in the Wild Dataset wrapped with a Face Mask which could be used for novel tasks such as Mask Detection and Masked Face Recognition.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset contains two folders : \n          1. Masked Faces\n          2. Unmasked Faces \nBoth  folders contain images of 400+ celebrities . Masks are applied in two colours blue and black and in three positions low , mid and high which represent the diffferent ways people wear mask. Both folders only contain sub folders of LFW which were picked for Masked Face Recognition.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThe Dataset was created with tools provided by : https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/facial-mask-overlay-with-opencv-dlib-4d948964cc4d\nThe Original LFW dataset : http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/\n",
