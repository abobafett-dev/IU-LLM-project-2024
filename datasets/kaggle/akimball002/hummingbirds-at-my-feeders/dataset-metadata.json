  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset is comprised of 400 training images, 80 test images (20 per species) and 80 validation images (20 per species). There are 3 main folders folders: \n1) \u2018All_images\u2019 contains all of the images from the train/test/valid set so you can feel free to create your own splits. \n2) \u2018video_test\u2019 is a single dataset captured from a 10 seconds worth of images from my game camera. \n3) \u2018hummingbirds\u2019 is the dataset with subfolders: train, test, and valid. Below each of the main folders you will find each species folder  contain the images. All of the images are in 224 x 224 x 3 size and jpg format. \nThese images were all gathered from various hummingbird feeders in the towns of Morrison and Bailey, Colorado. The game camera is a Bushnell Nature View HD with 1080 HD video with audio. The camera is configured to take 10 second ~30 fps clips upon motion activation. The clips are then run through my hummingbird detection program, which can be downloaded from my GitHub page [1]. That program uses OpenCV to loop through the frames, detect contours within each frame of the video, test to see if a hummingbird is in the shot, and capture a portion of the frame if a bird is present. Using this method, I was able to review a few 1000 \u2013 10 second videos and compile a set of hummingbird photos. I classified the birds using the video footage, because individual hummingbird photos are difficult to classify. It is my hope that the computer models may be able to find differentiating factors that are not obvious to me. I manually went through the 800+/- images per bird species that I collected and separated out 140 \u2013 100 train, 20 test, and 20 valid for each species/gender. My methods were to take images from each video clip that where not identical \u2013 wings up, wings down, wings front, wings back, tail up, tail down are different, as is lighting. Each image was manually cropped such that the length or height of the bird is limiting. I then put the images through a pre-processing program that I developed that numbered and sized them for the dataset. Each image for each species is given a 001.jpg, 002.jpg, ect. \nMy ultimate goal is to have a program that will detect hummingbirds in the video feed from my camera and classify them by species. If that is accomplished, I will post a link to video of the output. \n\nAt this time, I would like to thank Bryan and Denise Wood for allowing me to setup my camera at their beautiful mountain home. \n\nReference:\n[1] Kimball, A.
