  "descriptionNullable": "# Description:\nThis dataset comprises 410 annotated images categorized into two classes: immature and mature cataracts. Each image has undergone preprocessing and augmentation to enhance its suitability for machine learning tasks.\n\n# Preprocessing:\nThe images were preprocessed using the following steps:\n\n- Auto-orientation of pixel data, with EXIF-orientation stripping, to ensure consistency in orientation across images.\n- Resizing to 416x416 pixels, facilitating uniformity in image dimensions.\nAugmentation:\n- To increase the diversity of the dataset and improve model robustness, each source image was augmented by introducing salt and pepper noise, affecting 5% of the pixels. This augmentation technique helps in simulating real-world variations and enhancing the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.\n\n# Annotation:\nCataract annotations are provided in folder format, allowing easy access to categorized images for training, validation, and testing purposes.\n\n",
