That is, until now.\n\nThis dataset contains ratings for ten thousand popular books. As to the source, let's say that these ratings were found on the internet. Generally, there are 100 reviews for each book, although some have less - fewer - ratings. Ratings go from one to five.\n\nBoth book IDs and user IDs are contiguous. For books, they are 1-10000, for users, 1-53424. All users have made at least two ratings. Median number of ratings per user is 8.\n\nThere are also books marked to read by the users, book metadata (author, year, etc.) and tags.\n\n## **Contents**\n\n**ratings.csv** contains ratings.\n\n**to_read.csv** provides IDs of the books marked \"to read\" by each user, as user_id,book_id pairs.\n\n**books.csv** has metadata for each book (goodreads IDs, authors, title, average rating, etc.).\n\nThe metadata have been extracted from goodreads XML files, available in the third version of this dataset as **books_xml.tar.gz. **The archive contains 10000 XML files. One of them is available as sample_book.xml. To make the download smaller, these files are absent from the current version. Download version 3 if you want them.\n\n**book_tags.csv** contains tags/shelves/genres assigned by users to books. Tags in this file are represented by their IDs.\n\n**tags.csv** translates tag IDs to names.\n\nSee the notebook for some basic stats of the dataset.\n\n## **goodreads IDs**\n\nEach book may have many editions. goodreads_book_id and best_book_id generally point to the most popular edition of a given book, while goodreads work_id refers to the book in the abstract sense.\n\nYou can use the goodreads book and work IDs to create URLs as follows:\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/2792775",
