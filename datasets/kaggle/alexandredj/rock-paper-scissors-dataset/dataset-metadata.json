In addition to existing datasets, I added my own pictures, especially to cover the hand shown palm-side, like raised naturally in front of the webcam. \n\nDataset specs:\n- Contents: about 2700 pictures of my own, my wife's and my son's hands (10 years old). \n- Coverage: Both sides of the hand as well as side pictures when rotating the hand\n- Background: Photos were taken on a grey uniform background with different lighting conditions\n- Organisation: Pictures are ordered in 3 classes directory: rock, paper and scissors\n- File format: PNGs, 300x300 px\n- Naming convention: [class_id.png]. Example: rock_5.png, paper_258.png\n\nMy git repo of this project includes notebooks to prepare and train the dataset, as well as tools to remove backgrounds. The final project includes the capture tool I developed and used to record these pictures. \nLink: https://github.com/alexdjulin/RockPaperScissorsCNN",
