Here is the [link](https://zindi.africa/competitions/airqo-african-air-quality-prediction-challenge) to the competition. The objective of the competition is to use Sentinel 5P data to predict air quality around Africa for environmental justice.\n\n**Description**\n\nJoin us on Thursday, 4 April at 5PM GMT for a webinar --&gt; https://lu.ma/rsl9lxnf\n\nAir pollution is the world\u2019s largest environmental health risk, contributing to 7 million premature deaths globally each year, and poor people in developing countries are the most heavily affected. Low-cost IoT sensor networks on the ground have the potential to close the climate data gaps in sub-Saharan Africa, but networks are expensive to implement and maintain in African cities.\n\nSatellite-derived PM2.5 estimates based on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and machine learning techniques can be used to estimate pollution levels over large areas to help develop interventions such as vulnerability risk profiles for urban spaces, health preservation and environmental protection for affected populations, as well as community empowerment, and climate change mitigation.\n\nIn this challenge, you are asked to estimate PM2.5 levels from satellite observations based on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) for eight cities in seven African countries - Lagos, Accra, Nairobi, Yaounde, Bujumbura, Kisumu, Kampala, and Gulu - with varying ground monitoring resolutions, using appropriate machine learning algorithms. Ground-based observations in the selected cities will be used to validate the satellite estimates.\n\nThe models you create will be deployed through AirQo\u2019s user-friendly digital platform (http://platform.airqo.net), which empower communities to access crucial air quality information, providing them with the evidence needed to tackle local pollution challenges, improve public health, and achieve environmental justice.\n\nPhoto by Marcin Jozwiak on Unsplash",
