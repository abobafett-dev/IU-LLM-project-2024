  "descriptionNullable": "# Recyclable and Household Waste Classification Dataset\n\nThis dataset contains a comprehensive collection of 15,000 images (each 256x256 pixels) depicting various recyclable materials, general waste, and household items across 30 distinct categories. With 500 images per category and 250 images per subcategory, this dataset provides a rich and diverse resource for research and development in the fields of waste classification and recycling. By offering a large number of high-quality images, this dataset aims to support the creation of robust and accurate waste sorting and categorization systems.\n\n## Dataset Structure\nThe dataset is organized into a hierarchical folder structure to ensure easy navigation and accessibility. The main folder, named \"images,\" contains subfolders representing specific waste categories or items. **These subfolder names serve as the labels for their respective categories,** making it convenient for researchers and developers to identify and utilize the images for their specific needs. \n\n**You have to split up the dataset into test, train, and validation manually.** See [Recyclable and Household Waste Classification Code](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alistairking/recyclable-and-household-waste-classification-code) for an example of how to do that.\n\nWithin each category subfolder, there are two distinct folders:\n1. `default`: This folder contains standard or studio-like images of the waste item. These images provide a clear and controlled representation of the item, which can be useful for initial training and testing of waste classification models. Each \"default\" subfolder contains 250 images.\n2. `real_world`: This folder contains images of the waste item in real-world scenarios or environments. These images capture the item in various contexts, such as in a trash bin, on the ground, or in a cluttered environment. The real-world images are essential for evaluating the performance and robustness of waste classification models in practical settings. Each \"real_world\" subfolder also contains 250 images.\n\nAll images in the dataset are provided in the PNG format, ensuring high quality and compatibility with a wide range of image processing and machine learning libraries.\n\n## Waste Categories\nThe dataset covers a wide range of waste categories and items, including:\n- **Plastic:** This category includes images of plastic water bottles, soda bottles, detergent bottles, shopping bags, trash bags, food containers, disposable cutlery, straws, and cup lids. These items represent a significant portion of the plastic waste generated in households and are crucial for recycling efforts.\n- **Paper and Cardboard:** This category includes images of newspaper, office paper, magazines, cardboard boxes, and cardboard packaging. These items are commonly recycled and play a vital role in reducing deforestation and conserving natural resources.\n- **Glass:** This category includes images of beverage bottles, food jars, and cosmetic containers made of glass. Glass is a highly recyclable material, and proper classification and sorting are essential for effective recycling processes.\n- **Metal:** This category includes images of aluminum soda cans, aluminum food cans, steel food cans, and aerosol cans. Metal waste is valuable for recycling and can be efficiently processed when correctly identified and separated.\n- **Organic Waste:** This category includes images of food waste, such as fruit peels, vegetable scraps, eggshells, coffee grounds, and tea bags. Organic waste can be composted or used for biogas production, reducing the burden on landfills and generating valuable resources.\n- **Textiles:** This category includes images of clothing and shoes. Textile waste is a growing concern, and proper classification can aid in recycling efforts and reduce the environmental impact of the fashion industry.\n\nPlease refer to the individual subfolders within the dataset for specific examples and instances of each waste category.\n\n## Dataset Usage and Applications\nThe Recyclable and Household Waste Classification Dataset offers a wide range of possibilities for researchers, engineers, and environmental enthusiasts. Some potential uses and applications of this dataset include:\n- Developing and training machine learning models for automatic waste sorting and categorization. The dataset's diverse range of images and real-world scenarios enables the creation of robust and accurate classification models that can be deployed in waste management facilities, recycling centers, and smart waste bins.\n- Analyzing the visual characteristics and features of different waste materials. Researchers can use the dataset to study the unique visual properties of various waste items, such as color, shape, texture, and size. This analysis can contribute to the development of more efficient and targeted waste classification algorithms.\n- Comparing the performance of waste classification algorithms on default and real-world images. The dataset allows researchers to evaluate and benchmark the accuracy and robustness of their algorithms in both controlled and realistic settings. This comparison can help identify the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and guide the development of more reliable waste classification systems.\n- Investigating the impact of real-world scenarios on waste recognition accuracy. The dataset's inclusion of real-world images enables researchers to study how factors such as lighting conditions, object occlusion, and background clutter affect the performance of waste classification models. This research can lead to the development of more resilient and adaptable algorithms that can handle the challenges encountered in real-world waste management scenarios.\n\n## Dataset License and Citation\nThe Recyclable and Household Waste Classification Dataset is available for educational, research, and non-commercial purposes. If you use this dataset in your work, please cite it as follows:\n\nAlistair King, www.kaggle.com/datasets/alistairking/recyclable-and-household-waste-classification\n\n## Contact and Support\nIf you have any questions, suggestions, or inquiries regarding the dataset, please feel free to reach out via the Kaggle discussion section. We welcome feedback and contributions from the community to further enhance and expand this valuable resource.\n\nLet's work together towards a cleaner and more sustainable future by advancing the field of waste classification and recycling through research and innovation \ud83e\udd17.",
