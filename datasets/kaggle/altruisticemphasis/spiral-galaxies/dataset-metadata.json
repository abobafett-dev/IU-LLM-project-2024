Pre-processing of the images are necessary to work on with them.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nAll the images in this dataset have been curated from https://hubblesite.org/ . \n\n\nInspiration\n\nI invite all of you to create wonderful notebooks on this data so that the whole community can learn and grow. The notebooks created will also help me to learn more from all of the experiences Kagglers present here. Have fun!!!!!",
