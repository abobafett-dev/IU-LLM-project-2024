It contains 3,000 JPG images, carefully segmented into three classes representing common pets and wildlife: cats, dogs, and snakes.\n\nDataset Contents:\n\ncats/: A set of 1,000 JPG images of cats, showcasing a wide array of breeds, environments, and postures.\ndogs/: A diverse compilation of 1,000 dog images, capturing a multitude of breeds in various activities and settings.\nsnakes/: An assortment of 1,000 images of snakes, depicting numerous species in both natural and controlled habitats.\nImage Details:\n\nResolution: Each image maintains a uniform resolution of 256x256 pixels, providing clarity and consistency for model training.\nFile Format: JPG\nColor Space: RGB\nIntended Applications:\nThis dataset is primed for use in developing and testing AI models specialized in multi-class animal recognition. It offers valuable resources for researchers and hobbyists in fields such as zoology, pet technology, and biodiversity conservation.\n\nAcknowledgments and Licensing:\nThis dataset is a collective effort of various photographers and organizations.
