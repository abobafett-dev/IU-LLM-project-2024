The original dataset will comprised over 40,000 square kilometers of imagery and exhaustive polygon labels of building footprints in the imagery, totaling over 10 million individual annotations. \n\nThis dataset builds upon the original dataset, such that each image is segmented into 64 x 64 chips, in order to make it easier to build a model for. \n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F4101651%2F66851650dbfb7017f1c5717af16cea3c%2Fchips.png?generation=1607947381793575&alt=media)\n\nThe images also compare the changes that between each image of each month, such that an image taken in month 1 is compared with the image take in month 2, 3, ... 24. This is done by taking the cartesian product of the differences between each image. For more information on how this is done check out the following [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/amerii/augmenting-spacenet-7-sample-data-labels). \n\nThe differences between the images are captured in the output mask, and the 2 images being compared are stacked. Which means that our input images have dimensions of 64 x 64 x 6, and our output mask has dimensions 64 x 64 x 1. The reason our input images have 6 dimensions is because as mentioned earlier, they are 2 images stacked together.
