The dataset will comprise over 40,000 square kilometers of imagery and exhaustive polygon labels of building footprints in the imagery, totaling over 10 million individual annotations.  \n\n[![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F4101651%2F00efe465e1ebacee12041d3a1a0f7330%2Flocations.png?generation=1605455025260931&alt=media)](https://avanetten.github.io/SpaceNet7/sn7_aois_public.html)\n\n### Satellite Images\n\n \nImagery consists of RBGA (red, green, blue, alpha) 8-bit electro-optical (EO) monthly mosaics from Planet\u2019s Dove constellation at 4 meter resolution. For each of the Areas Of Interest (AOIs), the data cube extends for roughly two years, though it varies somewhat between AOIs. All images in a data cube are the same shape, though some data cubes have shape 1024 x 1024 pixels, while others have a shape of 1024 x 1023 pixels.  Each image accordingly has an extent of roughly 18 square kilometers.\n\n \nImages are provided in GeoTiff format, and there are two imagery data types:\n\n \n1. **images**  (training only) - Raw imagery, in `EPSG:3857` projection.\n\n2. **images_masked** (training + testing) - Unusable portions of the image (usually due to cloud cover) have been masked out, in `EPSG:3857` projection..\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F4101651%2F3e44366a047d980804c6bee26eaa3ea9%2Fudm-labels.png?generation=1605456767526756&alt=media)\n\n \n### Building Footprint Labels\nFor each monthly mosaic, the SpaceNet labeling team painstakingly outlined the footprint of each building. These GeoJSON vector labels permit tracking of individual building locations (i.e. addresses) over time, hence the moniker: SpaceNet 7 Urban Development Challenge. See Figure 4 for an example of the building footprint labels in one of the training cities.\n\nWhile building masks are useful for visualization (and for training deep learning segmentation algorithms) the precise vector labels of the SpaceNet 7 dataset permit the assignment of a unique identifier (i.e. address) to each building. Matching these building addresses between time steps is a central theme of the SpaceNet 7 challenge. The figure below displays these building address changes.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F4101651%2F88990ba121d3b550820b72caeebdbef6%2Flabels.png?generation=1605457001725966&alt=media)\n\nThe location and shape of known buildings are referred to as \u2018ground truth\u2019 in this document. Building footprint labels are distributed in multiple formats for the training set:\n\n1. **labels** This folder contains the raw building footprint labels, along with unusable data mask (UDM) labels.  UDMs are caused primarily by cloud cover.  Building footprint labels will not overlap with UDM areas. In `EPSG:4326` projection.\n\n2. **UDM_masks** This folder contains the UDM labels rendered as binary masks, in `EPSG:4326` projection.\n\n3. **labels_match** This folder contains building footprints reprojected into the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the imagery (`EPSG:3857` projection).  Each building footprint is assigned a unique identifier (i.e. address) that remains consistent throughout the data cube.  \n\n4. **labels_match_pix** This folder contains building footprints (with identifiers) in pixel coordinates of the image.\n\n5. CSV format. All building footprints of the whole training set are described in a single CSV file. It is possible to work only with this file, you may or may not find additional value in using the other options listed above. This file has the following format:\n\n**filename**,**id**,**geometry**\n\n ```\nglobal_monthly_2020_01_mosaic_L15-1281E-1035N_5125_4049_13,42,\"POLYGON ((1015.1 621.05, 1003.7 628.8, 1001.5 625.7, 1012.9 617.9, 1015.1 621.05))\"\n\n \nglobal_monthly_2018_12_mosaic_L15-0369E-1244N_1479_3214_13,0,POLYGON EMPTY\n\n \nglobal_monthly_2019_08_mosaic_L15-0697E-0874N_2789_4694_13,10,\"POLYGON ((897.11 102.88, 897.11 104.09, 900.29 121.02, 897.11 121.02, 897.11 125.59, 891.85 125.59, 891.85 102.88, 897.11 102.88), (900.29 113.97, 900.29 108.92, 897.11 108.92, 897.11 113.97, 900.29 113.97))\"\n```\n \n***(The sample above contains 4 lines of text, extra line breaks are added only for readability.)***\n\n- **filename** is a string that uniquely identifies the image. See 'Notes on file names' later for details.\n\n- **id** is a unique identifier (i.e. address), an integer assigned to the building footprint that remains consistent throughout the data cube.\n\n- **geometry** specifies the points of the shape that represents the building in Well Known Text format. Only the POLYGON object type of the WKT standard is supported. The special POLYGON EMPTY construct is used for cases when there are no buildings present in the image. The building id is ignored in this case. (See line #3 for an example above.) The coordinate values represent pixels, the origin of the coordinate system is at the top left corner of the image, the first coordinate is the x value (positive is right), the second coordinate is the y value (positive is down). Note that the polygons must be closed: the first and last entries in their point list must be the same.\n\nUsually a building is defined by a single polygon that represents the exterior boundary edge of its shape. This is sometimes not enough, see building #14 in `global_monthly_2018_01_mosaic_L15-0357E-1223N_1429_3296_13` in the training set for an example shape that contains a hole. In such cases two (or more) polygons are needed, the first one always defines the exterior edge, the second (third, fourth, etc.) defines the interior rings (holes). (See line #4 above for an example of the required syntax in this case.) Note that the way of representing holes is different from how the WKT standard specifies them: the standard mandates that the points of a polygon must be enumerated in an anti-clockwise order if the polygon represents a shape with positive area (exterior rings), and in a clockwise order if the polygon represents a shape with negative area (interior rings). However, what appears clockwise in the latitude/longitude based geographic coordinate system appears anti-clockwise in the image space where the y axis points downwards, so in the hope of causing less confusion we chose a simpler approach: the first polygon is always positive, the rest are always negative.\n\n### Notes on file names\n\n-     The format of a filename (as defined above for the footprint definition CSV file) is:\n   `global_monthly_",
