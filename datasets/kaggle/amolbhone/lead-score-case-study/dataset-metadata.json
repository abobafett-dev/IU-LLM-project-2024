  "descriptionNullable": "**Problem Statement**\n\nAn X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the\ncourses land on their website and browse for courses.\nThe company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website,\nthey might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form\nproviding their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads\nthrough past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc.\nThrough this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is\naround 30%.\nNow, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. To make this process more efficient, the\ncompany wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as \u2018Hot Leads\u2019.\nThe company requires you to build a model wherein need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers\nwith higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion\nchance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.\n\n\n**Goals of the Case Study**\n\nThere are quite a few goals for this case study.\n1.\nBuild a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the\ncompany to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a\nlower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.\n2.\nThere are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's\nrequirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc\nfile. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in yo ur final\nPPT where you'll make recommendations.",
