  "subtitleNullable": "A new dataset for wildfire classification and detection using aerial imagery",
  "descriptionNullable": "The FlameVision dataset is a comprehensive aerial image dataset designed specifically for detecting and classifying wildfires. It consists of a total of 8600 high-resolution images, with 5000 images depicting fire and the remaining 3600 images depicting non-fire scenes. The images are provided in PNG format for classification tasks and JPG format for detection tasks. The dataset is organized into two primary folders, one for detection and the other for classification, with further subdivisions into train, validation, and test sets for each folder. To facilitate accurate object detection, the dataset also includes 4500 image annotation files. These annotation files contain manual annotations in XML format, which specify the exact positions of objects and their corresponding labels within the images. The annotations were performed using Roboflow, ensuring high quality and consistency across the dataset. One of the notable features of the FlameVision dataset is its compatibility with various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including EfficientNet, DenseNet, VGG-16, ResNet50, YOLO, and R-CNN. This makes it a versatile and valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of wildfire detection and classification, enabling the development and evaluation of sophisticated ML models.",
