But what about what each and every character in the serie says?  \nWith hundreds of characters and more than 22K sentences, this database aims to help you test your text mining skills.\n\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe content is pretty simple: the databse contains each and every sentence said in the serie together with who has said it, the episode and the season. Besides I have includeded some extra information that might be useful while analyzing, such as the number of episode of the serie and within the season and the date it was broadcasted. \n\nFor the time being the dataset includes episodes from Season 1 to Season 7. As soon as the scripts of Season 8 are transcribbed, I will update and upload the database.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset would not be possible if it wasn't for the folks of [genius.com](https://genius.com/albums/Game-of-thrones/Season-1-scripts) who have transcribbed all the episodes from the serie. \n\n### Inspiration\n\nI dare you to analyze the following: \n- How does the sentiment of the main characters change with time?\n- What are the most used words in each important family?\n- Comparing characters: between Cersei and Daenerys, who says more times the word \"kill\"? And what about the word \"love\"?\n- Is  there a pattern in the last words of those characters who have died compared to those who are still alive?",
