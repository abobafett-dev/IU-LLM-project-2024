In particular, the problem of clickbait in news analysis has gained attention in recent years.

For this reason, I compiled and labelled a number of news headlines in the Indonesian language.\nThe CLICK-ID is a dataset comprised of Indonesian news headlines extracted from 12 Indonesian online news publishers. It is comprised of 15,000 annotated headlines with clickbait and non-clickbait labels.
