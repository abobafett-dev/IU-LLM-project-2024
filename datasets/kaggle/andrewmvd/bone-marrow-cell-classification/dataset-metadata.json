Doctors use these procedures to diagnose and monitor blood and marrow diseases, cancers, as well as fevers of unknown origin. \n\n&gt; The dataset contains a collection of over **170,000** de-identified, expert-annotated cells from the bone marrow smears of 945 patients stained using the May-Gr\u00fcnwald-Giemsa/Pappenheim stain. The diagnosis distribution in the cohort included a variety of hematological diseases reflective of the sample entry of a large laboratory specialized in leukemia diagnostics. Image acquisition was performed using a brightfield microscope with 40x magnification and oil immersion.\n\n&gt; All samples were processed in the Munich Leukemia Laboratory (MLL), scanned using equipment developed at Fraunhofer IIS and post-processed using software developed at Helmholtz Munich.\n\n\n\n\n# How to use this dataset\n&gt; - Create a multi-classification model to predict cell abnormalities;\n- Create a binary-classification model to predict if a cell is normal or not.\n\n\n# Highlighted Notebooks\n&gt; - Your kernel can be featured here!\n- [Related Dataset: Leukemia Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/leukemia-classification)\n- [More datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/datasets)\n\n\n\n# Acknowledgements\nIf you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors.\n&gt; ### Citation\n&gt; Matek, C., Krappe, S., M\u00fcnzenmayer, C., Haferlach, T., & Marr, C.
