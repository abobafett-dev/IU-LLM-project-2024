The dataset consists of 481 visual fields, of which 312 are randomly sampled from more than 20K whole slide images at different magnifications, from multiple data sources.\nIn total the dataset contains **205,343 labeled nuclei**, each with an instance segmentation mask. Models trained on PanNuke can aid in whole slide image tissue type segmentation, and generalise to new tissues.\n\n# More Medical Imaging Datasets\n- [Part 1](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/cancer-inst-segmentation-and-classification)\n- [Part 2](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/cancer-instance-segmentation-and-classification-2)\n- Part 3 (current)\n- [More datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/datasets)\n\n# How to Cite the Authors\nIf you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors:\n\n### Original Publications\n@article{gamper2020pannuke,\n  title={PanNuke Dataset Extension, Insights and Baselines},\n  author={Gamper, Jevgenij and Koohbanani, Navid Alemi and Graham, Simon and Jahanifar, Mostafa and Benet, Ksenija and Khurram, Syed Ali and Azam, Ayesha and Hewitt, Katherine and Rajpoot, Nasir},\n  journal={arXiv preprint [arXiv:2003.10778](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10778)},\n  year={2020}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{gamper2019pannuke,\n  title={Pannuke: An open pan-cancer histology dataset for nuclei instance segmentation and classification},\n  author={Gamper, Jevgenij and Koohbanani, Navid Alemi and Benet, Ksenija and Khuram, Ali and Rajpoot, Nasir},\n  booktitle={European Congress on Digital Pathology},\n  pages={11--19},\n  year={2019},\n  organization={Springer}\n}\n### License\nCC BY NC SA 4.0\n\n### Splash Image\nImage by Otis Brawley released as public domain by National Cancer Institute, available [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Prostate_cancer_(1).jpg).",
