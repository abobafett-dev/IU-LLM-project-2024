The causes and mechanisms of the disease are not fully understood and therefore no therapies or medications are approved to treat the cause of the illness.\n\n&gt; It has been estimated that **836,000 to 2.5 million Americans and 250,000 to 1,250,000 people in the United Kingdom have CFS**. However, there is controversy over many aspects of the disorder. Physicians, researchers, and patient advocates promote different names and diagnostic criteria. Results of studies of proposed causes and treatments are often poor or contradictory.\n\n&gt; Thus far, core symptoms are deemed to be lengthy exacerbations of the illness following ordinary minor physical or mental activity, such as greatly diminished capacity to accomplish tasks that were routine before the illness, sleep disturbances, difficulty sitting and standing upright and cognitive dysfunction. Frequently and variably, other common symptoms occur involving numerous body systems, and chronic pain is common. Diagnosis is based on the person's symptoms because no confirmed diagnostic test is available.\n\n&gt; With that in mind, this dataset contains all available scientific knowledge published on the topic of ME/CFS indexed on Pubmed, with the hopes of providing scientific insight into what is currently known about this poorly understood disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n# How to use this dataset\n&gt; - Cluster scientific literature to uncover relationships and organize knowledge about the disease.\n- Explore authors, keywords and impact metrics;\n\n\n# Highlighted Notebooks\n&gt; - Your kernel can be featured here!\n- Similar Dataset: [Monkeypox Scientific Literature](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/monkeypox-scientific-literature)\n- [More datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/datasets)\n\n\n\n# Acknowledgements\nIf you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors.\n&gt; ### Citation\n&gt; -  Andrew D'addario.
