More than a dozen additional details are being collected about officers in each shooting.\n\n&gt; The Post is documenting only those shootings in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shot and killed a civilian \u2014 the circumstances that most closely parallel the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., which began the protest movement culminating in Black Lives Matter and an increased focus on police accountability nationwide. The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths.\n\n&gt; The FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. In 2015, The Post documented more than two times more fatal shootings by police than had been recorded by the FBI. Last year, the FBI announced plans to overhaul how it tracks fatal police encounters.\n\n\n# How to use this dataset\n&gt; - [Understanding US Police Shootings](https://www.kaggle.com/cwthompson/shootings-understanding-us-police-shootings) by [Curtis Thompson](https://www.kaggle.com/cwthompson)\n- [Dataset Questions and Suggestions](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/police-deadly-force-usage-us/discussion/155321)\n- [More datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/datasets)\n\n# Acknowledgements\nIf you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors.\n\n&gt; ### BibTeX\n@misc{wapo-police-shootings-bot ,\n    author       = {The Washington Post},\n    title        = {data-police-shootings},\n    month    = jan,\n    year        = 2015,\n    publisher    = {Github},\n    url          = {https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings}\n    }\n\n&gt; ### License\nCC BY NC SA 4.0\n\n&gt; ### Splash banner\nImage by pixabay avaiable on [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/pt-br/foto/ao-ar-livre-auto-automovel-borrao-532001/).",
