Limited studies have tried to address the sentiment extraction task in a setting where multiple entities are present in a news headline. In an effort to further research in this area, we make publicly available SEntFiN 1.0, a human-annotated dataset of 10,700+ news headlines with entity-sentiment annotations, of which 2,800+ headlines contain multiple entities, often with conflicting sentiments.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n**Sinha, A., Kedas, S., Kumar, R., & Malo, P.

We propose a framework that enables the extraction of entity-relevant sentiments using a feature-based approach rather than an expression-based approach.
