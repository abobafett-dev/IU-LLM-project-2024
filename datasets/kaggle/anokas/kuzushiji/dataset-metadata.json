We are able to glimpse the world before our time; and see its culture, norms, and values to reflect on our own. Japan has very unique historical pathway. Historically, Japan and its culture was relatively isolated from the West, until the Meiji restoration in 1868 where Japanese leaders reformed its education system to modernize its culture. This caused drastic changes in the Japanese language, writing and printing systems. Due to the modernization of Japanese language in this era, cursive Kuzushiji (\u304f\u305a\u3057\u5b57) script is no longer taught in the official school curriculum. Even though Kuzushiji had been used for over 1000 years, most Japanese natives today cannot read books written or published over 150 years ago.\n\nThe result is that there are hundreds of thousands of Kuzushiji texts that have been digitised but have never been transcribed, and can only currently be read by a few experts. We've built Kuzushiji-MNIST and sister datasets by taking handwritten characters from these texts and preprocessing them in a format similar to the MNIST dataset, to create easy to use benchmark datasets that are more modern and difficult to classify than the original MNIST dataset.\n\nBy releasing these datasets, we're also hoping to bring together the fields of Japanese literature and ML \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\ud83d\udcda [Read the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01718) to learn more about Kuzushiji, the datasets and our motivations for making them!\n\n## The datasets ##\n\n 1. **Kuzushiji-MNIST** is a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale, 70,000 images), provided in the original MNIST format as well as a NumPy format.
