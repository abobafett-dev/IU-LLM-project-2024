Each survey measures and attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. \n\nThe raw data was processed using Python, SQL and Excel for cleaning and manipulation.\n\nSteps involved in cleaning were\n- Similar questions were group together\n- Values for answers were made consistent (ie 1 == 1.0)\n- Fixing spelling errors\n\n\n## Content\n\nThe SQLite database contains 3 tables. Survey, Question, and Answer.\n\nSurvey (PRIMARY KEY INT SurveyID, TEXT Description)\nQuestion (PRIMARY KEY QuestionID, TEXT QuestionText)\nAnswer (PRIMARY/FOREIGN KEY SurveyID, PRIMARY KEY UserID, PRIMARY/FOREIGN KEY QuestionID, TEXT AnswerText)\n\nSuveyID are simply survey year ie 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019.\nThe same question can be used for multiple surveys\nAnswer table is a composite table with multiple primary keys. SurveyID and QuestionID are FOREIGN KEYS.\nSome questions can contain multiple answers, thus the same user can appear more than once for that questionid.\n\n### Common SQL queries\n\n#### query text information for Questionid\nSELECT * FROM Question where QuestionID = 13;\n\n#### query all answers for specified Questionid\nSELECT AnswerText FROM Answer where QuestionID = 13;\n\n#### query distribution of answer given questionid\nSELECT AnswerText, COUNT(AnswerText) from Answer where QuestionID = 13 group by AnswerText;\n\n#### query distribution of answer given questionid and survey year\nSELECT AnswerText, COUNT(AnswerText) from Answer where QuestionID = 1 and surveyid = 2016 group by AnswerText;\n\n#### query number of participants for each survey\nSELECT surveyid, COUNT(DISTINCT(userid)) FROM answer GROUP BY surveyid;\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe original data set can be found Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI) and can be downloaded and viewed [here](https://osmihelp.org/research).\nThis project was inspired [here](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey).",
