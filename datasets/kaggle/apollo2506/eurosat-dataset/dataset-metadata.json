The end goal for the classification is that the top 2 uses of land in an image are given as output to the user.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains images belonging to the EuroSat dataset. There are 2 folders, namely,\n- EuroSAT \u2192 Contains RGB images collected from the Sentinel Dataset.\n- EuroSATallBands \u2192 Contains *.tif* files which have all the bands of the spectrum as collected from the Sentinel-2 satellite.\n\nEach image is 64x64 pixels with a Ground Sampling Distance of 10m. They were all collected from the [Sentinel-2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) satellite\n\nThe 2 directories containing the following class folders :\n1. AnnualCrop\n2.
