The folder names are the class names. \n\nThe *train.csv* and *validation.csv* contain the extracted features of all images present in the training and validation datasets after passing them through a MobileNet CNN without the fully connected layers.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nAll the data was downloaded from Flickr using their Flickr API. The script for downloading the images can be found at [Download Images Script](https://gitlab.com/GotamDahiya/helper-scripts/-/blob/master/download_images_flickr.py)\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThis dataset is being made for an Image search engine, which can allow users to search highly specialised datasets. All the images are first passed through a CNN, then en encoder, clustered using a clustering algorithm and finally images present in the cluster are compared with the query image using Siamese networks.
