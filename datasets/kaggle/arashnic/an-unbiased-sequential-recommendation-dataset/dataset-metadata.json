Can be downloaded by :\nwget https://zenodo.org/records/10439422/files/KuaiRand-27K.tar.gz command\n\n**2.** **KuaiRand-1K (829MB logs + 3.5GB features)**: randomly sample 1,000 users from KuaiRand-27K, then remove all irrelevant videos. There are 4 million videos rest.Can be downloaded by :\nwget https://zenodo.org/records/10439422/files/KuaiRand-1K.tar.gz   command\n\n**3.**  **KuaiRand-Pure (184MB logs + 10MB features)**: only keeps the logs for the 7583 videos in the candidate pool.\n(Uploaded in this page data) \n\nThere are three log files in each version e.g in KuaiRand-Pure:\n\n**-** log_random_4_22_to_5_08.csv contains all interactions resulting from random intervention.\n\n**-** log_standard_4_22_to_5_08.csv contains all interactions of standard recommendation.\n\n**-** log_standard_4_08_to_4_21.csv contains all interactions of standard recommendation for the same users in the previous two weeks (2022.04.08 ~ 2022.04.21).\n\nComplete files and features description in: https://kuairand.com/ \n\n### **How to Use:**\n\n**1.** **Reasons to use KuaiRand-27K or KuaiRand-1K:**\n**-** Your research needs rigorous sequential logs, such as off-policy evaluation (OPE), Reinforcement learning (RL), or long sequential recommendation.\n\n**2.** **Reasons to use KuaiRand-Pure:**\n**-** The sequential information is not necessary for your research OR If you are OK with the incomplete sequential logs. For example, if you are studying debiasing in collaborative filtering models or multi-task modeling in recommendation.\n**-** If your model can only run with small-size data.\n\n### **Acknowledgment**\nChongming Gao et al, 2022. [KuaiRand: An Unbiased Sequential Recommendation Dataset with Randomly Exposed Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08696)\n\n### **Advantages**\n\nCompared with other datasets with random exposure, KuaiRand has the following advantages:\n\n\u2705 It is the first sequential recommendation dataset with millions of intervened interactions of randomly exposed items inserted in the standard recommendation feeds.\n\n\u2705 It has the most comprehensive side information including explicit user IDs, interaction timestamps, and rich features for users and items.\n\n\u2705 It has 15 policies with each catered for a special recommendation scenario in the Kuaishou App.\n\n\u2705 introduced by 12 feedback signals (e.g., click, like, and view time) for each interaction to describe the user\u2019s comprehensive feedback.\n\n\u2705 Each user has thousands of historical interactions on average.\n\n\u2705 It has three versions to support various research directions in recommendation.\n\n### **Inspiration**\n\nRecommender systems suffer from various biases in the data collection stage . Most existing datasets are very sparse and affected by user-selection bias or exposure bias . It is of critical importance to develop models that can alleviate biases. To evaluate the models, we need reliable unbiased data. KuaiRand is the first dataset that inserts the random items into the normal recommendation feeds with rich side information and all item/user IDs provided. With this authentic unbiased data, we can evaluate and thus improve the recommender policy. \n\nKuaiRand can further support the following promising research directions in recommendation. \n\n**-** *Off-policy Evaluation (OPE)*\n\n**-** *Interactive Recommendation*\n\n**-** *Long Sequential Behavior Modeling*\n\n**-** *Multi-Task Learning*\n\n### **More References**\n**-** *[Bias and Debias in Recommender System: A Survey and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03240.pdf)*\n\n**-** *[A Survey on Popularity Bias in Recommender\nSystems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01118.pdf)*\n\n",
