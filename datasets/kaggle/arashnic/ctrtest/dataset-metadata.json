  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nThe dataset generated by an E-commerce website which sells a variety of products at its online platform. The records user behaviour of its customers and stores it as a log. However, most of the times, users do not buy the products instantly and there is a time gap during which the customer might surf the internet and maybe visit competitor websites.   Now, to improve sales of products, website owner has hired  an Adtech company which built a system such that ads are being shown for owner products on its partner websites.   If a user comes to owner website and searches for a product, and then visits these partner websites or apps, his/her previously viewed items or their similar items are shown on as an ad. If the user clicks this ad, he/she will be redirected to the owner website and might buy the product.  \n\nThe task is to predict the probability i.e. probability of user clicking the ad which is shown to them on the partner websites for the next 7 days on the basis of historical view log data, ad impression data and user data.  \n\n### Content\n\n You are provided with the view log of users (2018/10/15 - 2018/12/11) and the product description collected from the owner website. We also provide the training data and test data containing details for ad impressions at the partner websites(Train + Test).   Train data contains the impression logs during 2018/11/15 \u2013 2018/12/13 along with the label which specifies whether the ad is clicked or not. Your model will be evaluated on the test data which have impression logs during 2018/12/12 \u2013 2018/12/18 without the labels.  You are provided with the following files:\n\n -  train.zip: This contains 3 files and description of each is given below: \n- train.csv \n- view_log.csv \n- item_data.csv\n\n - test.csv: test file contains the impressions for which the participants need to predict the click rate sample_submission.csv: This file contains the format in which you have to submit your predictions.  \n\n\n\n### Inspiration\n- Predict the probability  probability of user clicking the ad which is shown to them on the partner websites for the next 7 days on the basis of historical view log data, ad impression data and user data.  \n\nThe evaluated metric could be  \"area under the ROC curve\" between the predicted probability and the observed target.
