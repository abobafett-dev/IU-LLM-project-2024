The core of the dance recognition problem is to encode low-level information from a raw audio signal and to produce a semantic high-level information. The process of extracting such\nhigh-level information from music is similar to music perception by humans, and can be used for applications as music discovery and recommendation. We benefit from employing the dance music, because a large amount of audio data is publicly available. Various audio recordings of dance music can be extracted either from YouTube or from video recordings of dance competitions, that experience increasing popularity. The categorization of such music data is usually within video or track titles, thus the data can be easily labeled. Moreover, dance recognition is beneficial for beginners or amateur dancers that have difficulties to recognize the dance genre from the music. \n#  \n\n#   \n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/FCLDLt3Ly5Q/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCLDLt3Ly5Q&feature=youtu.be \"Dance Recognition Supplementary Video\")\n*Dance Recognition Supplementary Video*\n\n### Content\n\nwhole data splited to  testing and validation dataset.
