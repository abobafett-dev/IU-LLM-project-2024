Having support from family and friends is important for our happiness and health, and is also instrumental to our ability to share information, learn from others, and seize economic opportunities.\n\nIn this dataset  we can explore data on loneliness and social connections across countries and over time, and review available evidence on how and why social connections and loneliness affect our health and emotional welfare, as well as our material well-being.\n\nDespite the fact that there is a clear link between social connections and well-being, more research is needed to understand causal mechanisms, effect sizes and changes over time.\n\nResearches  show here, oversimplified narratives that compare loneliness with smoking, or that claim we are living a \u2018loneliness epidemic\u2019, are wrong and unhelpful.\n\n### Content\n\nDr. Vivek Murthy, former Surgeon General of the United States, recently wrote: \u201cLoneliness and weak social connections are associated with a reduction in lifespan similar to that caused by smoking 15 cigarettes a day\u201d.\n\nThis \u201815 cigarettes a day\u2019 figure has been reproduced and reported in the news many times, under headlines such as \u201cLoneliness is as lethal as smoking 15 cigarettes per day\u201d.\n\nIt is indeed quite a shocking comparison since around 7 million deaths globally are attributed to smoking every year, and back-of-the-envelope calculations published in medical journals say one cigarette reduces your lifespan by 11 minutes.\n\nHere we can dig deeper to try to understand what the data and research tell us about the link between social relations and health. In a nutshell, the reading of the evidence is as follows:\n\n- There is a huge amount of evidence showing individuals who report feelings of loneliness are more likely to have health problems later in their life.\n- There is credible theory and explanation of biological mechanisms, whereby isolation can set off unconscious surveillance for social threat, producing cognitive biases, reducing sleep and affecting hormones.\n- It\u2019s very likely there is a causal link, but there is no credible experimental evidence that would allow us to have a precise estimate of the magnitude of the causal effect that loneliness has on key metrics of health, such as life expectancy.\n- The fact that we struggle to pin down the magnitude of the effect of loneliness on health doesn\u2019t mean we should dismiss the available evidence. But it does show that more research is needed.\n\n###  Observational studies: A first look at the data\n\nMeasuring loneliness\n\nPsychologists and social neuroscientists often refer to loneliness as painful isolation. The emphasis on painful is there to make a clear distinction between solitude \u2013 the state of being alone \u2013 and subjective loneliness, which is the distressing feeling that comes from unmet expectations of the types of interpersonal relationships we wish to have.\n\nResearchers use several kinds of data to measure solitude and loneliness. The most common source of data are surveys where people are asked about different aspects of their lives, including whether they live alone, how much time they spend with other people in a given window of time (e.g. \u2018last week\u2019) or specific context (e.g. \u2018at social events, clubs or places of worship\u2019); and whether they experience feelings of loneliness (e.g. \u2018I have no-one with whom I can discuss important matters with\u2019). Researchers sometimes study these survey responses separately, but often they also aggregate them in a composite index.\n\nSurveys confirm that people respond differently to questions about subjective loneliness and physical social isolation, which suggests people do understand these as two distinct issues.\n\nThe fact that we see such high levels of loneliness, with substantial divergence across countries, explains why this is an important and active research area. Indeed, there are literally hundreds of papers that have used survey data to explore the link between loneliness, solitude, and health.
