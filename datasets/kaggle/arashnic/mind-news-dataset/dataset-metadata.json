The data randomly sampled 1 million users who had at least 5 news clicks during 6 weeks from October 12 to November 22, 2019. To protect user privacy, each user is de-linked from the production system when securely hashed into an anonymized ID. Also collected the news click behaviors of these users in this period, which are formatted into impression logs. The impression logs have been used in the last week for test, and the logs in the fifth week for training. For samples in training set,  used the click behaviors in the first four weeks to construct the news click history for user modeling. Among the training data,  the samples in the last day of the fifth week used as validation set. This dataset is a small version of MIND (MIND-small), by randomly sampling 50,000 users and their behavior logs. Only training and validation sets are contained in the MIND-small dataset.\n\n&gt;Both the training and validation data are a zip-compressed folder, which contains four different files:\n- behaviors.tsv:\tThe click histories and impression logs of users\n- news.tsv:\tThe information of news articles\n- entity_embedding.vec:\tThe embeddings of entities in news extracted from knowledge graph\n- relation_embedding.vec:\tThe embeddings of relations between entities extracted from knowledge graph\n\n\n#### **behaviors.tsv**\nThe behaviors.tsv file contains the impression logs and users' news click histories. It has 5 columns divided by the tab symbol:\n\n- Impression ID. The ID of an impression.\n- User ID. The anonymous ID of a user.\n- Time. The impression time with format \"MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM/PM\".\n- History. The news click history (ID list of clicked news) of this user before this impression. The clicked news articles are ordered by time.\n- Impressions. List of news displayed in this impression and user's click behaviors on them (1 for click and 0 for non-click). The orders of news in a impressions have been shuffled.\n\n#### **news.tsv**\nThe docs.tsv  contains the detailed information of news articles involved in the behaviors.tsv file. It has 7 columns, which are divided by the tab symbol:\n\n- News ID\n- Category\n- SubCategory\n- Title\n- Abstract\n- URL\n- Title Entities (entities contained in the title of this news)\n- Abstract Entities (entites contained in the abstract of this news)\n\n\n#### **entity_embedding.vec & relation_embedding.vec**\nThe entity_embedding.vec and relation_embedding.vec files contain the 100-dimensional embeddings of the entities and relations learned from the subgraph (from WikiData knowledge graph) by TransE method. In both files, the first column is the ID of entity/relation, and the other columns are the embedding vector values. We hope this data can facilitate the research of knowledge-aware news recommendation.
