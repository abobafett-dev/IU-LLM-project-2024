All images are pre-processed into 28x28 (2D) or 28x28x28 (3D) with the corresponding classification labels, so that no background knowledge is required for users. Covering primary data modalities in biomedical images, MedMNIST is designed to perform classification on lightweight 2D and 3D images with various data scales (from 100 to 100,000) and diverse tasks (binary/multi-class, ordinal regression and multi-label). The resulting dataset, consisting of approximately 708K 2D images and 10K 3D images in total, could support numerous research and educational purposes in biomedical image analysis, computer vision and machine learning.Providers benchmark several baseline methods on MedMNIST, including 2D / 3D neural networks and open-source / commercial AutoML tools.\n\nMedMNIST Landscape :\n\n\n![medmnistlandscape](https://storage.googleapis.com/kagglesdsdata/datasets/4390240/7539891/medmnistlandscape.png?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=databundle-worker-v2%40kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20240202%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20240202T132716Z&X-Goog-Expires=345600&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&X-Goog-Signature=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)\n\nAbout MedMNIST Landscape figure: The horizontal axis denotes the base-10 logarithm of the dataset scale, and the\nvertical axis denotes base-10 logarithm of imaging resolution.

It is as diverse as the VDD and MSD to fairly evaluate the generalizable performance of machine learning algorithms in different settings, but both 2D and 3D biomedical images are provided.\n\n**Standardized**: Each sub-dataset is pre-processed into the same format, which requires no background knowledge for users. As an MNIST-like dataset collection to perform classification tasks on small images, it primarily focuses on the machine learning part rather than the end-to-end system. Furthermore, we provide standard train-validation-test splits for all datasets in MedMNIST, therefore algorithms could be easily compared.\n\n**User-Friendly**: The small size of 28\u00d728 (2D) or 28\u00d728\u00d728 (3D) is lightweight and ideal for evaluating machine learning algorithms. We also offer a larger-size version, MedMNIST+: 64x64 (2D), 128x128 (2D), 224x224 (2D), and 64x64x64 (3D). Serving as a complement to the 28-size MedMNIST, this could be a standardized resource for developing medical foundation models. All these datasets are accessible via the same API.\n\n**Educational**: As an interdisciplinary research area, biomedical image analysis is difficult to hand on for researchers from other communities, as it requires background knowledge from computer vision, machine learning, biomedical imaging, and clinical science.
