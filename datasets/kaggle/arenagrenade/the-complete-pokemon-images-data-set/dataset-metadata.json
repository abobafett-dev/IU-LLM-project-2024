The file name holds the name of the pokemon in the picture.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI solely thank Sanjai Kumaran, for getting me involved with the pokemon matching project in the first place, which down the timeline brings you this dataset.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nGiven some statistics and features of an unknown pokemon, predicting how that pokemon would look like would be a challenging task, once the next versions of this dataset is released.\n\n### Future Work\nWould add a way to easily scrape stats and details about the pokemons. Transforming these features to pokemons would be an interesting problem to explore.",
