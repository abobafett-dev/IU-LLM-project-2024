This dataset help me to achieve what I was looking for.\nThis data can be used for choropleth map, foilage map using Geopandas. There was only state value(lat & long), which I found in existing datasets. So I found this dataset.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis contains all the Major Cities and their respective Latitude and Longitude Values along with the rounded-off population and the exact population\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to Simple Maps for making all this data available in one place, you can find the original dataset here:- https://simplemaps.com/data/in-cities\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nYou can use this dataset for plotting various features about the Major Indian Cities with the help of Geopandas.
