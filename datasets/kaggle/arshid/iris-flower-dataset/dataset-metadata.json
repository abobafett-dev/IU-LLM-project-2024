The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.\n\nThis dataset became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species).\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset is free and is publicly available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository ",
