You can do it with ARIMA, RNN using deep learning and other advanced techniques. In addition, on time data, you can try to override techniques from other areas of machine learning. Cryptocurrencies can be clustered or build portfolio strategies in the long term.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks for yahoo finance for free acces to prices.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI hope my dataset will let you exlore more about data science. I look forward to notebooks and comments from you.",
