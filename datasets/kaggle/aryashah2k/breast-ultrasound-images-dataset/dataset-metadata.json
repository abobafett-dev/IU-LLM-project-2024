The data reviews the medical images of breast cancer using ultrasound scan. Breast Ultrasound Dataset is categorized into three classes: normal, benign, and malignant images. Breast ultrasound images can produce great results in classification, detection, and segmentation of breast cancer when combined with machine learning.\n\nData\nThe data collected at baseline include breast ultrasound images among women in ages between 25 and 75 years old. This data was collected in 2018. The number of patients is 600 female patients. The dataset consists of 780 images with an average image size of 500*500 pixels. The images are in PNG format. The ground truth images are presented with original images. The images are categorized into three classes, which are normal, benign, and malignant.\n\n\nIf you use this dataset, please cite:\nAl-Dhabyani W, Gomaa M, Khaled H, Fahmy A.
