  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset contains product prices from Amazon Canada, with a focus on price prediction. With a good amount of data on what price points sell the most, you can train machine learning models to predict the optimal price for a product based on its features and product name.\n\n&gt; If you find this dataset useful, make sure to show your appreciation by upvoting! \u2764\ufe0f\u2728\n\n## Inspirations\n\nThis dataset is a superset of my [Amazon Canada product price dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/amazon-canada-products-2023-2-1m-products). Another inspiration is this [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mercari-price-suggestion-challenge) that awareded 100K Prize Money\n\n## What To Do?\n\n- Your objective is to create a prediction model that will assist sellers in pricing their products within the optimal price range to generate the most sales.\n- The dataset includes various data points, such as the number of reviews, rating, best seller status, and items sold last month.\n- You can select specific factors (e.g., over 100 reviews = optimal price for the product) and then divide the dataset into products priced optimally vs products priced unoptimally.\n- By utilizing techniques like vectorizing product names and features, you can train a model to provide the optimal price for a product, which sellers or businesses might find valuable.\n\n## How to know if a product sells?\n\n- I would prefer to use the number of reviews as a metric to determine if a product sells. **More reviews = more sales**, right?\n- According to one [source](https://pushpullagency.com/blog/a-deep-dive-into-amazon-consumer-review-statistics/) only 1-2% of buyers leave a review\n- So if we multiply the reviews for a product by 50x, then we would get a good understanding how many units has sold. \n- If we then multiple the product price by number of units sold, we'd get the total revenue generated by the product\n\n## How is this useful?\n\n- Sellers and businesses can leverage your model to determine the optimal price for their products, thereby maximizing sales.\n- Businesses can assess the profitability of a product and plan their supply chain accordingly.",
