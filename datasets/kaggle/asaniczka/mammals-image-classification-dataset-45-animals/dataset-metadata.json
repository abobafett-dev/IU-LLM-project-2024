  "descriptionNullable": "The images are in the ImageNet structure, with each class having its own folder containing the respective images. The images have a resolution of 256x256 pixels.\n\n## Dataset Details:\n\n- Total number of classes: 45\n- Total number of images: 13751\n- Resolution: 256x256 pixels\n- Image format: JPG\n\n&gt; If you find this dataset useful or interesting, please don't forget to show your support by liking it! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc4d\n\n## Data Collection Methodology:\n\nTo create this dataset, \n- I searched for each mammal class on Google Images and extracted the image links. \n- I then downloaded the full-size images from the original source and converted them to JPG format with a resolution of 256 pixels. \n- During the process, most images were downscaled, with only a very few being upscaled. \n- Finally, I manually went over all the images and deleted any that didn't fit well for image classification.\n\n---\n\n## Potential Task Ideas:\n\n1. Train an image classification model using popular architectures like ViT, ResNet, or EfficientNet.\n2. Perform transfer learning on this dataset using pre-trained models.\n3. Explore different data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.\n4. Fine-tune existing models to improve classification accuracy.\n5. Compare the performance of different models on this dataset.\n6. Use the dataset as a benchmark for evaluating new image classification techniques.\n\n---\n\n## Class Naming Convention:\n\nAll files are named in ImageNet style.\n```shell\nKingdom\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 class_1\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 class_1-0001.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 class_1-0002.jpg\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 class_2\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 class_2-0001.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 class_2-0002.jpg\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 class_3\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 class_3-0001.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 class_3-0002.jpg\n\n```\n\nTo obtain the class name from a random filename, you can do `.split('-')[0]`. \n\n**I have not divided the dataset into train,val,test so that you can decide on the split ratios.**",
