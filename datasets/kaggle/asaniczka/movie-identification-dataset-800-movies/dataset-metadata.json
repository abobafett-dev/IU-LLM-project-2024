Create a movie identification system that can predict the title of a movie based on extracted frames.\n2. Train an AI model to identify similar scenes or genres using movie frames.\n3. Develop a content-based recommendation system that suggests movies based on visual similarity.\n4. Explore the correlation between movie ratings and the visual elements captured in the frames. Use [TMDB Full movies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies) for ratings\n5. Train deep learning models like VIT or ResNet using the dataset to develop powerful movie identification systems.\n\n## Specs:\n\n- Each frame has a height of 256px.\n- Width will vary since different movies have different aspect ratios.\n- Roughly 1000 frames were extracted from each movie.\n- All frames for a movie will exist under the folder with the movie's name.\n- Movie names are in the format of `Movie name (Year of release)`.\n- To get more details on movies, use my TMDB movies dataset. Movie names are not a 100% match. Filter by release year and try semantic similarity or vector similarity.\n\n---\n\nPhoto by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jakobowens1?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Jakob Owens</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/clap-board-roadside-jakob-and-ryan-CiUR8zISX60?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a>\n  ",
