This set is designed to provide some insight into sales trends across the state of Connecticut as well as the individual towns within. It is also specifically structured to highlight changes in trends due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Variables\n**list_year**: grand list year of the property (grand list years run from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30).\n**town**: name of the town that the property was sold in.\n**population**: population of the town that the property was sold in.\n**residential_type**: single family, two family, three family, four family, or condo.\n**month**: the month the sale was recorded.\n**year**: the year the sale was recorded.\n**in_pandemic**: boolean value indicating whether the selling date was after March 11, 2020.\n**assessed_value**: tax assessed value of the property at the time of the sale.\n**sale_amount**: final closing sale amount of the property.\n**price_index**: the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for that month/year. Used to normalize dollar values.\n**norm_assessed_value**: CPI-normalized assessed value (assessed_value / price_index * 100).\n**norm_sale_amount**: CPI-normalized sale amount (sale_amount / price_index * 100).\n**norm_sales_ratio**: CPI-normalized assessment to sale ratio (norm_assessed_value / norm_sale_amount).\n**latitude**: latitude for the property's town.\n**longitude**: longitude for the property's town.\n\n*Note: the original dataset also contained the street address and exact sale date for each record. Those variables were removed as they were not relevant to the analysis being conducted and to afford the individuals associated with each sale a stonger degree of personal privacy. Records from October 2000 to October 2010 from the original dataset were omitted due to timeliness issues. Records of non-residential types were omitted as they lacked enough historic records to be of consequence to the analysis.*\n\n### Data sources\nReal estate records: [https://data.ct.gov/Housing-and-Development/Real-Estate-Sales-2001-2020-GL/5mzw-sjtu](https://data.ct.gov/Housing-and-Development/Real-Estate-Sales-2001-2020-GL/5mzw-sjtu)\nTownship shapes: [https://data.ct.gov/Government/Town-Boundary-Index-Map/evyv-fqzg](https://data.ct.gov/Government/Town-Boundary-Index-Map/evyv-fqzg)\nConsumer price index: [https://www.bls.gov/regions/new-england/data/consumerpriceindex_us_table.htm](https://www.bls.gov/regions/new-england/data/consumerpriceindex_us_table.htm)\nTown populations: [https://www.connecticut-demographics.com/cities_by_population](https://www.connecticut-demographics.com/cities_by_population)",
