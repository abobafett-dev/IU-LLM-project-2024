Various studies have shown the effectiveness of machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes Classifier, in distinguishing between fake and true news based on language patterns and content analysis\n\nEfforts have been made to automate the detection of fake news due to the limitations of human ability in consistently identifying fake news. Machine learning and natural language processing techniques have been employed to create tools that can analyze language patterns and classify news articles as real or fake, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in this task\n1\n5\n.
