  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset contains data on all Real Property parcels that have sold since 2013 in Allegheny County, PA.\n\nBefore doing any market analysis on property sales, check the sales validation codes. Many property \"sales\" are not considered a valid representation of the true market value of the property. For example, when multiple lots are together on one deed with one price they are generally coded as invalid (\"H\") because the sale price for each parcel ID number indicates the total price paid for a group of parcels, not just for one parcel. See the Sales Validation Codes Dictionary for a complete explanation of valid and invalid sale codes.\n\nSales Transactions Disclaimer: Sales information is provided from the Allegheny County Department of Administrative Services, Real Estate Division. Content and validation codes are subject to change. Please review the Data Dictionary for details on included fields before each use. Property owners are not required by law to record a deed at the time of sale. Consequently the assessment system may not contain a complete sales history for every property and every sale. You may do a deed search at http://www.alleghenycounty.us/re/index.aspx directly for the most updated information. Note: Ordinance 3478-07 prohibits public access to search assessment records by owner name. It was signed by the Chief Executive in 2007.\n",
