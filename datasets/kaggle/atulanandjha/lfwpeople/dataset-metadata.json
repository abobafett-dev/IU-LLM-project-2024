The data set contains more than **13,000 images** of faces *collected from the web*. Each face has been labeled with the name of the person pictured. **1680** of the people pictured have *two or more distinct photos in the data set*. The only constraint on these faces is that they were detected by the **Viola-Jones face detector**.\n\n![LFW-PEOPLE](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F1746215%2F92752ca2b0bbecdd3fd154b88495558d%2F1_RaupR7k7NrrTJZvop7sH-A.png?generation=1573849119616339&alt=media)\n\n\nThis dataset is a collection of **JPEG pictures** of famous people collected on the internet.

I came up with this as the best kind of dataset for my task. I am posting it here on Kaggle to make it available for other data scientists conveniently and see what magic they can perform with this amazing dataset.",
