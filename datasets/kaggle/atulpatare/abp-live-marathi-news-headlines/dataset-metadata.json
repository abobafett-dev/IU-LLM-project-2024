So the first thought came to mind was to find a dataset on Kaggle and use sklearn functions and walla text classification.\n\nBut that's no fun. I wanted to learn scraping and collecting data and going through the process of pre-processing data, so here's a implementation.\n\nSo I needed a candidate for scraping, also I needed to label the dataset. Also, I wanted to do text processing on my mother tongue 'Marathi'. Finally decided to scrap news headlines, since they each have category, so if I scrap each category, I will have data and labels. Easy, so I implemented the scraper with beautiful soup. After running into multiple issue finished the scraper and it worked.\nIt's not much but it's honest work ;)\n\nAfter scraping and labeling, created a data frame and created a standard csv file.\n\nThen with sklearn I trained a model and got good accuracy, might improve the code later on, but for now I'm satisfied with it. First time text processing on data collected by myself.",
