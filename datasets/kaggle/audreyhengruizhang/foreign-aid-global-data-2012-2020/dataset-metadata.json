Additionally, the log value of GDP and Aid/GDP are added within EDA. <br>\nAll the data are scraped from the *World Bank Database* as well as the *Transparency International Corruption Index* and the *World Happiness Report*. <br>\nThis dataset can be used to test the correlation between different features, such as the relationship between aid and GDP growth. Countries can also be classified by region (e.g. continent) to specify the correlation.",
