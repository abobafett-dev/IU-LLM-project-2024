Privacy concerns were taken into significant consideration in our research study. Focusing on protecting participants\u2019 personal information, we have entirely anonymized each participant\u2019s identity with a random hashed user id.\n\nSensors.csv contains mobile sensor data collected from the accelerometer, gravity, gyroscope, magnetometer, orientation, and GPS sensors.
