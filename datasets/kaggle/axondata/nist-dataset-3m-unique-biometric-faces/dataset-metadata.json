The dataset includes:\n\n- Unique IDs: Each entry has a unique identifier, so there are no duplicate IDs\n- Non-redundant Photos: All photos in the dataset are unique, with no duplicates\n- Correctly Matched Photos and IDs: Photos of different people are correctly matched with their unique IDs\n- Consistent Photos of Individuals: All photos of the same person are grouped under the right ID, so images are not scattered\n\n# How We Ensured the Data is Clean\n\n**1.\tInitial Face Size Check:** We start by checking that each photo meets the minimum face size requirement to ensure they are suitable for facial recognition\n\n**2.\tRemoving Duplicate Photos Within each ID:** We identify and remove any duplicate photos within each folder, making sure all images in a folder are unique\n\n**3.\tValidation of Minimum Number of Faces:** We check that each ID has at least three different photos with faces. This ensures enough data for each ID\n\n**4.\tDuplicate Detection Across the Dataset:** We search for duplicate photos across the whole dataset. This step helps remove redundant images, including photos of celebrities, anime characters, and other irrelevant images\n\n**5.\tRemoving Non-conforming Data:** We remove any data that doesn't meet our criteria, including images that fail the face size check, duplicate IDs and photos, IDs with insufficient photos\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure the dataset you receive is clean, reliable, and ready for use.
