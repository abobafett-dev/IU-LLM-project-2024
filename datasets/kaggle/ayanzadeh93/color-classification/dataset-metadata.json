  "descriptionNullable": "**Introduction**\n\nColor classification is an important application that is used in many areas. For example, systems that perform daily. SVM classifier with an optimal hyperplane life analysis can benefit from this classification process. For the classification process, lots of classification algorithms can be used. Among them, the most popular machine learning algorithms are neural networks, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, Bayes network, support vector machines. In this work for training, SVMs are used and a classifier model was tried to be obtained. SVMs algorithm is one of the supervised learning methods. SVM calls for solutions to regression and classification problems as in all supervised learning methods. This algorithm is usually used to training for separate and classify different labeled samples. As a result of training with SVM, it is aimed to create an optimum hyperplane and classify the data in different\nclasses. This hyperplane is located as far away from the data as possible to avoid error conditions.\n\n**Dataset**\n\nThe datasets have contained about 80 images for trainset datasets for whole color classes and 90 images for the test set. colors which are prepared for this application is y yellow, black, white, green, red, orange, blue a and violet. In this implementation, basic colors are preferred for classification. and created a dataset containing images of these basic colors. The dataset also includes masks for all images. we create these masks by binarizing the image. we did the masking on the images I collected and painted the pixels belonging to the class color to white and remaining pixels to the black color.",
