EEG data is often used to study brain activity and can be analyzed using various signal processing techniques.\n\nLet me break down these domains:\n\n1. **Time Domain:**\n   - Features in the time domain are related to the amplitude and time characteristics of the EEG signal.\n   - Common time domain features include mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and other statistical measures.\n\n2. **Frequency Domain:**\n   - Features in the frequency domain involve analyzing the signal in terms of its frequency components.\n   - Common frequency domain features include power spectral density, dominant frequency, and spectral entropy.\n\n3. **Time-Frequency Domain:**\n   - Time-frequency analysis involves studying how the frequency content of the signal changes over time.\n   - Common techniques include Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Wavelet Transform, and spectrogram analysis.\n   - Features in this domain might include changes in power across different frequency bands over time.\n\nThe combination of features from these domains provides a comprehensive understanding of the EEG signals and can be crucial for tasks such as brain-computer interface development, seizure detection, and cognitive state analysis.\n\n",
