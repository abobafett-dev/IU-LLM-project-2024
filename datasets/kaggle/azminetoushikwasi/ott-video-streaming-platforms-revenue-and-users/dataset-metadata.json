This includes any web or app-based streaming service, like Netflix, YouTube, Disney Plus and many more.\nThere's a wide range of OTT platforms, including Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Peacock, CuriosityStream, Pluto TV, and so many more. Unlike OTT platforms, YouTube is a social video platform that was originally designed to allow everyday consumers to share moments caught on video. YouTube has attempted to enter the OTT market a number of times with limited success, since the market clearly sees YouTube as a place for free content.\n\n# Content\n|    | File                         | File Type |\n| -- | ---------------------------- | --------- |\n| 1  | LibrarySize.csv              | CSV file  |\n| 2  | MinuteSharing.csv            | CSV file  |\n| 3  | AppUsage.csv                 | CSV file  |\n| 4  | NumSubscribers.csv           | CSV file  |\n| 5  | Revenue.csv                  | CSV file  |\n| 6  | Revenue.csv                  | CSV file  |\n| 7  | AdRevenue.csv                | CSV file  |\n| 8  | LiveTVSubscribers.csv        | CSV file  |\n| 9  | NumSubscribers.csv           | CSV file  |\n| 10 | Profit.csv                   | CSV file  |\n| 11 | Revenue.csv                  | CSV file  |\n| 12 | SubscriptionRevenue.csv      | CSV file  |\n| 13 | Valuation.csv                | CSV file  |\n| 14 | ContentSpend.csv             | CSV file  |\n| 15 | NumSubscribers.csv           | CSV file  |\n| 16 | NumSubscribersByRegion.csv   | CSV file  |\n| 17 | Profit.csv                   | CSV file  |\n| 18 | Revenue.csv                  | CSV file  |\n| 19 | RevenueByRegion.csv          | CSV file  |\n| 20 | Revenue.csv                  | CSV file  |\n| 21 | Users.csv                    | CSV file  |\n| 22 | AdRevenue.csv                | CSV file  |\n| 23 | ConcurrentViewers.csv        | CSV file  |\n| 24 | HoursWatched.csv             | CSV file  |\n| 25 | MostViewedGamesOnTwitch.csv  | CSV file  |\n| 26 | Revenue.csv                  | CSV file  |\n| 27 | TwitchAgeDemographics.csv    | CSV file  |\n| 28 | TwitchGenderDemographics.csv | CSV file  |\n| 29 | TwitchStreamers.csv          | CSV file  |\n| 30 | AppUsage.csv                 | CSV file  |\n| 31 | NumSubscribers.csv           | CSV file  |\n| 32 | Revenue.csv                  | CSV file  |\n| 33 | AppUsage.csv                 | CSV file  |\n| 34 | NumSubscribers.csv           | CSV file  |\n| 35 | Revenue.csv                  | CSV file  |\n| 36 | TopPlatforms.csv             | CSV file  |\n| 37 | PremiumSubscribers.csv       | CSV file  |\n| 38 | Revenue.csv                  | CSV file  |\n| 39 | Users.csv                    | CSV file  |\n\n\n\n# Download\n- kaggle API Command\n`!kaggle datasets download -d azminetoushikwasi/ott-video-streaming-platforms-revenue-and-users`\n\n## Disclaimer\n- The data collected are all publicly available and it's intended for educational purposes only.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n- Cover image taken from internet.\n\n## Appreciate, Support, Share",
