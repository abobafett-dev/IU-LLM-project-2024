  "descriptionNullable": "This describes creating an inscription image database for the ancient Marathi inscription image enhancement system. The database was created from inscription images of carved ancient Marathi text. Thus, the database provides the basis for developing practical Marathi inscription enhancement systems. It provides a standard benchmark for comparing different algorithms for Ancient Marathi Inscription Image text and helps in the research and development of ancient inscription image enhancement and recognition systems. The database contains more than 1000 sample inscription images with different scales. It is consisting of more than 10,000 characters from ancient times. Ancient Marathi Inscription Database servers like MNIST are a dataset for handwritten inscription image enhancement and recognition for Marathi carved characters. Augmentation techniques play a pivotal role in enhancing image processing models' performance and generalization capabilities. \nData Collection\nData collection is a significant step in constructing the database. Various methods are used to collect data from different sources:\n1. Utilizing research papers, archaeological books, and relevant materials.\n2. Consulting with archaeological experts.\n3. Conducting field visits and making observations.\nResearch papers, Archaeology related Books and Material:\n Both quantitative and qualitative data are collected from various archaeological books, including \"Kumbhar Anand Sanshodhan Tarang, Navbharat Prakashan, Mumbai\", \"Madhugin Itihaasaachi Sadhne Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal Khand 2\", \"Prachin Marathi Koriv Lekh, Pune Vidyapeeth Prakashan\", \"Punashya Pandharpur Shilalekh Mahathi Sahitya Patrika Ank\", and \"Maharashtra va Goa Shilalekh: Tamrapatachi Varnanatmak Suchi Mumbai.\"\nFrom these books, the following activities are conducted:\n1. Collection of Marathi inscription images.\n2. Compilation of details about Marathi inscriptions.\n3. Retrieval of information providing various ancient Marathi inscription sites.\n4. Gathering information on the location and specifics of ancient Marathi inscriptions, among other relevant details.\n Archaeology Experts:\nEngaging in communication with experts in the field of archaeology is a crucial approach to gathering data. These experts possess deep knowledge of ancient inscriptions and various ancient languages. Discussions with these experts help collect images and analyze image data. They also consulted with various archaeology Professors to find inscription reading methods, ancient Marathi characters, writing styles, inscription site locations, and relevant literature. During these discussions with experts, variations in each character were identified, which were documented for future research work. \nField Visits and Observations:\nObtaining reliable evidence through field visits and observation is very useful. The authors conducted field visits to Tuljapur, Pandharpur, Nashik, and other locations in the Solapur district, capturing original photos of relevant inscriptions. Additionally, they engaged with various tourists to gather data.  A DSLR camera was utilized to capture photos of inscriptions. The authors noted that identifying suitable inscriptions was challenging throughout these visits.\nInscription image selection:\n            In the preliminary investigation, an experimental study involved collecting and analyzing three distinct types of inscription images. These types include stone, document, and metal plate inscriptions. The inscription font, style, and size are not standard. However, a document uses standard font, style, and size. In stone inscriptions, characters are carved by different individuals, leading to font, style, and character variations. Binarization of documents proves more suitable for enhancing document images. Initially, enhancement based on binarization is applied to all three types of inscriptions, and various metrics are used to check accuracy. The findings reveal that the accuracy of stone inscription images is lower than the other types. For this research, stone inscription images are specifically chosen.\nImages are captured by using a digital camera NIKON D7200 (Focal Length -140 mm, Horizontal and vertical resolution -300*300 dpi, Bit depth-24, Max Aperture- 5, Metering mode- Pattern, Flash Mode \u2013 No flash)\n",
