I have always seen that machine learning and deep learning have solved most of the modern days' problems be it financial or linguistic or medical and healthcare-related. A.I. has always surpassed our expectations.<br>\n But could A.I. algorithms find its way to the solution in case of astronomy?. Yes, it could. But the most challenging thing which I found, in this case, was the availability of sufficient data.  <br>\nAlthough the struggle to find appropriate data to work with was not much longer. I finally came across this dataset which is officially maintained by **Jet Propulsion Laboratory of California Institute of Technology** which is an organization under **NASA**. With this, I also found my way to solve the most interesting problem, which is to predict asteroid diameter with A.I. algorithm.<br>\nI researched this topic and found that the prediction of asteroid diameter is not an easy job.
