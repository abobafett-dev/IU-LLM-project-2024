I decided to share the dataset with 21 classes of different package recycle symbols for beginners to try DNNs for their classification.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nAll pictures are taken from local shops in Poland.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nHope you will learn not only image classification but also learn the meaning of the recycling symbols so you also can make a positive impact on our ecology! \n\nP.S. small hint - black and white images might boost you accuracy ;) ",
