This encompasses the newly introduced banknotes of 10 and 20 Egyptian Pounds.\n\nCurrency Denominations:\n\n- 5 Egyptian Pound Banknote\n- 10 Egyptian Pound Banknote\n- 20 Egyptian Pound Banknote\n- New 10 Egyptian Pound Banknote\n- New 20 Egyptian Pound Banknote\n- 50 Egyptian Pound Banknote\n- 100 Egyptian Pound Banknote\n- 200 Egyptian Pound Banknote\n\n# Image Diversity:\n\nTo enhance the dataset's utility, each currency denomination is captured from multiple perspectives, under diverse lighting conditions, and against different backgrounds. This approach ensures a robust dataset that reflects real-world scenarios, making it valuable for a broad spectrum of applications.\n\n# Capture Positions:\n\nFrontal Views: Images taken from a head-on perspective to capture the primary features of each banknote.\nAngled Shots: Variably angled shots to simulate natural variations in viewing angles.\nRotated Positions: Images capturing banknotes at different orientations to improve model robustness.\nBackground Variations:\n\nThe dataset includes images taken against various backgrounds to simulate real-world usage scenarios. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\nPlain backgrounds for controlled environments.\nNatural settings with textured surfaces.\nVaried lighting conditions to account for potential challenges.\n\n# Technical Details:\n\nImage Resolution: High-resolution images enable detailed analysis and contribute to the dataset's overall quality.\n\nFormat: Standardized image formats facilitate seamless integration into machine learning pipelines.\n\n# Intended Use:\nResearchers and developers exploring currency recognition, object detection, and classification in the realms of computer vision and artificial intelligence can leverage this dataset. Its unique characteristics make it a versatile resource for refining algorithms across a spectrum of applications.",
