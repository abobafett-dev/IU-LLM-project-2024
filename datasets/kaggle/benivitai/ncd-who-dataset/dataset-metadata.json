  "descriptionNullable": "## Context\n\nIn the shadows of the Covid-19 pandemic, there is another global health crisis that has gone largely unnoticed. This is the Noncommunicable Disease (NCD) pandemic.\n\n[The WHO website](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/noncommunicable-diseases) describes NCDs as follows:\n&gt; Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, tend to be of long duration and are the result of a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behaviours factors.\n\n&gt; The main types of NCDs are cardiovascular diseases (like heart attacks and stroke), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes.\n\n&gt; NCDs disproportionately affect people in low- and middle-income countries where more than three quarters of global NCD deaths \u2013 32million \u2013 occur.\n\n### Key facts:\n&gt; * Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) kill 41 million people each year, equivalent to 71% of all deaths globally.\n&gt; * Each year, 15 million people die from a NCD between the ages of 30 and 69 years; over 85% of these \"premature\" deaths occur in low- and middle-income &gt; * countries.\n&gt; * Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths, or 17.9 million people annually, followed by cancers (9.0 million), respiratory diseases (3.9million), and diabetes (1.6 million).\n&gt; * These 4 groups of diseases account for over 80% of all premature NCD deaths.\n&gt; * Tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy diets all increase the risk of dying from a NCD.\n&gt; * Detection, screening and treatment of NCDs, as well as palliative care, are key components of the response to NCDs.\n\n## Content\n\nThis data repository consists of 3 CSV files: WHO-cause-of-death-by-NCD.csv is the main dataset, which provides the percentage of deaths caused by NCDs out of all causes of death, for each nation globally. Metadata_Country.csv and Metadata_Indicator.csv provide additional metadata which is helpful for interpreting the main CSV.\n\nThe data collected spans a period from 2000 to 2016. The main CSV has columns for every year from 1960 to 2019. It is advisable to drop all redundant columns where no data was collected.\n\nFurthermore, it is advisable to merge Metadata_Country.csv with the main CSV as it provides valuable additional information, particularly on the economic situation of each nation.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset has been extracted from [The World Bank 'Cause of death, by non-communicable diseases (% of total)' Dataset](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DTH.NCOM.ZS), derived based on the data from WHO's Global Health Estimates.

Would be great to see some choropleth visualisations to get an idea of which regions are most affected by NCDs.",
