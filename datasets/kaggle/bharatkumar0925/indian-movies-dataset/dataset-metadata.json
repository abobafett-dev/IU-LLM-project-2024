  "descriptionNullable": "### About the Dataset:\n\nThis dataset contains more than 3000 movies, which can be beneficial for recommendation systems. Two files are available: `indian-movies.csv` and `clean-data.csv`. While both files contain the same data, `indian-movies.csv` includes raw data that can also be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prabhakarz/tmdb-15000-movies-dataset-with-credits). The `clean-data.csv` file includes cleaned information, such as extracted actors and character names from the `cast` column, and directors and producers from the `crew` column. Additionally, unnecessary or less relevant information has been removed. The data has been cleaned by removing trailing and leading spaces, and converting all data to lowercase, among other steps.\n\n### Uses of this Dataset:\n\nThis dataset can serve various purposes, including:\n\n- **Movie Analysis:**\n  - What are the most popular movies?\n  - Who are the most successful actors/directors in terms of popular movies?\n  - What is the relation between popular movies and title length?\n  - Which month's movie releases are more successful?\n  - Which genres are more frequently produced than others?\n  Note: Define your criteria for popular movies first.\n\n- **Recommendation Systems**\n- **Prediction of Popularity Score, Vote Average, and Vote Count**\n\n### Data Information of `clean-data.csv`:\n\n- `movie_id`: ID of the movie\n- `overview`: Overview of the movie\n- `popularity`: Popularity score from TMDB\n- `release_date`: Release date\n- `title`: Title of the movie\n- `vote_average`: Average vote\n- `vote_count`: Total votes\n- `genres`: Genre of the movie\n- `keywords`: Movie keywords\n- `month`: Release month\n- `year`: Release year\n- `director`: Director of the movie\n- `producer`: Producer of the movie\n- `actors`: Top 3 actors of the movie\n- `characters`: Top 3 characters of the movie\n- `tags`: Combination of all relevant attributes of the movie, such as overview, keywords, actors, etc.\n",
