Because we need to compare the semantics of information present in both of the modalities \u2014 the image and natural language question related to it \u2014 VQA entails a wide range of sub-problems in both CV and NLP (such as object detection and recognition, scene classification, counting, and so on). Thus, it is considered an AI-complete task.\n\n",
