In addition to professionally shot high-resolution product images, we also have multiple label attributes describing the product which were manually entered while cataloging. To add, we also have descriptive text commenting on the product characteristics.\n\n# Content\n- Each product is identified by an ID like 42431. You will find a map of all the products in styles.csv. From here, you can fetch the image for this product from images/42431.jpg. To get started easily, we have exposed some key product categories and their display names in styles.csv.\n\n# Inspiration\nSo what can you try building? Here are some suggestions:\n- Start with an image classifier. Use the masterCategory column from styles.csv and train a convolutional neural network.\n- Try adding more sophisticated classification by predicting the other category labels in styles.csv",
