This dataset is aimed at researchers and developers in the field of computer vision and facial recognition, who are looking to train and test their algorithms on a diverse range of facemask images. Each image is labeled with information such as the type of mask worn, whether it covers the entire face or just the mouth and nose, and the presence of other objects in the image that might affect facial recognition accuracy. The dataset is divided into two sets: a mask-images set and a no-mask images set. With this diverse and well-annotated dataset, users will be able to explore the challenges and limitations of facial recognition technology in the era of widespread facemask usage.",
