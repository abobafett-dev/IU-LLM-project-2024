It also has metadata of each coin in the coins table. Be careful, id is used because 2 or more cryptocurrencies can have the same symbol, and or a coin could change symbol over time. This dataset would be updated monthly to stay up to date.\n\n### Historical\nThe dataset contains historical csv&table, which is scraped from [coinmarketcap historical snapshot](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical) and OHLC columns were scraped from each coin's [historical-data page](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/). One thing to note is that the rows scraped for each date are not just the top 100 or 200 but everything. Some days have over 4000 coins.\n\nThe columns are date, coin\\_id, cmc\\_rank, market\\_cap, price, open, high, low, close, time\\_high, time\\_low, volume\\_24h, percent\\_change\\_1h, percent\\_change\\_24h, percent\\_change\\_7d, circulating\\_supply, total\\_supply, max\\_supply, num\\_market_pairs.\n\n### Coins\nThis contains almost all the available data about each coin. There's id, name, slug, symbol, status, category, description, subreddit, notice. status==extinct are for coins that are no longer on coimarketcap and therefore the data are gotten from historical. description seems to be in markdown.\n\nThen there's tags, tag\\_names, website, twitter, message\\_board, chat, explorer, reddit, technical\\_doc, source\\_code, announcement, which are \", \" (comma space) seperated list. Then platform\\_id, date\\_added, date\\_launched.\n\nUpvote if you like the dataset. Thanks and enjoy.",
