And it makes it harder for us to trust any piece of information we come across! Not only that, now the bad actors are able to use language modelling tools like Open AI's GPT 2 to generate fake news too. Ever since its initial release, there have been talks on how it can be potentially misused for generating misleading news articles, automating the production of abusive or fake content for social media, and automating the creation of spam and phishing content.\n\nHow do we figure out what is true and what is fake? Can we do something about it?\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset consists of around 387,000 pieces of text which has  been sourced from various news articles on the web as well as texts generated by Open AI's GPT 2 language model!\n\nThe dataset is split into train, validation and test such that each of the sets has an equal split of the two classes.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset was published on AI Crowd in a so-called KIIT AI (mini)Blitz\u26a1 Challenge. AI Blitz\u26a1 is a series of educational challenges by AIcrowd, with an aim to make it really easy for anyone to get started with the world of AI.
