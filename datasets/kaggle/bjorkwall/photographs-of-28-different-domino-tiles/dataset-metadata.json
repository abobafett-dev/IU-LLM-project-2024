I hired a Virtual Assistant to take photographs of a subset of domino tiles to make a proof of concept in terms of image detection, and as my app project never came true I thought I'd share it here.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe images consist of 28 different domino tiles (i.e. not a full set) of domino tiles in a 1-9 points per tile game. Each photo is just of one domino tile per image, with different rotation and zoom. The images are in jpg-format.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThese photographs were mainly taken by my Virtual Assistant Mary Anne Remulla.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nCould this be the start of an app that would count the sum of all points in domino tiles on a table, calculate your best next move given the table layout etc.?",
