Looking at the amazing response and demand for more, we continued the hackathons over the weekends every week. Janatahack today is a phenomena where loads of esteemed members of our community regularly participate to showcase their machine learning skills by sharing their approaches and more important to learn how to apply machine learning and predictive analytics to new domains such as agriculture, Banking, IOT, forecasting and so on. \n\nThis time we bring to you hackathon, this time a 10 day extravaganza launching on the independence day for India, 15th August 2020. Open to all data practitioners, beginners in data science and data scientists. Register today to test your skills and earn AV Points. The theme for this hackathon will be launched on the independence day along with the problem statement and the dataset. So stay tuned and register today to receive all the updates regarding this exciting event.\n\n\n### Content\n\nResearchers have access to large online archives of scientific articles. As a consequence, finding relevant articles has become more difficult. Tagging or topic modelling provides a way to give token of identification to research articles which facilitates recommendation and search process.\n\nGiven the abstract and title for a set of research articles, predict the topics for each article included in the test set. \n\nNote that a research article can possibly have more than 1 topic. The research article abstracts and titles are sourced from the following 6 topics: \n\n1. Computer Science\n\n2. Physics\n\n3. Mathematics\n\n4. Statistics\n\n5. Quantitative Biology\n\n6. Quantitative Finance\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to Analytics Vidhya for the Dataset\n",
