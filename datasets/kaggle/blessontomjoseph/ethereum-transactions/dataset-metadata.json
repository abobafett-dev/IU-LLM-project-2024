Smart contracts allow participants to transact with each other without a trusted central authority. Transaction records are immutable, verifiable, and securely distributed across the network, giving participants full ownership and visibility into transaction data. Transactions are sent from and received by user-created Ethereum accounts. A sender must sign transactions and spend Ether, Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, as a cost of processing transactions on the network.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Here is the most recent 100,000 Eth transactions, Updated weekly \ud83d\udcc6\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Please upvote if you download it, or find it useful \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\ude4f",
