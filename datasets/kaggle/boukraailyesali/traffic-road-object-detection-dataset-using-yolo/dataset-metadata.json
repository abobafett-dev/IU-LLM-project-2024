The dataset is derived from publicly available video content on YouTube, specifically from the video with the Creative Commons Attribution license, available [here](https://youtu.be/MNn9qKG2UFI?si=uJz_WicTCl8zfrVl).\n![youtube video](https://youtu.be/MNn9qKG2UFI?si=uJz_WicTCl8zfrVl)\n\n**Source:**\n\n- Video Source: YouTube Video.\n- License: Creative Commons Attribution (reuse allowed) more details [here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797468).\n- Dataset Contents:\nThe dataset consists of a collection of image frames extracted from the video. Each image frame captures various scenes from road traffic. Car objects within these frames are annotated with bounding boxes.\n\n**Annotation Details:**\n\n- Bounding Boxes: Each image frame contains annotated bounding boxes around car objects, marking their locations in the scene.\n- Classes: The dataset is focused on car object detection, and car objects are labeled as the target class (aka one class only).\n- Data Format: Images are provided in JPEG format.\n- Annotation files are provided in YOLO text format.\n- We used **labelImg** GUI to label this dataset in YOLO format, more details are in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/HumanSignal/labelImg).\n\n**Use Cases:**\n\n- Object Detection: This dataset can be used to train and evaluate object detection models, with an emphasis on detecting cars in road traffic scenarios.\n\n**Acknowledgments:**\nWe acknowledge and thank the creator of the original video for making it available under a Creative Commons Attribution license.
