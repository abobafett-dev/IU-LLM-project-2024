  "descriptionNullable": "## Context\n\nRead by students, scholars, critics, and the curious for millennia, the Holy Bible is the most translated, most widely published, and most examined text in history. Unfortunately, the information in Scripture largely has remained unstructured and not easily parsed, examined, processed, or enriched with modern technology.  This series of datasets is intended to make the *information* in the Bible accessible to these technologies.\n\n\n## Content\n\nThere are several files and, while some are complete (minus any corrections that are identified over time), many are still in development.\n\n#### **BibleData-Reference** [complete]\nBased on the Unified Scripture XML (USX) labels for each book, this dataset provides unique identifiers for each book, chapter, and verse in the 66 books of the Bible.  The reference IDs in this dataset are used throughout other BibleData datasets.  The dataset is complete (but open to corrections) as of 4/7/2021.\n\n#### **BibleData-Commandments** [complete]\nThis dataset contains detailed information about the (traditionally enumerated) 613 commandments found in the Bible with chapter and verse references (keyed to the BibleData-Reference dataset) and related source texts in Hebrew, Greek, and English to facilitate individual verification and study.  This dataset is complete (but open to corrections) as of 1/31/2021.\n\n#### **HebrewStrongs** [complete]\nA dataset of all the words used in the Hebrew Bible as organized by James Strong in his Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary.  Based on the work of Matthias Mueller (https://christthetruth.net/2013/07/15/strongs-goes-excel/), this data is organized by Strong's number, one entry per number.  This dataset is complete (but open for corrections) as of 2/29/2020.\n\n#### **NavesTopicalDictionary** [complete]\nNaves 1897 Topical Dictionary in structured data format.  This data is alphabetically organized, with one entry per topic.  This dataset is complete (but open for corrections) as of 6/5/2020.\n\n#### **HitchcocksBibleNamesDictionary** [complete]\nRoswell D. Hitchcock's Bible Names Dictionary (1869) in a structured data format.  This data is alphabetically organized, with one entry per name.  This dataset is complete (but open for corrections) as of 6/5/2020.\n\n#### **The Alamo Polyglot** [complete]\nThis dataset is the work of a Bible student in San Antonio, Texas, USA, seeking to integrate the plain-text (UTF-8) data of ancient Bible manuscripts into one source and make it freely available to others for their own studies.  This dataset is complete (but open for additions or corrections!) as of 8/29/2020.\n\nThis single, parallel view of various texts and translations of Scripture includes:\n- World English Bible [WEB]\n- King James Version [KJV]\n- Leningrad Codex [BHS]\n- Jewish Publication Society [JPS 1917]\n- Codex Alexandrinus\n- Brenton's English Translation of Alexandrinus [BET]\n- Samaritan Pentateuch [SP]\n- Samaritan Pentateuch In English [SPE]\n- Targum Onkelos\n- Targum Onkelos in English [TOE])\n\n#### **BibleData-Book** [in progress]\nThis dataset contains basic information about each of the 66 books in the Bible: book names in English, Hebrew, and Greek (along with transliterations and meanings of those names), chapter and verse counts, along with details of who wrote each book, when, and where (if known). This dataset is still in development as of 5/16/2020.\n\n#### **BibleData-Person** [in progress]\nInformation about each named individual in the Bible with chapter and verse references (keyed to the BibleData-Reference dataset) to facilitate individual verification and study. This list serves as the foundation for the BibleData-PersonLabel (with English, Hebrew, and Greek labels including chapter and verse) and the BibleData-PersonRelationship (noting parental, marital, or other relationships between individuals in the Bible). This dataset is incomplete (only Genesis 1:1-Psalm 1:1) but still in development as of 12/18/2021.\n\n#### **BibleData-PersonLabel** [in progress]\nThis dataset contains detailed information about the English, Hebrew, and Greek labels (proper names, titles, etc.) given to individuals mentioned in the Bible (keyed to the BibleData-Person dataset) along with their meanings and the chapter and verse references (keyed to the BibleData-Reference dataset) to facilitate individual verification and study. This dataset is incomplete (only Genesis 1:1-Psalm 1:1) but still in development as of 12/18/2021.\n\n#### **BibleData-PersonRelationship** [in progress]\nThis dataset contains information about the relationships between individuals named in the Bible including unique identifiers for each person (keyed to the BibleData-Person dataset), the relationship type (father, son, mother, daughter, wife, husband, etc), and notes along with chapter and verse references (keyed to the BibleData-Reference dataset) to facilitate individual verification and study. This dataset is incomplete (only Genesis 1:1-Psalm 1:1) but still in development as of 12/18/2021.\n\n#### **BibleData-PersonVerse** [in progress]\nThis dataset contains information about the individuals named in each chapter and verse of the Bible including unique identifiers (keyed to the BibleData-Person and BibleData-PersonLabel datasets), and notes along with chapter and verse references (keyed to the BibleData-Reference dataset) to facilitate individual verification and study.  This dataset is incomplete (only Genesis 1:1\u2014Deuteronomy 34:12) but still in development as of 12/18/2021.\n\n#### **BibleData-Epoch** [in progress]\nThis dataset contains information about periods of time (epochs) mentioned in the Bible including the beginning and ending years for the epoch (from anno hominis 1 at Creation), the key individual who defines the epoch (where applicable), and other notes along with chapter and verse references (keyed to the BibleData-Reference dataset) to facilitate individual verification and study. This dataset is still in development as of 5/8/2021.\n\n\n#### **BibleData-Event** [in progress]\nThis dataset contains information about key events mentioned in the Bible including (when identifiable) the year the event occurred (from anno hominis 1 at Creation), the key individual involved in the event, where the event occurred, and other notes along with chapter and verse references (keyed to the BibleData-Reference dataset) to facilitate individual verification and study. This dataset is still in development as of 5/8/2021.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI am thankful for everyone who has bookmarked these datasets on data.world, Git Hub, here, or elsewhere.  Each response represents a measure of encouragement to keep going because others find this information valuable.  A special word of thanks belongs to Mislav Vuleti\u0107, who was the first to perform an analysis on the data in 2021, find errors, and provide feedback to make these datasets **better** for everyone.  Thank you, sir! :)\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThese datasets are inspired by men like James Strong, Orvil Nave, and Roswell Hitchcock, who, in the 1890s *without the benefit of modern technology*, took the first steps towards making the information in the Bible more accessible to everyone.",
