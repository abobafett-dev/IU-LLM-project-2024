I do not have all DLC, so you will see quite a few 0 in DLC items\n\nI've been playing cities skyline for years and loved it. However, the game is time-consuming, so I haven't touched the game in a while. In light of the announcement of Cities Skyline II, it has sparked my interest in the game again, all I need is a justification to play it. \n\nI have been searching for a dataset to work on as my next project and found out there are a lot of datasets in regard to statistics from a city. The idea dawned on me that if I am analyzing a city's statistics, why not analyse my own city. Hence the creation of Springfield. \n\nThe data is collected using a steam workshop item called [More City Statistics](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2685974449) created by [rcav8tr](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198959572921/myworkshopfiles/?appid=255710)\n\nMajor Events\n\nSpringfield has witnessed a series of significant events that have molded its urban landscape:\n\n2024: Discovery of an oil deposit, which laid the foundation for the city's primary source of revenue. This year also saw a one-time grant of 10 million, leading to a substantial cash injection, and the initiation of the city's first bus line.\n2025: Development and commencement of operations in the Oil and farming industries.\n2027: Introduction of the tram line and the inauguration of the Central Park.\n2028: Opening of the city's university.\n2030: Upgrades to utility systems, including nuclear power and water treatment facilities.\n2036: Opening of passenger and cargo airports.\n2040s: Springfield reaches full urbanization.\n2044: The city grapples with the \"Great Congestion,\" primarily due to an upsurge in trucks delivering goods, which the existing infrastructure couldn't support.\n2047: Introduction of the metro system.\n2045-2065: Implementation of extensive road reforms, with a primary focus on the oil-rich areas. This period also saw the introduction of a new highway, toll booths to regulate traffic flow and recover costs, banning of external vehicles in downtown, optimization of bus and tram routes, and the establishment of a more walkable city layout.\n2065-2069: Expansion and optimization of the oil areas, emphasizing refining oil and plastic production over raw crude oil production.\n2069: Implementation of the Tax Reduction Act.\n\n**Gallary**\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F13710878%2Fbbbaa8d14afd56945eef4b69f499419f%2F20230719072216_1%20-%20Copy.jpg?generation=1691162526803072&alt=media)\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F13710878%2Fce17e8f8c1b96f92a28d6bc58ee8fac9%2F20230719072411_1%20-%20Copy.jpg?generation=1691162573788287&alt=media)\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F13710878%2F55ca6d902c59c7ff2500670ff76e7c93%2F20230719072609_1%20-%20Copy.jpg?generation=1691162621739170&alt=media)\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F13710878%2F2c0fffa2ee428cb2100dfb338ab0b6be%2F20230719072710_1%20-%20Copy.jpg?generation=1691162642523757&alt=media)",
