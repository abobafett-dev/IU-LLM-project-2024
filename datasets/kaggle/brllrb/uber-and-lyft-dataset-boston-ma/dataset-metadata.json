It is a good dataset if you want to use a Linear Regression Model to see the pattern between different predectors such as `hour` and `price`.\n\nA really amazing part of this dataset is that I have included the corresponding `weather data` for that `hour` with a short summary of the `weather`. Other important factors are `temperature`, `wind`, and `sunset`. ",
