The nervous system accomplishes this with a  corollary discharge forward model system in which an \"efference copy\" of an impending motor plan is transmitted from motor to sensory cortex where it generates a \"corollary discharge\" representation of the expected sensory consequences of the imminent motor act.  For example, when you move your eyes from left to right, your brain knows the environment is not shifting.  When you speak, your auditory cortex has a reduced response to the expected sound of your voice.\n\nSchizophrenia is a chronic mental illness that affects about 1% of people across the globe.  One possible explanation for some of the symptoms of schizophrenia is that one or more problems with the corollary discharge process in the nervous system makes it difficult for patients to differentiate between internally and externally generated stimuli.  Therefore, studying this process and its relationship to symptoms in the illness might allow us to better understand abnormal brain processes in patients with this diagnosis.\n\nIn a previously published EEG experiment ([full report][2]), we used a simple button pressing task in which subjects either (1) pressed a button to immediately generated a tone, (2) passively listened to the same tone, or (3) pressed a button without generating a tone to study the corollary discharge in people with schizophrenia and comparison controls.  We found that comparison controls suppressed the N100, a negative deflection in EEG brain wave 100 milliseconds after the onset of a sound, when they pressed a button to generate a tone compared to passive playback, but patients with schizophrenia did not.  This data set is a larger sample replication of that previous study.  Specifically, EEG data from 22 controls and 36 patients with schizophrenia have been combined with 10 controls and 13 patients from the previous report.\n\n### Methods\n\nDue to the size of the raw EEG data, some pre-processing was done prior to upload.  EEG data acquisition parameters and the experimental task was identical to that described in our paper.  However, pre-processing differed.  All individual subject data had at least the following data processing steps applied, in this order:\n\n 1. Re-reference to averaged ear lobes\n\n2.  0.1 Hz high-pass filter\n\n3.  Interpolation of outlier channels in the continuous EEG data (outliers defined as in [this paper][3])\n\n4.  Chop continous data into single trial epochs 1.5 seconds before and after task events (3s total)\n\n5.  Baseline correction -100 to 0ms\n\n6.  Canonical correlation analysis to remove muscle and high-frequency white noise artifacts\n\n7.  Rejection of outlier single trials (outliers defined as in [this paper][4])\n\n8.  Removal of outlier components from a spatial independent components analysis (outliers defined as in [this paper][5])\n\n9.  Interpolation of outlier channels within single trials (outliers defined as in [this paper][6])\n\nDerived data includes event-related potential (ERP) averages for 9 electrode sites analyzed in our previous report, including Fz, FCz, Cz, FC3, FC4, C3, C4, CP3, CP4 (pictured below):\n\n![montage][7]\n\nThe ERPs are calculated by averaging across trials for every sample in the time series, separately for each subject, electrode, and condition.\n\n### Content\n\nThe single trial data from all 64 channels are too large to be uploaded for all 81 subjects, but those interested in that type of data will find one subject (subject 21 in **21.csv**) among the data files.  This includes all his data after the pre-processing step 9 listed above.\n\nFor those interested in comparing patients with schizophrenia to control subjects, the **ERPdata.csv** file contains the averaged, ERP time series for all subjects, conditions, and the 9 electrodes mentioned above.  These data, along with the subject information in **demographic.csv** could be used to replicate the analyses in our prior report.\n\nFor those interested in single trial categorization/prediction like the [grasp-and-lift][8] challenge or the [face decoding][9] challenge, the **mergedTrialData.csv** contains summary measurements from nearly 24,000 individual trials (all subjects and conditions are included).\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nFunding for the study procedures, initial analyses and publications came from the National Institute of Mental Health.
