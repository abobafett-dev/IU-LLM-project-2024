Given the unique spatial and spectral resolution of the data, the VIIRS 375 m fire detection algorithm was customized and tuned in order to optimize its response over small fires while balancing the occurrence of false alarms. Frequent saturation of the mid-infrared I4 channel (3.55-3.93 \u00b5m) driving the detection of active fires requires additional tests and procedures to avoid pixel classification errors. As a result, sub-pixel fire characterization (e.g., fire radiative power [FRP] retrieval) is only viable across small and/or low-intensity fires. Systematic FRP retrievals are based on a hybrid approach combining 375 and 750 m data.

Without an associated uncertainty, however, FRP-based biomass burning estimates cannot be confidently compared across space and time, or against estimates derived from alternative methodologies. Differences in the per-pixel FRP measured near-simultaneously in consecutive MODIS scans are approximately normally distributed with a standard deviation (\u03c3\u03b7) of 26.6%. Simulations demonstrate that this uncertainty decreases to less than ~5% (at \u00b11 \u03c3\u03b7) for aggregations larger than ~50 MODIS active fire pixels. Although FRP uncertainties limit the confidence in flux estimates on a per-pixel basis, the sensitivity of biomass burning estimates to FRP uncertainties can be mitigated by conducting inventories at coarser spatiotemporal resolutions.\n\nhttp://cedadocs.ceda.ac.uk/770/1/SEVIRI_FRP_documentdesc.pdf\n\n* Type\n(Inferred hot spot type)\n\n0 = presumed vegetation fire\n\n1 = active volcano\n\n2 = other static land source\n\n3 = offshore detection (includes all detections over water)\n\n* DayNight\n(Day or Night)\n\nD= Daytime fire\n\nN= Nighttime fire",
