First, I scrap the main page to get all general information and then, I scraped each player's webpage that is associated. I defined a batch size so I can parallelize the retrieving of the data. Then I merge all dataframes and cleaned the merged one. I have only 4 CPU and defined 5 batches:\n- **Without batch**:  5h12\n- **With batch**: 1h39\n\nIf you have any question or suggestion, feel free to comment !\n\n## Last update\n\nI added concatenation of all dataframes. !!!
