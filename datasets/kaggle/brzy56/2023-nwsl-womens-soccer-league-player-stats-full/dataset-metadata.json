NaNs means there was no data available. For example, goalkeeping saves, 0 is a meaningful statistical number. But you can drop and clean NaNs for your own purposes on your own.\n\nPercentages are in whole numbers.\n\n2024 season stats and stadium attendance stats will be added soon. \n\nMessage me for other women's sports ideas and variables to include.
