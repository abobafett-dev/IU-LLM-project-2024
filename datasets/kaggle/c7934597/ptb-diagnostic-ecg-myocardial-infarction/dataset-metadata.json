Automatic ECG interpretation algorithms as diagnosis support systems promise large reliefs for the medical personnel - only on the basis of the number of ECGs that are routinely taken. However, the development of such algorithms requires large training datasets and clear benchmark procedures. In our opinion, both aspects are not covered satisfactorily by existing freely accessible ECG datasets.",
