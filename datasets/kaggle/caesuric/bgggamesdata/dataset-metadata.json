And thanks to the many users that powered this data by providing scores, tagging mechanics, etc.!\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI'd love to get a better understanding of the correlations between various game attributes and how they are rated on BGG. It might also be fun to correlate with the \"owned\" property to get a rough measure of what qualities in games drive sales (at least among the BGG community).",
