While not an exhaustive collection of mass shootings, it is a high-quality dataset ranging from 1966 to 2016 with well-defined methodology, definitions and source URLs for user validation. \n\nThis dataset can be used to validate other datasets, such as [us-mass-shootings-last-50-years](https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/us-mass-shootings-last-50-years), which contains more recent data, or conduct other analysis, as more information is provided. \n\n# Content\n\nThis dataset contains data by the MSA project both from it's [website](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/mass-shootings-america) and from it's [Github account](https://github.com/StanfordGeospatialCenter/MSA). The difference between the two sources is only on the data format (i.e. .csv versus .geojson for the data, or .csv versus .pdf for the dictionary).\n\n- **mass_shooting_events**_stanford_msa_release_06142016\n   - Contains a nonexaustive list of US Mass Shootings from 1966 to 2016 in both .csv and .geojson formats.\n- **dictionary**_stanford_msa_release_06142016\n   - Contains the data dictionary in .csv and .pdf formats. Note the .pdf format provides an easier way to visualize sub-fields.\n\n**Note the data was reproduced here without any modifications other than file renaming for clarity, the content is the same as in the source.**\n\nThe following sections are reproduced from the dataset creators [website](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/mass-shootings-america). For more details, please see the source.\n\n## Project background\n\nThe Stanford Mass Shootings of America (MSA) data project began in 2012, in reaction to the mass shooting in Sandy Hook, CT. In our initial attempts to map this phenomena it was determined that no comprehensive collection of these incidents existed online. The Stanford Geospatial Center set out to create, as best we could, a single point repository for as many mass shooting events as could be collected via online media. The result was the Stanford MSA.\n\n## What the Stanford MSA is\n\nThe Stanford MSA is a data aggregation effort. It is a curated set of spatial and temporal data about mass shootings in America, taken from online media sources. It is an attempt to facilitate research on gun violence in the US by making raw data more accessible.\n\n## What the Stanford MSA is not\n\nThe Stanford MSA is not a comprehensive, longitudinal research project. The data collected in the MSA are not investigated past the assessment for inclusion in the database. The MSA is not an attempt to answer specific questions about gun violence or gun laws.\n\nThe Stanford Geospatial Center does not provide analysis or commentary on the contents of this database or any derivatives produced with it.\n\n## Data collection methodology\n\nThe information collected for the Stanford MSA is limited to online resources. An initial intensive investigation was completed looking back over existing online reports to fill in the historic record going back to 1966. Contemporary records come in as new events occur and are cross referenced against a number of online reporting sources. In general a minimum of three corroborating sources are required to add the full record into the MSA (as many as 6 or 7 sources may have been consulted in many cases). All sources for each event are listed in the database.\n\nDue to the time involved in vetting the details of any new incident, there is often a 2 to 4 week lag between a mass shooting event and its inclusion in the public release database.\n\nIt is important to note the records in the Stanford MSA span a time from well before the advent of online media reporting, through its infancy, to the modern era of web based news and information resources. Researchers using this database need to be aware of the reporting bias these changes in technology present. A spike in incidents for recent years is likely due to increased online reporting and not necessarily indicative of the rate of mass shootings alone. Researchers should look at this database as a curated collection of quality checked data regarding mass shootings, and not an exhaustive research data set itself. Independent verification and analysis will be required to use this data in examining trends in mass shootings over time.\n\n## Definition of Mass Shooting\n\nThe definition of mass shooting used for the Stanford database is 3 or more shooting victims (not necessarily fatalities), not including the shooter. The shooting must not be identifiably gang, drug, or organized crime related.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThe Stanford Mass Shootings in America (MSA) is a dataset released under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 international license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) by the Stanford Geospatial Center.\n\n## How to cite the MSA\n\nThe Stanford MSA is released under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 international license. Please cite the MSA as \u201cStanford Mass Shootings in America, courtesy of the Stanford Geospatial Center and Stanford Libraries\u201d.\n\n# Inspiration\n\nThere is already a great number of interesting datasets in Kaggle surrounding the subject of Mass Shootings, however, little has been done leveraging information from multiple sources. Can you see a story among them? Can we learn anything, for example, comparing the different sources by city or state? \n\n**From a bigger picture**\n\n - Leading Causes of Death in US: https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/mortality\n - Gun Violence Database:\n   https://www.kaggle.com/gunviolencearchive/gun-violence-database\n - Gun Deaths in US: https://www.kaggle.com/hakabuk/gun-deaths-in-the-us\n - Homicide Reports:\n   https://www.kaggle.com/murderaccountability/homicide-reports\n - Global Terrorism Database: https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd\n - Crime Rates in America:\n   https://www.kaggle.com/marshallproject/crime-rates\n\n**\"Prevention?**\n\n - Firearms Provisions in US States: https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/state-firearms\n - Trial and Terror: https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/trial-and-terror\n - Connecticut Inmates Waiting trial: https://www.kaggle.com/Connecticut-open-data/connecticut-inmates-awaiting-trial\n\n\n**Are there warning signs?**\n\n  - Mental Health in Tech Survey: https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016/data (Not directly related but can be used to make a parenthesis about mental health being an issue in our surroundings).\n",
