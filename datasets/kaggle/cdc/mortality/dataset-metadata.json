This [mortality dataset](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm) is a record of every death in the country for 2005 through 2015, including detailed information about causes of death and the demographic background of the deceased.\n\nIt's been said that \"statistics are human beings with the tears wiped off.\" This is especially true with this dataset. Each death record represents somebody's loved one, often connected with a lifetime of memories and sometimes tragically too short.\n\nPutting the sensitive nature of the topic aside, analyzing mortality data is essential to understanding the complex circumstances of death across the country. The US Government uses this data to determine life expectancy and understand how death in the U.S. differs from the rest of the world. Whether you\u2019re looking for macro trends or analyzing unique circumstances, we challenge you to use this dataset to find your own answers to one of life\u2019s great mysteries.\n\n# Overview\n\nThis dataset is a collection of CSV files each containing one year's worth of data and paired JSON files containing the code mappings, plus an ICD 10 code set. The CSVs were reformatted from their original fixed-width file formats using information extracted from the CDC's PDF manuals using [this script](https://gist.github.com/SohierDane/0f2cf7a8538ca35431dd7575ac38e7ca). Please note that this process may have introduced errors as the text extracted from the pdf is not a perfect match. If you have any questions or find errors in the preparation process, please leave a note in the forums. We hope to publish additional years of data using this method soon.\n\nA more detailed overview of the data can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_public_use_data.htm). You'll find that the fields are consistent within this time window, but some of data codes change every few years. For example, the 113_cause_recode entry 069 only covers ICD codes (I10,I12) in 2005, but by 2015 it covers (I10,I12,I15). When I post data from years prior to 2005, expect some of the fields themselves to change as well.\n\nAll data comes from the CDC\u2019s [National Vital Statistics Systems](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm#Mortality_Multiple), with the exception of the [Icd10Code](http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/), which are sourced from the World Health Organization.\n\n## Project ideas\n\n - The CDC's mortality data was the basis of a [widely publicized paper](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/health/death-rates-rising-for-middle-aged-white-americans-study-finds.html), by Anne Case and Nobel prize winner Angus Deaton, arguing that middle-aged whites are dying at elevated rates. [One of the criticisms against the paper](http://andrewgelman.com/2015/11/18/first-second-and-third-order-bias-corrections-also-my-ugly-r-code-for-the-mortality-rate-graphs/) is that it failed to properly account for the exact ages within the broad bins available through the [CDC's WONDER tool](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html). What do these results look like with exact/not-binned age data?\n - Similarly, how sensitive are the mortality trends being discussed in the news to the choice of bin-widths?\n - As noted above, the data preparation process could have introduced errors. Can you find any discrepancies compared to the aggregate metrics on [WONDER](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html)? If so, please let me know in the forums!\n - [WONDER](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html) is cited in numerous economics, sociology, and public health research papers. Can you find any papers whose conclusions would be altered if they used the exact data available here rather than binned data from Wonder?\n\n## Differences from the first version of the dataset\n\n - This version of the dataset was prepared in a completely different many. This has allowed us to provide a much larger volume of data and ensure that codes are available for every field.\n - We've replaced the batch of sql files with a single JSON per year. Kaggle's platform currently offer's better support for JSON files, and this keeps the number of files manageable.\n - A tutorial kernel providing a quick introduction to the new format is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/mortality-data-format-v2-tutorial/).\n - Lastly, I apologize if the transition has interrupted anyone's work!
