  "descriptionNullable": "# Context \n\nThe [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)](https://www.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/about_nhanes.htm) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations. NHANES is a major program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and has the responsibility for producing vital and health statistics for the Nation.\n\nThe NHANES program began in the early 1960s and has been conducted as a series of surveys focusing on different population groups or health topics. In 1999, the survey became a continuous program that has a changing focus on a variety of health and nutrition measurements to meet emerging needs. The survey examines a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. These persons are located in counties across the country, 15 of which are visited each year.\n\nThe NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel.\n\nTo date, [thousands of research findings have been published using the NHANES data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?orig_db=PubMed&term=NHANES&cmd=search).\n\n\n# Content\n\nThe [2013-2014 NHANES](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/Nhanes13_14.aspx) datasets include the following components:\n\n1. **Demographics dataset**: \n\n* A complete variable dictionary can be found [here](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/variablelist.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)\n\n2. **Examinations dataset**, which contains: \n\n* Blood pressure\n\n* Body measures\n\n* Muscle strength - grip test\n\n* Oral health - dentition\n\n* Taste & smell\n\n* A complete variable dictionary can be found [here](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/variablelist.aspx?Component=Examination&CycleBeginYear=2013)\n\n3. **Dietary data - total nutrient intake, first day**:  \n\n* A complete variable dictionary can be found [here](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/variablelist.aspx?Component=Dietary&CycleBeginYear=2013)\n\n4. **Laboratory dataset**, which includes: \n\n* Albumin & Creatinine - Urine\n\n* Apolipoprotein B\n\n* Blood Lead, Cadmium, Total Mercury, Selenium, and Manganese\n\n* Blood mercury: inorganic, ethyl and methyl\n\n* Cholesterol - HDL\n\n* Cholesterol - LDL & Triglycerides\n\n* Cholesterol - Total\n\n* Complete Blood Count with 5-part Differential - Whole Blood\n\n* Copper, Selenium & Zinc - Serum\n\n* Fasting Questionnaire\n\n* Fluoride - Plasma\n\n* Fluoride - Water\n\n* Glycohemoglobin\n\n* Hepatitis A\n\n* Hepatitis B Surface Antibody\n\n* Hepatitis B: core antibody, surface antigen, and Hepatitis D antibody\n\n* Hepatitis C RNA (HCV-RNA) and Hepatitis C Genotype\n\n* Hepatitis E: IgG & IgM Antibodies\n\n* Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 & Type-2\n\n* HIV Antibody Test\n\n* Human Papillomavirus (HPV) - Oral Rinse\n\n* Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA - Vaginal Swab: Roche Cobas & Roche Linear Array\n\n* Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA Results from Penile Swab Samples: Roche Linear Array\n\n* Insulin\n\n* Iodine - Urine\n\n* Perchlorate, Nitrate & Thiocyanate - Urine\n\n* Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (formerly Polyfluoroalkyl Chemicals - PFC)\n\n* Personal Care and Consumer Product Chemicals and Metabolites\n\n* Phthalates and Plasticizers Metabolites - Urine\n\n* Plasma Fasting Glucose\n\n* Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) - Urine\n\n* Standard Biochemistry Profile\n\n* Tissue Transglutaminase Assay (IgA-TTG) & IgA Endomyseal Antibody Assay (IgA EMA)\n\n* Trichomonas - Urine\n\n* Two-hour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test\n\n* Urinary Chlamydia\n\n* Urinary Mercury\n\n* Urinary Speciated Arsenics\n\n* Urinary Total Arsenic\n\n* Urine Flow Rate\n\n* Urine Metals\n\n* Urine Pregnancy Test\n\n* Vitamin B12 \n\n* A complete data dictionary can be found [here](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/variablelist.aspx?Component=Laboratory&CycleBeginYear=2013)\n\n5. **Questionnaire dataset**, which includes information on:\n\n* Acculturation\n\n* Alcohol Use\n\n* Blood Pressure & Cholesterol\n\n* Cardiovascular Health\n\n* Consumer Behavior\n\n* Current Health Status\n\n* Dermatology\n\n* Diabetes\n\n* Diet Behavior & Nutrition\n\n* Disability\n\n* Drug Use\n\n* Early Childhood\n\n* Food Security\n\n* Health Insurance\n\n* Hepatitis\n\n* Hospital Utilization & Access to Care\n\n* Housing Characteristics\n\n* Immunization\n\n* Income\n\n* Medical Conditions\n\n* Mental Health - Depression Screener\n\n* Occupation\n\n* Oral Health\n\n* Osteoporosis\n\n* Pesticide Use\n\n* Physical Activity\n\n* Physical Functioning\n\n* Preventive Aspirin Use\n\n* Reproductive Health\n\n* Sexual Behavior\n\n* Sleep Disorders\n\n* Smoking - Cigarette Use\n\n* Smoking - Household Smokers\n\n* Smoking - Recent Tobacco Use\n\n* Smoking - Secondhand Smoke Exposure\n\n* Taste & Smell\n\n* Weight History\n\n* Weight History - Youth\n\n* A complete variable dictionary can be found [here](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/variablelist.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=2013)\n\n6. **Medication dataset**, which includes prescription medications:\n\n* A complete variable dictionary can be found [here](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/variablelist.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=2013)\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nOriginal data and additional documents related to the datasets or NHANES can be found [here](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Default.aspx).",
