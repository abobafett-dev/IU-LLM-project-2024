  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset represents a collection of movies, each listed with their respective titles, overviews, and genres. Originally, the genres were provided as numeric IDs, which have been meticulously mapped to their corresponding genre names for better readability and usability. This mapping adheres to a predefined genre identification key which includes a wide range of genres from Action to Western.\n\nThe dataset has been processed to replace the numeric genre IDs with actual genre names, making it more accessible for analysis, visualization, and machine learning purposes. The updated structure facilitates easier exploration and understanding of the movie genres without needing to refer to external sources for ID decoding.\n\nThis dataset is suitable for anyone interested in film categorization, industry trend analysis, or content-based recommendation systems. It provides a foundational base for exploratory data analysis and can be used to draw insights about genre popularity, frequency, and distribution. Furthermore, the textual data in the 'overview' column can be utilized for natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, or content summarization.",
