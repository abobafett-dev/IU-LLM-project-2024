  "descriptionNullable": "Weibo is one of the mainstream social media platforms in China. Among its features, trending topics serve as an important real-time information source for Weibo users, consisting of the most popular search terms at the moment. Weibo's official platform does not provide corresponding tag information for these trending topics, making it difficult for users to access specific categories of topics. To address this issue, we collected over 6,000 trending topic data entries from November 24th to December 23rd, 2020. Each entry was manually categorized into one of eight major categories: \"(\u65f6\u653f)Politics\", \"(\u79d1\u6280)Technology\", \"(\u79d1\u666e)Popular Science\", \"(\u5a31\u4e50)Entertainment\", \"(\u4f53\u80b2)Sports\", \"(\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba8\u8bba/\u8bdd\u9898)Social Discussions/Topics\", \"(\u65f6\u4e8b)Current Affairs\" and \"(\u7ecf\u6d4e)Economy\". This categorization aims to facilitate subsequent applications. Besides, we provide another dataset of hot search that are unlabeled.\n- Politics: The current political news happening now.\n- Technology: News related to high-tech products.\n- Popular Science: News topics about popularizing knowledge.\n- Entertainment: News related to celebrities or variety shows.\n- Sports: News related to sports events or sports celebrities.\n- Social Discussions/Topics: Hot topics being discussed by the general public.\n- Current Affairs: Current social events happening now.\n- Economy: News related to the economy.",
