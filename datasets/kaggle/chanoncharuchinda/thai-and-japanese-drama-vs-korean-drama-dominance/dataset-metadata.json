I want people who **share similar interest and obsession in Korean Drama** to have access to this data to begin their exploration. Have fun!* Also, working with these two datasets simultaneously might be helpful and worth exploring.\n\n### Example Notebook\nThe Example Notebook with Data Analysis and Data Visualization will be provided after the assignment is completed. For now, it would be just how to download the data and small descriptions. \n\n#### Project and Data Information\nThis section will be updated later once I get more freetime\n\n**DISCLAIMER**: I have removed the username of the reviewers from the dataset. I used a generated `user_id` field instead for easier partition.\n\n#### What is MyDramaList.com\nAccording to mydramalist.com, \"MyDramaList.com is a community-based project which provides Asian drama & movie fans\". On the website, fans can \"create their very own drama watchlists, rate dramas and films, write reviews\" and many more engaging activities. This dataset is different from the previous one as there are more collection of data on Korean drama, reviews, and actors. \n\n#### Acknowledgements\nThis data is taken from the website https://mydramalist.com/shows/top_korean_dramas?page=1. This is my first time doing web scrapping. I wouldn't be able to do it without the help of StackOverflow and YouTube.\n\n#### Inspiration\nInitially, this was personal project, but I decided to use this data for my university project in Data Mining and Machine Learning Class.\n\nAdditionally, \"I have been a huge fan of Korean Drama and K pop since high-school. It is fun to integrate what I love with my interest toward data science\". \n\n#### Recommendation and Suggestion\nIf you would like to get more data on Korean drama, please let me know. I can get more information on drama that is prior to 2015 as well. Please leave any recommendation and suggestion (can't stop learning!). Thank you in advance!\n\nThe possibility is endless\u2026keep striving!",
