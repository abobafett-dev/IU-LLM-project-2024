Under this hashtag, thousands of artists shared their anime-style artwork and corresponding line sketches.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F6185948%2F2e5cc1db33d4e80a4d74540da65a4cbc%2F1.jpg?generation=1605875654522373&alt=media)\n  \nThere have been several research projects adopting deep learning algorithms for the anime sketch colorization. However, the training dataset they use usually contains few sketches. Most of the sketches for training are artificially generated with edge detection or similar techniques. These tweets, on the other hand, seem to be a good source of ground truth anime sketches, which may be regarded as a complementary to the current datasets.\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset contains two parts:\n\n1. stat.csv\n   - This CSV file contains the original tweets under the same hashtag between 11/14/2020 and 11/19/2020. Metadata of these tweets are generated by [Twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint/wiki/Tweet-attributes).\n2. images folder\n   - The folder contains JPG and PNG images from 3,000 tweets with the highest likes counts. The filenames are [rank of likes count]-[index of the image]-[artist twitter ID].jpg/png.\n\nNot all the artists follow the same rule posting images. Most of them post the sketch first and then the colored artwork, while there are also exceptions. Filtering and pre-processing may be required before using them as a training dataset.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI do not own any copyright of the artwork involved in this dataset. The attribution has been marked in each image filename as well as the CSV file. Please do not reuse the original images without the authorization from their authors.\nThe dataset is collected with the help of [Twint](https://github.com/twintproject).\n\n",
