  "descriptionNullable": "The GTFS, or General Transit Feed Specification, is an international standard for planning public transportation and its spatial and temporal components in metropolitan areas. The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited makes the Pune GTFS statistics available. The data is from the\nyear 2019 and covers a single day of public transportation. In total, the dataset contains 366 routes, 5624 stops, and 21,804 journeys. In 2021, the number of journeys in Pune was estimated to be around 23,000 on average. The dataset is curated by the authors from the Pune GTFS dataset by explicitly deriving multiple parameters and attributes that distinguish it from others. The data attained was categorised into 4 distinct classes using SRI (Speed Reduction Index). As a result, the massive dataset with nine csv files was condensed into a single file with minute detail on the most key facets.\n\n\u2022 stop id from is the unique identification number for a stop or a station from where the bus departs.\n\u2022 stop id to is the unique identification number for a stop or a station from where the bus is headed towards.\n\u2022 trip id is a number or a set of characters that identifies a specific trip/bus.\n\u2022 arrival time The time at which the bus arrives at a particular stop.
