I have also been actively experimenting and testing new approaches. It has been a rewarding experience, and I feel that I have learned a lot from this competition. The shared discussions, notebooks, and datasets have provided me with valuable ideas and insights.\n\nI was impressed by the informative discussion in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/discussion/465882. Inspired by it, I downloaded and reorganized the SlimPajama data from https://huggingface.co/datasets/cerebras/SlimPajama-627B/tree/main/test/chuagank1. The data was selected from RedPajamaC4 and RedPajamaWikipedia, and the word count ranges from 150 to 600. The dataset contains 1,324,132 rows, and the descriptive statistics for the \"word_count\" column are as follows:\n\n    Count: 1,324,132\n    Mean: 313.85\n    Standard Deviation: 122.98\n    Minimum: 151\n    25th Percentile: 208\n    Median: 287\n    75th Percentile: 404\n    Maximum: 599\n\n```python\n\ttext\tmeta\tlabel\tword_count\n0\tThe miniSpinner Maintenance Kit includes spare...\tRedPajamaC4\t1\t317\n1\tDo your construction site barricade graphics a...\tRedPajamaC4\t1\t287\n2\t\"The Sea in the City\" by Jenny Hanf.\\nVote for...\tRedPajamaC4\t1\t230\n3\tMoscardino is a lovely book, printed and bound...\tRedPajamaC4\t1\t172\n4\tIf you are looking for a great way to stay in ...\tRedPajamaC4\t1\t569\n...\t...\t...\t...\t...\n1324127\tFAQs | Sarasota, FL | Sarasota Fence | Owned &...\tRedPajamaC4\t1\t200\n1324128\tIt is football season again and it's time to h...\tRedPajamaC4\t1\t183\n1324129\ti am a humble simple person, who is looking fo...\tRedPajamaC4\t1\t216\n1324130\tWorking on the revamp of this 1960s home in Me...\tRedPajamaC4\t1\t183\n1324131\tIf you need to turn off O365 licenses for all ...\tRedPajamaC4\t1\t277\n```\n\nI haven't tried it yet, but I hope it will be helpful.
