  "descriptionNullable": "For a quick summary of the case study, please click \"US Economy Powerpoint\" and download the Powerpoint. \n\nThis dataset was inspired by rising prices for essential goods, the abnormally high inflation rate in March of 7.9 percent of this year, and the 30 trillion-dollar debt that we have. I was extremely curious to see how sustainable this is for the average American and if wages are increasing at the same rate to help combat this inflation. This is not politically driven in the slightest nor was this made to put the blame on Americans.

The US Economy Notebook has most of the code that I used as well as the four of the six phases of data analysis. The last two phases are in the US Economy Powerpoint. The \"US Historical Inflation Rates\" dataset could have also been labeled \"The Inflation Of The US Dollar Month By Month\". Lastly, the Average Sales of Houses in Jan is just a filtered version of \"Average Sales of Houses in the US\" dataset.",
