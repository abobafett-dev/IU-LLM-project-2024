The mental health has been declining especially for men. This decline worldwide maybe due to a multitude of other variables that may correlate such as:  internet usage/social media usage, social belonging, work hours, dating apps, and physical health. This data analysis was meant to show that men have their own issues in society that are being ignored. This decline worldwide maybe due to a multitude of other variables that may correlate such as:  internet usage/social media usage, social belonging, work hours, dating apps, and physical health. These variables may require a separate dataset going into more detail about them.\n\n A space dedicated just for men and another just for women to speak about their problems with help and constructive criticism for growth and for social belonging maybe required to improve the mental health of society (among other variables). This does not mean that the struggles of women are nonexistent. There are already a multitude of datasets and articles dedicated to some of the possible struggles of women from MSNBC, CNN, NBC, BBC, Netflix movies, and even popular secular music like recent songs WAP from Megan Thee Stallion, God is a Women by Arianna Grande, etc. This dataset's objective was not made to continue to light a flame between the already hostile relationships that modern men and women have with each other. Awareness without bias is the goal. \n\nFor the results, please read the portfolio project and leave comments.\n\n### Content\n\nWhere the data were obtained:\n\n1. The first excel file was obtained from https://data.world/vizzup/mental-health-depression-disorder-data/workspace/file?filename=Mental+health+Depression+disorder+Data.xlsx\n\n2. The second excel file was obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/male-vs-female-suicide\n\n3. The third excel file was obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/suicide\n\n4. The fourth excel file was obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/drug-use\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI want to be the best data analyst ever, so criticism (regardless of the harshness), it will be greatly appreciated. What would you have added/improved on? Was it easy to understand? What else do you want me to make a dataset on?",
