I then copied this process for 'Galar' 'Hisui' and 'Alolan' forms.\n\nI also queried for all pokemon containing 'Form' in its form column and then added the preceding portion of the string to the Name value. For example: there are 2 Blastoises in the name column, however one has an empty form value for the base form, while the other has 'Mega Blastoise' in its form column. The 2nd one will have its name changed to 'Blastoise-Mega'\n\nIn the future I will plan on including all possible abiliites and what tier they are placed in\n\nI wanted to soften the barrier to entry to competetive pokemon and help those interested in learning more about it. Hope you enjoyed!",
