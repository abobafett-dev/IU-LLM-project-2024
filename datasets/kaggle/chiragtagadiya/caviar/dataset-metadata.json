  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nThis Dataset is  a time-varying criminal network that is repeatedly disturbed by police forces. The CAVIAR investigation lasted two years and ran from 1994 to 1996. The operation brought together investigation units of the Montr\u00e9al police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of Canada. During this two-year period, 11 wiretap warrants, valid for a period of about two months each, were obtained (the 11 matrices contained in phase1.csv, phase2.csv,  correspond to these eleven, two-month wiretap phases).\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis case is interesting because, unlike other investigative strategies, the mandate of the CAVIAR project was to seize the drugs without arresting the perpetrators. During this period, imports of the trafficking network were hit by the police on eleven occasions. The arrests took place only at the end of the investigation. Monetary losses for traffickers were estimated at  32 million dollars. Eleven seizures took place throughout the investigation. Some phases included no seizures, and others included multiple. \n\nThe following summarizes the  seizures:\n\nPhase 4\t   1 seizure\t         $2,500,000\t               300 kg of marijuana\nPhase 6\t   3 seizures\t         $1,300,000\t               2 x 15 kg of marijuana + 1 x 2 kg of cocaine\nPhase 7\t   1 seizure\t         $3,500,000\t               401 kg of marijuana\nPhase 8\t   1 seizure\t         $360,000\t               9 kg of cocaine\nPhase 9\t   2 seizures\t         $4,300,000\t               2 kg of cocaine + 1 x 500 kg marijuana\nPhase 10\t   1 seizure\t         $18,700,000\t               2200 kg of marijuana\nPhase 11\t   2 seizures\t         $1,300,000\t               12 kg of cocaine + 11 kg of cocaine\n\n\nThis case offers a rare opportunity to study a criminal network in upheaval from police forces. This allows us to analyze changes in the network structure and to survey the reaction and adaptation of the participants while they were subjected to an increasing number of distressing constraints.\n\nThe network consists of 110 (numbered) players. Players 1-82 are the traffickers. Players 83-110 are the non-traffickers (financial investors; accountants; owners of various importation businesses, etc.). Initially, the investigation targeted Daniel Serero, the alleged mastermind of a drug network in downtown Montr\u00e9al, who attempted to import marijuana to Canada from Morocco, transiting through Spain. After the first seizure, happening in Phase 4, traffickers reoriented to cocaine import from Colombia, transiting through the United States.\n\nAccording to the police, the role of 23 of the players in the \u201cSerero organization\" are the following, listed by name (unique id):\n\n**Daniel Serero (n1) :** Mastermind of the network.\n\n**Pierre Perlini (n3) :** Principal lieutenant of Serero, he executes Serero's instructions.\n\n**Alain (n83) and G\u00e9rard (n86) Levy :** Investors and transporters of money.\n\n**Wallace Lee (n85) :** Takes care of financial affairs (accountant).\n\n**Gaspard Lino (n6):**  Broker in Spain.\n\n**Samir Rabbat (n11):**  Provider in Morocco.\n\n**Lee Gilbert (n88):** A trusted man of Wallace Lee (became an informer after the arrest).\n\n**Beverly Ashton (n106):**  Spouse of Lino, transports money and documents.\n\n**Antonio Iannacci (n89):** Investor.\n\n**Mohammed Echouafni (n84):**  Moroccan investor.\n\n**Richard Gleeson (n5), Bruno de Quinzio (n8) and Gabrielle Casale (n76) :** Charged with recuperating the marijuana.\n\n**Roderik Janouska (n77):**  Individual with airport contacts.\n\n**Patrick Lee (n87):**  Investor.\n\n**Salvatore Panetta (n82):** Transport arrangements manager.\n\n**Steve Cunha (n96):**  Transport manager, owner of a legitimate import company (became an informer after the arrest).\n\n**Ernesto Morales (n12):**  Principal organizer of the cocaine import, an intermediary between the Colombians and the Serero organization.\n\n**Oscar Nieri (n17):**  The handyman of Morales.\n\n**Richard Brebner (n80):**  Was transporting the cocaine from the US to Montr\u00e9al.\n\n**Ricardo Negrinotti (n33):**  Was taking possession of the cocaine in the US to hand it to Brebner.\n\n**Johnny Pacheco (n16):** Cocaine provider.\n\nIn the data files (phase1.csv, phase2.csv, ), you will find matrices that report the number of wiretapped correspondences between the above players in the network, where players are identified by their unique id. You will be analyzing this time-varying network, giving a rough sketch of its shape, its evolution and the role of the actors in it.\n\n\nYou can also load this dataset directly from the internet (which is slightly more convenient when using Colab) using the following Python code:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport networkx as nx\nphases = {}\nG = {}\nfor i in range(1,12): \n  var_name = \"phase\" + str(i)\n  file_name = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ragini30/Networks-Homework/main/\" + var_name + \".csv\"\n  phases[i] = pd.read_csv(file_name, index_col = [\"players\"])\n  phases[i].columns = \"n\" + phases[i].columns\n  phases[i].index = phases[i].columns\n  G[i] = nx.from_pandas_adjacency(phases[i])\n  G[i].name = var_name\nNote that this code also renames the actors from integer identifiers to strings of the kind \u201cn1\", \u201cn2\" etc, to be more consistent with notation. It then creates networkx graphs from the matrices and stores them in the G dictionary by their phase number.\n\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ragini30/Networks-Homework/main/phase1.csv\nMITx 6.419x Data Analysis: Statistical Modeling and Computation in Applications\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-criminal-network-during-an-internal-struggle-for-a-change-at-the-top-of-the_fig2_309577543\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/figure/Community-detection-of-a-time-varying-criminal-network_fig9_261404728\n\n### Inspiration\nMore complex questions that you might be intrested in.\n\n1.
