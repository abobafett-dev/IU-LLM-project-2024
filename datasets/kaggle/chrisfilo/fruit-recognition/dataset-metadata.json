The images where made with in our lab\u2019s environment under different scenarios which we mention below. We captured all the images on a clear background with resolution of 320\u00d7258 pixels. We used HD Logitech web camera to took the pictures. During collecting this database, we created all kind of challenges, which, we have to face in real-world recognition scenarios in supermarket and fruit shops such as light, shadow, sunshine, pose variation, to make our model robust for, it might be necessary to cope with illumination variation, camera capturing artifacts, specular reflection shading and shadows. We tested our model\u2019s robustness in all scenarios and it perform quit well.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F2102373%2F9e382433fefaae95e3a6ad49490c7a25%2FUntitled.png?generation=1580852087741182&alt=media)\n\n\n## Folder structure\n\nThere are 15 different kind of fruits consisting of 44406 images.
