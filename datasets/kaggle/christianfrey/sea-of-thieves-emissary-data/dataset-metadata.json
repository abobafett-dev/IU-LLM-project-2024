  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\n[Sea of Thieves](https://www.seaofthieves.com/) added a new emissary system on May 1st, 2020. This system gives players the option to join emissaries, unlocking bonuses and cosmetics in return. Players can join as many emissaries as they like, and are not limited to one. When a player joins an emissary, their name is added to their emissary's leader board. The leader board divides all players into even quartiles, ordered by value earned for that emissary. Players are incentivised to reach the top quarter by the end of the month in order to receive the coolest ship cosmetics. The lower ranks also receive less significant rewards. The values and positions are reset at the end of each month. \n\nRare, the developer of Sea of Thieves, published limited information regarding the quarterly ranking [online](https://www.seaofthieves.com/leaderboards). They posted the value, position, and name of the top member of each emissary's quartile. I recorded the values from this page everyday at 5pm EST from May 4th to May 31st 2020, and February 1st to 28th 2021. Since Rare added seasons to Sea of Thieves in February 2021, I decided to update the data to give a comparison of how the emissary system has evolved over the year. Example of how the available data was presented below. \n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F4775998%2F9af1d5d7f82de904b7cbed08c173ae72%2Fsea-of-thieves-top-emissaries-ledger-1024x576.png?generation=1592058208221325&alt=media)\n\n\n\n### Content\n\nEach row contains a date, emissary, level, position, and value. The `Emissary` can be one of the 5 options: Gold Hoarders, Order of Souls, Athena's Fortune, Merchant Alliance, and Reaper's Bones. The `Level` reflects the each quartile ranking, with 4 being the top player's and 1 being to bottom's. `Position` reflects the total number of players better than that level, so 1 is the best player in the world and 200,000 is the 200,000th ranked. `Value` is the currency needed to reach that position within the emissary.
