For more information on the survey (i.e., sampling methods, etc.), please visit [this page](https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm).

The purpose of creating this subset was to simplify moving the dataset around, as well as working with the dataset in general (e.g., less cryptic feature names, etc.) The subset is now offered *as is* to other students, hobbyists, etc. for practice.\n\nThe variables in this data set are substances that survey participants have admitted to using in their past (e.g., cocaine, heroin, meth, etc.), as well as associated risk factors that may influence whether or not an individual engages in drug use (e.g., income bracket, education, sex, etc.). Non-illicit drugs such as alcohol, marijuana*, and pain relief medicine were also of particular interest in the analysis project. Because these substances are often characterized as \u201cgateways\u201d to illicit drug use, it may prove interesting to the analyst to discern how usage of these substances affects the risk of using illicit substances as well. \n",
