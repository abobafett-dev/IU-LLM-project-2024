Goal of this project/images is a very simple binary image classification model for me to do some \"real world learning\": - Dandelions - Anything NOT dandelions :)\n\nInitial thoughts and findings: Need lots and lots more images. While the training results in decent accuracy, the validation loss is substantial. My initial 1,200+ images (50% dandelion/50% not) seems woefully small. May need upwards of 10,000+ of each....maybe. Initially the focus was not on dandelions that have already flowered, but more on just the leaves being the more prominent feature. Next spring/summer, I'll need to diversify the dandelions. I had initially started with 'Square' images to keep it uniform. However, with help from the 'kids,' in the neighborhood I ended up allowing all sizes and shapes. Seems that to get well over 10,000 of each, that's a restriction I'll have to work through.\n\n\n### Content\n\nImages/dandelions = only images of dandelions\nImages/other = other, mostly grass images\nImages/dandelion_v_other = kinda' a mistake this dir gets created during training. Should be cleared out on each training.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nKids in the neighborhood helped take the images...seriously...they're the best. Next spring/summer I'll get more...hopefully thousands more! Credit to laurence maroney and coursera for getting the ball going.\n@jasonbrownlee and his incredible knowledge and talent around teaching ML/AI. https://machinelearningmastery.com/  Thank you!\n\n### Inspiration\nAn incredible (to me) effort in Australia to mitigate weeds in a meaningful way. Perhaps a similar, better-for-the-environment method to remove dandelions might come some day :)\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38343-3\n",
