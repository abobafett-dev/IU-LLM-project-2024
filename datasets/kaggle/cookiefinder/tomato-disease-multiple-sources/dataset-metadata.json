The data has been augmented offline using multiple advanced techniques like image flipping, Gamma correction, noise injection, PCA color augmentation, rotation, and scaling. Some recent images were generated offline with GANs. The subset of images containing Taiwan tomato leaves was augmented using rotations at multiple angles, mirroring, reducing image brightness, etc.",
