  "descriptionNullable": "The complete set of images have been classified among two classes i.e. healthy and diseased. First, the acquired images are classified and labeled conferring to the plants. The plants were named ranging from P0 to P11. Then the entire dataset has been divided among 22 subject categories ranging from 0000 to 0022. The classes labeled with 0000 to 0011 were marked as a healthy class and ranging from 0012 to 0022 were labeled diseased class. This is a collection of about 4503 images of which contains 2278 images of healthy leaf and 2225 images of the diseased leaf. Twelve plants named as Mango, Arjun, Alstonia Scholaris, Guava, Bael, Jamun, Jatropha, Pongamia Pinnata, Basil, Pomegranate, Lemon, and Chinar have been selected. Leaf images of these plants in healthy and diseased condition have been acquired and divided between two separate modules. ",
