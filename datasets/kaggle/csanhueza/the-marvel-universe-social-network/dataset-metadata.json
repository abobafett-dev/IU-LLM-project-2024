In 1961, Marvel relaunched its superhero comic books publishing line. This new era started what has been known as the *Marvel Age of Comics*. Characters created during this period such as Spider-Man, the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men, together with those created during the Golden Age such as Captain America, are known worldwide and have become cultural icons during the last decades.
