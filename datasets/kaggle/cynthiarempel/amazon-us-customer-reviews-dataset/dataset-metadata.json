In a period of over two decades since the first review in 1995, millions of Amazon customers have contributed over a hundred million reviews to express opinions and describe their experiences regarding products on the Amazon.com website. This makes Amazon Customer Reviews a rich source of information for academic researchers in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and Machine Learning (ML), amongst others. Accordingly, we are releasing this data to further research in multiple disciplines related to understanding customer product experiences. Specifically, this dataset was constructed to represent a sample of customer evaluations and opinions, variation in the perception of a product across geographical regions, and promotional intent or bias in reviews.\n\n### Content\n\n* marketplace\n       - 2 letter country code of the marketplace where the review was written.\n* customer_id\n       - Random identifier that can be used to aggregate reviews written by a single author.\n* review_id\n         - The unique ID of the review.\n* product_id\n        - The unique Product ID the review pertains to.
