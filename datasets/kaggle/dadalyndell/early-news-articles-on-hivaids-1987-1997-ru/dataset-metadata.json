The harsh rhetoric used to describe those affected by the disease fuelled fear, discrimination, and misunderstanding, ultimately hindering progress towards effective prevention and treatment. By studying the newspaper clippings from that era, we can gain a deeper understanding of the societal attitudes and prejudices. \n\nPart of this dataset was collected while working on the investigation [\"When values kill. How the Russian Ministry of Health triggered an HIV epidemic\"](https://theins.press/en/society/258334). \n\nThe collage is designed by the author of the dataset and contains pages from the same newspapers that are mentioned.",
