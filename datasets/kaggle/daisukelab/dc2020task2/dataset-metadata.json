Prompt detection of machine anomaly by observing its sounds may be useful for machine condition monitoring._\n&gt;\n&gt; _**The main challenge of this task is to detect unknown anomalous sounds under the condition that only normal sound samples have been provided as training data.** In real-world factories, actual anomalous sounds rarely occur and are highly diverse. Therefore, exhaustive patterns of anomalous sounds are impossible to deliberately make and/or collect. This means we have to detect unknown anomalous sounds that were not observed in the given training data. This point is one of the major differences in premise between ASD for industrial equipment and the past supervised DCASE tasks for detecting defined anomalous sounds such as gunshots or a baby crying._\n&gt; ![image](http://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/268bbc4666654d6e5ef28c449067626fbfee7488/2ad7c/images/tasks/challenge2020/task2_unsupervised_detection_of_anomalous_sounds_for_machine_condition_monitoring_01.png)\n\n## About Dataset\n\nURL: https://zenodo.org/record/3678171#.XnRgCi3AOL4\n\nQuoting description from the dataset website:\n\n&gt; _The data used for this task comprises parts of [ToyADMOS](https://zenodo.org/record/3351307#.XnRgPC3AOL4) and the [MIMII](https://zenodo.org/record/3384388#.XnRgWi3AOL4) Dataset consisting of the normal/anomalous operating sounds of six types of toy/real machines.
