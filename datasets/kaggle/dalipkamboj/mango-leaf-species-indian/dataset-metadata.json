These usually feature such as texture, shape, and color. With these features that different mangoes verities, it is possible to classify. The dataset contains 768 images of 32 Mango Leaf Species (Indian) and each species has 24 images from different angles and orientations.

Models were created by using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for the image dataset and the classification successes from the models were achieved 99.09%. The provided dataset can be considered as a benchmark for testing and comparing the performance of different algorithms.",
