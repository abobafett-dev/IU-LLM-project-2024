  "descriptionNullable": "# Context\n\nIn October 2021 the World Health Organization (WHO) published an article about how Mental Health services have been pushed to the limit during the COVID-19 pandemic while stating that the next pandemic will be on mental health encouraging governments to increase their expenditure on Mental Health.\n\nWhile searching for Mental Health service usage and expenditure in New Zealand we found that the information is spread in several excel spreadsheets from 2002 to 2020 with different sources, formats, and accessibility. \n\nWe then proceeded to gather some of the information provided by the New Zealand Ministry of health into 3 datasets that \nsummarise the usage of these services in the last 20 years.\n\n# Inspiration\n\nThe main inspiration for this dataset was to find a way of building a continuous pipeline for future reference of Mental Health Service usage in New Zealand.\n\nOur first approach was to match Government Expenditure and usage of Mental Health Services in NZ over the last years but finding information about specific government expenditure is hard to come by, So we decided to focus mostly in creating a solid dataframe about mental health service usage over the years.\n\n\n# Data Sources\n\n[Ministry of Health New Zealand](https://www.health.govt.nz)\n\nThis data source was chosen for its ease of access and ability to web scrape.\n\nDatasets were available from three sources:\n1) Datasets from 2002 to 2008\n2) Dataset of 2010\n3) Dataset from 2011 to 2020\n\n3 different crawlers were developed in order to maintain consistency over sources.\nDatasets from 2011 onwards are displayed in the ministry of health new [Aggregated Data Site.](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/mental-health-and-addiction/mental-health-and-addiction-monitoring-reporting-and-data). \n\nDatasets from 2002 were gathered from legacy sources on the list of reports by the [ministry of health](https://www.health.govt.nz/nz-health-statistics/health-statistics-and-data-sets/mental-health-data-and-stats?mega=Health%20statistics&title=Mental%20health)\n\n\nThe data provided in this data sets can be classified into 3 groups:\n\n1) **NZ Mental Health services usage by gender, age and ethnicity.**\n2) **NZ Mental Health service usage by DHB's (District Health boards)**\n3) **NZ Metal Health service usage by Service provided.**\n\n\"Data is sourced from the Programme for the Integration of Mental Health Data (PRIMHD). PRIMHD contains Ministry of Health funded mental health and addiction service activity and outcomes data.
