It contains 4*32560 = 130240 training and 3960 evaluation samples. Each training sample provides:\n-\tRGB image (224x224 pixels)\n-\tHand segmentation mask (224x224 pixels)\n-\tIntrinsic camera matrix K\n-\tHand scale (metric length of a reference bone)\n-\t3D keypoint annotation for 21 Hand Keypoints\n-\t3D shape annotation\nThe training set contains 32560 unique samples post processed in 4 different ways to remove the green screen background. Each evaluation sample provides an RGB image, Hand scale and intrinsic camera matrix. The keypoint and shape annotation is withhold and scoring of algorithms is handled through our Codalab evaluation server.
