  "descriptionNullable": "**Content**\nUnderstanding the sentiment of a comment from a video or an image is an essential task in many applications. Sentiment analysis of a text can be helpful in various decision-making processes. One such application is to analyze the popular sentiments of videos on social media based on viewer comments. However, comments from social media do not follow strict rules of grammar, and they contain a mixture of more than one language, often written in non-native scripts. Non-availability of annotated code-mixed data for a low-resourced language like Tamil also adds difficulty to this problem. To overcome this, we created a gold standard Tamil-English code-switched, sentiment-annotated corpus containing 15,744 comment posts from YouTube. This paper describes the process of creating the corpus and assigning polarities. We present inter-annotator agreement and show the results of sentiment analyses trained on this corpus as a benchmark.\n\nThis dataset consists of two classes +ve and -ve comments in Tamil-English which means Tamil words in English alphabets.\n\nA Tamil-English text dataset is a collection of text data that contains both Tamil and English language content. This type of dataset is typically used for natural language processing tasks that involve working with multilingual data, such as machine translation, text classification, or language modeling.\n\nThe Tamil-English text dataset may include a variety of different types of text data, such as news articles, books, social media posts, or other types of written or spoken language. The dataset may also be organized in a variety of ways, such as by topic, genre, or source, depending on the specific use case.\n\nThe Tamil-English text dataset may also include additional annotations or metadata, such as part-of-speech tags, named entity labels, or other information that is relevant to the specific natural language processing tasks that the dataset is intended to support.\n\nOverall, a Tamil-English text dataset is a valuable resource for anyone working with multilingual natural language data, and can be used for a variety of different tasks and applications.\n\n\n\n",
