To download full dataset or to submit a request for your new data collection needs, please drop a mail to:&nbsp;[sales@datacluster.ai](mailto:sales@datacluster.ai)**\n\nThis dataset is an extremely challenging set of over 1,000+ images of electric vehicle number plate (India) in the wild. These images are captured using our crowdsourcing platform from over 2000+ different locations, where each image is **manually reviewed and verified** by our computer vision professionals at Datacluster Labs. It contains a wide variety number plates which are green in color, i.e. electric vehicles in India.\n\n### **Dataset Features**\n\n- Dataset size : 1000+ images\n- Captured by  : Over 600+ crowdsource contributors\n- Resolution   : HD and above (1920x1080 and above)\n- Location     : Captured with 600+ locations \n- Diversity    : Various lighting conditions,varied distances, view points etc.\n- Device used  : Captured using mobile phones \n- Usage \t   : Electic vehile number plate, automated number plate recoginition, OCR, etc.\n\n### Available Annotation formats\n\nCOCO, YOLO, PASCAL-VOC, Tf-Record\n\n**The images in this dataset are exclusively owned by Data Cluster Labs and were not downloaded from the internet.
