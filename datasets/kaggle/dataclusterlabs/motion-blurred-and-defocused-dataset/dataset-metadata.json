Images were captured under wide variety of lighting conditions, weather, indoor and outdoor. This dataset can be used for Image De-noising, Deblurring and noise removal algorithms. This can be also work as robust test set for denoising algorithms.\n\n### **Dataset Features**\n- Captured by 3000+ unique users\n- Rich in diversity\n- Mobile phone view point\n- HD Resolution\n- Various lighting conditions\n- Indoor and Outdoor scene\n\n### **Dataset Features**\n- Classification and detection annotations available\n- Multiple category annotations possible\n- COCO, PASCAL VOC and YOLO formats\n\n**The images in this dataset are exclusively owned by Data Cluster Labs and were not downloaded from the internet. To access a larger portion of the training dataset for research and commercial purposes, a license can be purchased.
