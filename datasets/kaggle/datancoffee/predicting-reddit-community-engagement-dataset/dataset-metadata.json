It was used for analyzing the impact of news content, author, and publication domain on Subreddit selection by Reddit posters as well as for predicting engagement stats such as the popularity score and number of commenters.\n\nThe dataset aggregates data from the following 2 BigQuery datasets:\n\n - [GDELT BigQuery][6] dataset \n - [Reddit BigQuery][7] dataset\n\nIt is also available as a [BigQuery dataset][8]. \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank: \n\n - Kalev Leetaru from GDELT, a global news data repository. \n - [Nick Caldwell][9] from Reddit\n - [Jason Baumgartner][10] from pushshift.io, the source for Reddit data \n - [Felipe Hoffa][11], a developer advocate at Google\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThis dataset, and the related Kaggle [kernel][12], attempts to answer the question: \"What drives community engagement with current events on the world's largest online discussion site - Reddit?\"\n\nOur most accurate model for classifying news articles according to interests of the Reddit user community was a multi-label model that used publishing domains and GDELT entities as predictors. We also developed an anomaly detection model (with a 92% top 5 accuracy) that can be used for validating whether a posting to a subreddit fits already seen behavior or constitutes a new trend or potentially an anomaly. We were also surprised to learn that once an article is posted to Reddit, its popularity and community engagement will depend on who posted the article to Reddit, and which subreddit it landed at, but not its content.\n\n\n  [1]: https://medium.com/@datancoffee\n  [2]: https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2018/03/predicting-community-engagement-on-reddit-using-tensorflow-gdelt-and-cloud-dataflow-part-1\n  [3]: https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2018/03/predicting-community-engagement-on-reddit-using-tensorflow-gdelt-and-cloud-dataflow-part-2\n  [4]: https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2018/03/predicting-community-engagement-on-reddit-using-tensorflow-gdelt-and-cloud-dataflow-part-3\n  [5]: https://github.com/datancoffee/sirocco\n  [6]: https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/gdelt-bq:gdeltv2\n  [7]: https://pushshift.io/using-bigquery-with-reddit-data/\n  [8]: https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/datancoffee:discussion_opinions\n  [9]: https://twitter.com/nickcald\n  [10]: https://twitter.com/jasonbaumgartne\n  [11]: https://twitter.com/felipehoffa\n  [12]: https://www.kaggle.com/datancoffee/predicting-community-engagement-on-reddit/",
