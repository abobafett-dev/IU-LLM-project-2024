For each game, there are fields for:\n\n - Game ID\n - Creation Time (in Epoch format)\n - Game Duration (in seconds)\n - Season ID\n - Winner (1 = team1,   2 = team2)\n - First Baron, dragon, tower, blood, inhibitor and Rift Herald (1 = team1,   2 = team2, 0 = none)\n - Champions and summoner spells for each team (Stored as Riot's champion and summoner spell IDs)\n - The number of tower, inhibitor, Baron, dragon and Rift Herald kills each team has\n - The 5 bans of each team (Again, champion IDs are used)\n\nThis dataset was collected using the Riot Games API, which makes it easy to lookup and collect information on a users ranked history and collect their games. However finding a list of usernames is the hard part, in this case I am using a list of usernames scraped from 3rd party LoL sites.\n\nPossible Uses\n-------------\n\nThere is a vast amount of data in just a single LoL game. This dataset takes the most relevant information and makes it available easily for use in things such as attempting to predict the outcome of a LoL game, analysing which in-game events are most likely to lead to victory, understanding how big of an effect bans of a specific champion have, and more.",
