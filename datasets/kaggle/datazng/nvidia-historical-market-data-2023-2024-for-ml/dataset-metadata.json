Simple Linear Regression\n2. Multiple Linear Regression\n3. Multivariate Regression Test\n4. PCA \n5. Factor Analysis\n6. ARIMA\n\nThe key idea is to utilize historical stock market dataset to predict Next Day adjusted close price by using various variables. The predictive power and importance of each variable will be evaluated using PCA and VIF score.\n\nThe project aims to figure out the feasibility to predict stock market adjusted closing price for the trendy AI stock NVIDIA and filter out the most important indicator of stock price prediction.\n\nFeatures included in this dataset:\n\n- Predictive Variable: Next Day Adjusted Close price \n- Independent Variables and its Types\n\n1.
