Each file contains the attributes of the entity and the IDs that can be used to join them together.\n\n![diagram](https://github.com/dcaribou/transfermarkt-datasets/blob/master/resources/diagram.svg?raw=true)\n\nFor example, the `appearances` file contains **one row per player appearance**, i.e. one row per player per game played. For each appearance you will find attributes such as `goals`, `assists` or `yellow_cards` and IDs referencing other entities within the dataset, such as `player_id` and `game_id`.\n&gt; **Idea:** Chekout the mate [data.world project Football Data from Transfermarkt](https://data.world/dcereijo/player-scores-demo) for examples of how to use the resources in this dataset to create different types of analysis.\n\n### How did we build it?\nThe source code that maintains this dataset, as well as the data pipeline, [is available in Github](https://github.com/dcaribou/transfermarkt-datasets). On a high level, the project uses [transfermarkt-scraper](https://github.com/dcaribou/transfermarkt-scraper) to pull the data from [Transfermark website](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/) and a set of Python scripts and SQL to curate it and publish it here.\n\n&gt; **Idea:** Watch the [`transfermarkt-datasets` Github repository](https://github.com/dcaribou/transfermarkt-datasets) for updates on improvements and bugfixes on this dataset\n\n### What is the status?\nThis dataset is a live project subject to regular updates and new enhancements. The best way to find out about the different initiatives within this project and their status is to check the `Issues` section on [transfermarkt-datasets](https://github.com/dcaribou/transfermarkt-datasets/issues).\n\n### Contact\nThe source of truth for the code and data for this project is Github and that is the best place to start a conversation, please checkout the community guidelines [here](https://github.com/dcaribou/transfermarkt-datasets/discussions/179).\n\n&gt; If you have a github user I kindly ask that you post your questions there and not in the __Discussion__ tab in this website.\n",
