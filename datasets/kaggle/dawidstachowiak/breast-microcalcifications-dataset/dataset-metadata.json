Specifically, this dataset includes the prior and recent mammograms of CC and MLO view of each patient. This is a complete dataset for the detection and BI-RADS classification of breast micro-calcifications, using digital mammograms. It contains normal (BI-RADS 1), benign (BI-RADS 2), and suspicious (BI-RADS 4-5) cases, and for each mammogram, an image with precise annotation of each individual micro-calcification, by two expert radiologists, is provided. In 32 suspicious cases, the biopsy results are also available.\n\n\n**Citing the Dataset**\n\nThe dataset is released under a Creative Commons Attribution license, so please cite the dataset if it is used in your work in any form.
