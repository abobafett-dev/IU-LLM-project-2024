This dataset is split into training, validation, and test folders which contain 4000 (~84%), 385 (~8%), and 385 (~8%) fundus images in each class respectively. Each training set has a folder for each class: referable glaucoma (RG) and non-referable glaucoma (NRG). *This dataset is designed to easily benchmark your glaucoma classification models in Kaggle. Please make a contribution in the code tab, I have created a template to make it even easier!*\n\n**Please cite the dataset and at least the first of my related works if you found this dataset useful!**\n\n- Riley Kiefer. \"EyePACS-AIROGS-light-V2\".

This method yields more of the actual fundus foreground in the resultant image.\n- Increased the image resize dimensions from 256x256 pixels to 512x512 pixels\n - Reason: Provides greater model input flexibility, detail, and size. This also better supports the ONH-cropping models.\n- Added 3000 images from the Rotterdam EyePACS AIROGS dev set\n - Reason: More data samples can improve model generalizability\n- Readjusted train/val/test split\n - Reason: The validation and test split sizes were different\n- Improved sampling from source dataset\n - Reason: v1 NRG samples were not randomly selected\n\n**Drawbacks of Rotterdam EyePACS AIROGS:**\nOne of the largest drawbacks of the original dataset is the accessibility of the dataset. The dataset requires a long download, a large storage space, it spans several folders, and it is not machine-learning-ready (it requires data processing and splitting). The dataset also contains raw fundus images in their original dimensions; these original images often contain a large amount of black background and the dimensions are too large for machine learning inputs. The proposed dataset addresses the aforementioned concerns by image sampling and image standardization to balance and reduce the dataset size respectively.\n\n**Origin:**\nThe images in this dataset are sourced from the Rotterdam EyePACS AIROGS [1] dataset, which contains 113,893 color fundus images from 60,357 subjects and approximately 500 different sites with a heterogeneous ethnicity; this impressive dataset is over 60GB when compressed. The first lightweight version of the dataset is known as EyePACS-AIROGS-light (v1) [2]. \n\n**About Me:**\nI have studied glaucoma-related research for my computer science master's thesis.
