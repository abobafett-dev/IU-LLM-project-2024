Communication can be either be in written, pictorial or oral format. But there is very less communication between those who use sign language as their primary means of communication. To lessen up the communication gap between Sign language users and non-Sign language users, this dataset might be beneficial for research and application purposes.\n\n\n**Content**\nThe Dataset has been broadly classified into Training and Testing Data. Training Data has been classified and segregated into 29 classes, of which 26 alphabets A-Z and 3 other classes of SPACE, DELETE, NOTHING. The test data set contains a mere 29 images, to encourage the use of real-world test images.\n\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nWe would thank every open dataset which helped in pooling a large dataset.\n\n**Inspiration**\n\nHoping to lessen the communication gap by implementing research based projects and application.\ud83d\udcaa ",
