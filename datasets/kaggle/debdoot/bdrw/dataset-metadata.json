  "descriptionNullable": "**Context:** BDRW is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and vision algorithms with minimal requirement on data pre-processing and formatting to identify digits of the decimal number system appearing in Bengali script. It can be seen as similar in flavor to SVHN (e.g., the images are of small cropped digits), but incorporates higher visual heterogeneity and comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). BDRW is obtained from numbers appearing in photographs, printed materials, sign boards, wall writings, calendar or book pages, etc.\n\n**File:** BDRW_train.zip (contains BDRW_train_1.zip, BDRW_train_2.zip)\n\nThe data in the two zip files are to be used together and together contain a set of .jpg images of different sized which are cropped from different photographs, magazine prints, wall writing images, etc. Each image represents a digit from the decimal number system written in Bengali (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_numerals). The file labels.xls contains the number represented in each image which can be used as the ground truth labels for training a learning based system to recognize the Bengali numbers.\n\n**Inspiration:** This dataset is released for a machine vision challenge being hosted at IEEE TechSym 2016. The challenge will also include a testing set which includes samples not present in the training set released here and would be released after the challenge is closed.",
