  "descriptionNullable": "DESCRIPTION\n\nA banking institution requires actionable insights into mortgage-backed securities, geographic business investment, and real estate analysis. \nThe mortgage bank would like to identify potential monthly mortgage expenses for each region based on monthly family income and rental of the real estate.\nA statistical model needs to be created to predict the potential demand in dollars amount of loan for each of the region in the USA. Also, there is a need to create a dashboard which would refresh periodically post data retrieval from the agencies.\nThe dashboard must demonstrate relationships and trends for the key metrics as follows: number of loans, average rental income, monthly mortgage and owner\u2019s cost, family income vs mortgage cost comparison across different regions. The metrics described here do not limit the dashboard to these few.\nDataset Description\n\n \n\nVariables\n\nDescription\nSecond mortgage\tHouseholds with a second mortgage statistics\nHome equity\tHouseholds with a home equity loan statistics\nDebt\tHouseholds with any type of debt statistics\nMortgage Costs\tStatistics regarding mortgage payments, home equity loans, utilities, and property taxes\nHome Owner Costs\tSum of utilities, and property taxes statistics\nGross Rent\tContract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utility features\nHigh school Graduation\tHigh school graduation statistics\nPopulation Demographics\tPopulation demographics statistics\nAge Demographics\tAge demographic statistics\nHousehold Income\tTotal income of people residing in the household\nFamily Income\tTotal income of people related to the householder\nProject Task: Week 1\n\nData Import and Preparation:\n\nImport data. \n\nFigure out the primary key and look for the requirement of indexing.\n\nGauge the fill rate of the variables and devise plans for missing value treatment. Please explain explicitly the reason for the treatment chosen for each variable.\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n\nPerform debt analysis. You may take the following steps:\n\nExplore the top 2,500 locations where the percentage of households with a second mortgage is the highest and percent ownership is above 10 percent. Visualize using geo-map. You may keep the upper limit for the percent of households with a second mortgage to 50 percent\n\nUse the following bad debt equation:\n\nBad Debt = P (Second Mortgage \u2229 Home Equity Loan)\nBad Debt = second_mortgage + home_equity - home_equity_second_mortgage\nCreate pie charts  to show overall debt and bad debt\n\nCreate Box and whisker plot and analyze the distribution for 2nd mortgage, home equity, good debt, and bad debt for different cities\n\nCreate a collated income distribution chart for family income, house hold income, and remaining income\n\nPerform EDA and come out with insights into population density and age. You may have to derive new fields (make sure to weight averages for accurate measurements): \n\nUse pop and ALand variables to create a new field called population density\n\nUse male_age_median, female_age_median, male_pop, and female_pop to create a new field called median age\n\nVisualize the findings using appropriate chart type\n\nCreate bins for population into a new variable by selecting appropriate class interval so that the number of categories don\u2019t exceed 5 for the ease of analysis.\n\nAnalyze the married, separated, and divorced population for these population brackets\n\nVisualize using appropriate chart type\n\nPlease detail your observations for rent as a percentage of income at an overall level, and for different states.\n\nPerform correlation analysis for all the relevant variables by creating a heatmap. Describe your findings.\n\n \n\nProject Task: Week 2\n\nData Pre-processing:\n\nThe economic multivariate data has a significant number of measured variables. The goal is to find where the measured variables depend on a number of smaller unobserved common factors or latent variables. \n\nEach variable is assumed to be dependent upon a linear combination of the common factors, and the coefficients are known as loadings. Each measured variable also includes a component due to independent random variability, known as \u201cspecific variance\u201d because it is specific to one variable. Obtain the common factors and then plot the loadings. Use factor analysis to find latent variables in our dataset and gain insight into the linear relationships in the data. \n\n       Following are the list of latent variables:\n\nHighschool graduation rates\n\nMedian population age\n\nSecond mortgage statistics\n\nPercent own\n\nBad debt expense\n\n \n\nData Modeling :\n\nBuild a linear Regression model to predict the total monthly expenditure for home mortgages loan. \n\n       Please refer deplotment_RE.xlsx.
