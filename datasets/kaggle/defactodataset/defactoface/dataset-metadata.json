To do this, the first need is to be able to rely on reliable and controlled data sets representing the most characteristic cases encountered. The purpose of this work is to lay the foundations of a body of tests allowing both the qualification of automatic methods of authentication and detection of manipulations and the training of these methods.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains about 40000 face morphing and 40000 face swapping forgeries are available under the face morphing directory.
