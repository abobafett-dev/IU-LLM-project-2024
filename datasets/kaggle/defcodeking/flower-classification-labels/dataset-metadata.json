You have to obtain the human-friendly names from the [Getting Started Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/mgornergoogle/getting-started-with-100-flowers-on-tpu/) for the competition, where they are available as a list in a code cell.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset is a ready-to-use CSV version of that list.
