We write a simple script to copy all the files for one artist into one dedicated folder.\n* Then we create the train and validation sets, with 400 train images and 100 validation images respectively for each of the 10 artists.\n* For anyone looking to replicate the dataset creation process, downloading the images from Wikiart, and then replacing the local directory references in the two scripts in create_dataset/ will suffice.
