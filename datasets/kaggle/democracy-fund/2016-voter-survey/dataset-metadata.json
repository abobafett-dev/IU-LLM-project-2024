  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\n[The Democracy Fund Voter Study Group](https://www.voterstudygroup.org/about) is using a unique longitudinal data set that most recently surveyed 8,000 adults (age 18+) in December 2016 via\u00a0[YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/). Participants were identified from a pool of respondents who participated in a similar survey in December 2011, as well as a second pre-election interview in 2012, and a third interview following the 2012 presidential election. For these 8,000 respondents, we have measures of their political attitudes, values, and affinities in 2011 as well as self-reports of their turnout and vote choice in November 2012.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe VOTER (Views of the Electorate Research) Survey was conducted by the survey firm [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/). In total, 8,000 adults (age 18+) with internet access took the survey online between November 29 and December 29, 2016. The estimated margin of error is plus or minus 2.2 percent. YouGov also supplied measures of primary voting behavior from the end of the primary period (July 2016), when these respondents had been contacted as part of a different survey project. \n\nThese respondents were originally interviewed by YouGov in 2011 to 2012 as part of the 2012 Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project (CCAP). In that survey, 45,000 respondents were first interviewed in December 2011 and were interviewed a second time in one of the 45 weekly surveys between January 1 and November 8, 2012. After the November election, 35,408 respondents were interviewed a third time. We invited 11,168 panelists from the 2012 CCAP. Of those invited, 8,637 (77 percent) completed the 2016 VOTER Survey. \n\nThe 2012 CCAP was constructed using YouGov\u2019s sample matching procedure. A stratified sample is drawn from YouGov\u2019s panel, which consists of people who have agreed to take occasional surveys. The strata are defined by the combination of age, gender, race, and education, and each stratum is sampled in proportion to its size in the U.S. population. Then, each element of this sample is matched to a synthetic sampling frame that is constructed from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey, the Current Population Survey Voting and Registration Supplement, and other databases. The matching procedure finds the observation in the sample from YouGov\u2019s panel that most closely matches each observation in the synthetic sampling frame on a set of demographic characteristics. The resulting sample is then weighted by a set of demographic and non-demographic variables. \n\nInformation on variables can be found in the [\"Guide to the 2016 Voter Survey\"](https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publications/2016-elections/data) and included in the dataset.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n[The Democracy Fund](http://www.democracyfund.org/), a charitable foundation committed to the protection and enhancement of democratic values, found the rise of these movements and candidates worthy of analysis. In May 2016, the Democracy Fund chose to begin a rigorous project that would supply hard data to test proposed theories to explain these phenomenon.
