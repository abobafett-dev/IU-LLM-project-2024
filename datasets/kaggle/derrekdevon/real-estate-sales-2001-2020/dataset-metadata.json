That is, the year the property was bought.\n\nTown: The town where this property is located.\n\nAddress: The property's address.\n\nAssessed Value: How much the property is generally considered to be worth.\n\nSale Amount: How much the property was actually sold for.\n\nSales Ratio: The ratio measures how close the selling price of the property is to it's assessed value.\n\nProperty Type: What kind of property it is.\n\nResidential Type: If it is a residential property, what type is it.\n\nYears until sold: Number of years before the property was finally sold\n\n\nThis dataset can be used for analysis and even machine learning projects. For those doing analysis, I invite you to try and answer these questions: \n* Average assessed value of properties from year to year?\n* Average sale amount of properties from year to year? \n* Average sales ratio of properties from year to year? \n* How long, on average, did it take for the different property types to get sold? \n* How long, on average, did it take for the different residential types to get sold? \n* Which towns saw the most property sales in 2021? \n\nFor those more interested in using this dataset in machine learning projects to forecast future property prices, I invite you also. Let's learn from your work.\n",
