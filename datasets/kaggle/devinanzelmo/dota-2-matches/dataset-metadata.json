If anyone creates other dota datasets I can link here, or if anyone interested in updating this datasets let me know. \n\n### Overview\n\nThis dataset contains 50000 ranked ladder matches from the Dota 2 data dump created by Opendota. It was inspired by \nthe [Dota 2 Matches](https://www.kaggle.com/jraramirez/dota-2-matches-dataset) data published here by Joe Ramir. This is an update and improved version of that dataset. I have kept the same image and a similar title.\n\n Dota 2 is a popular MOBA available as free to play, and can take up thousands of hours of your life.  The number of games in this dataset are played about every hour. If you like the data there are an additional 2-3 million matches easily available for download. \n\nThe aim of this dataset is to enable the exploration of player behavior, skill estimation, or anything you find interesting. The intent is to create an accessible, and easy to use resource, which can be expanded and modified if needed.  As such I am open to a wide variety of suggestions as to what additions or changes to make. \n\n### Help getting started\n\nIf there is some aspect of this data you would like to explore but seems difficult to get figure out how to work with please feel free to request some starter code in one of the following two Kernels discussion section. I usually check kaggle every day or so. If you post a request about the current data I will try to get something working. \n\nPython\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/devinanzelmo/d/devinanzelmo/dota-2-matches/misc-howtos-dota-requests-welcome/\n\nR\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/devinanzelmo/d/devinanzelmo/dota-2-matches/howtos-request-welcome/\n\n### Whats Currently Available\n\nSee https://github.com/odota/core/wiki/JSON-Data-Dump for documentaion on data. I have found a few undocumented areas in the data, including the `objectives` information. `player_slot` can be used to combine most of the data, and it is available in most of the tables. Additionally all tables include `match_id`, and some have `account_id` to make it easier to look at an individual players matches. `match_id`, and `account_id` have been reencoded to save a little space. I can upload tables to allow conversion if needed. \n\n - *matches*: contains top level information about each match. \nsee https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/WebAPI/GetMatchDetails#Tower_Status%22tower_status_dire%22:%202047) for interpreting tower and barracks status. Cluster can link matches to geographic region. \n\n - *players*:  Individual players are identified by `account_id` but there is an option to play anonymously and roughly one third of the `account_id` are not available. Anonymous users have the value of `0` for `account_id`. Contains totals for kills, deaths, denies, etc.  Player action counts are available, and are indicated by variable names beginning with `unit_order_`.  Counts for reasons for acquiring or losing gold, and gaining experience, have prefixes `gold_`, and `xp_`. \n\n - *player\\_time*: Contains last hits, experience, and gold sampled at one minute interval for all players in all matches. The column names indicate the player_slot.  For instance `xp_t_1` indicates that this column has experience sums for the player in slot one.\n\n - *teamfights*:  Start and stop time of teamfights, as well as last death time.  Teamfights appear to be all battles  with three or more deaths. As such this does not include all battles for the entire match.\n\n - *teamfights\\_players* :  Additional information provided for each player in each teamfight. `player_slot` can be  used to link this back to `players.csv`\n\n - *objectives*:  Gives information on all the objectives completed, by which player and at what time.\n - *chat*:  All chat for the 50k matches. There is plenty of profanity, and good natured trolling. \n\n - *test\\_labels*: match_id and radiant_win(as integer 1 or 0) \n \n - *test\\_player*: full player and match table with hero_id, player_slot, match_id, and account_id \n\n\n**Nov 5th Update**\n\nAdded several additional tables. None of the previously uploaded data was altered. I plan to add several Kernels in the next week going over how to use the data, and performing some EDA. Many improvements to the player rating method I used are possible for those interested in MMR. \n\n - *player\\_ratings* contains match counts,  win counts, and TrueSkill rating, calculated on 900k matches which occurred prior to other uploaded data. trueskill ratings have two components, `mu`, which can be interpreted as the skill, with higher value being better, and `sigma` which is the uncertainty of the rating. \n - *match\\_outcomes* data for ~900k matches used to calculate player ratings. Use this to improve on the ratings I uploaded.\n - *purchase\\_log* item purchase times\n - *ability\\_upgrade* ability upgrade times and levels\n - *cluster\\_region* allows the mapping cluster found in `match.csv` to geographic region.\n - *patch\\_dates* release dates for various patches, use `start_time` from `match.csv` to determine which patch a match was played in. \n - *ability\\_ids* use with `ability_upgrades.csv` to get the names of upgraded abilities\n - *item\\_ids* use with `purchase_log.csv` to get the names of purchased items\n\n[Kernel showing how player skill was computed][1]: Contains several resources on trueskill rating system.\n\n### Past Research\n\nThere seem to be some efforts to establish indicators for skillfull play based on specific parts of gameplay. Opendota has many statistics, and some analysis for specific benchmarks at different times in the game. Dotabuff has a lot of information I have not explored it deeply. This is an area to gather more information.  \n\n### Some possible directions of investigation\n\nInsight from domain experts would also be useful to help clarify what problems are interesting to work on. Some initial task ideas\n\n - Predict match outcomes based on aggregates for individual players using only account_id as prior information\n - Add hero id to this and see if there is a differences in performance\n - Estimate player skill based on a sample of in game play(this might need an external mmr source or different definition skill)\n - Create improved indicators of skillful play based game actions to help players target areas for improvement\n\nAll of these areas have been worked on, but I am not aware of the most up to date research on dota2 gameplay.\n\nI plan on setting up several different predictive tasks in the upcoming weeks. A test set of an additional 50 to 100 thousand matches with just hero_id, and account_id included along with outcome of the match. \n\nThe current dataset seems pretty small for modeling individual players. I would prefer to have a wide range of features instead of a larger dataset for the moment.  \n\n*Dataset idea* for anyone interested in creating their own Dota 2 dataset. It would be useful to have a few full matches available to work on. They would need to be extracted from the .dem replay file to something easily parsed by R and Python as available in kernels. Given the size of a full match data only a few matches would be needed.  There are files available from opendota' s website(check for replays).  Looking at fine grained match details would potentially allow for the creation of better high level parsed data. I think it would be a lot of work just to get a handle on working with full match data so a sample would be good to have. \n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n[Orginal kaggle dataset on dota2 matches by Joe Ramir](https://www.kaggle.com/jraramirez/dota-2-matches-dataset)\nI also borrowed the image and some of the content for these acknowledgements from the above, thanks!.\n\n[image source](http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/blogfiles/keyart_ezalor.jpg)\n\n[Data download source](http://academictorrents.com/details/5c5deeb6cfe1c944044367d2e7465fd8bd2f4acf) created by yasp\n    \nDescription of original dataset creation: https://github.com/yasp-dota/yasp/issues/924\n\nyasp's license\n\n\"License: CC BY-SA 4.0\"\n\n\"Terms: We ask that you attribute yasp.co if you create or publish anything related to our data.
