After ending that assignment I came up with the idea to integrate these matches' data with the players' data that have played in each of these matches. When I found a website that hosted this data I tried and web scraped all the data possible including those cricketers who have even not played in the matches of which I had the data.\n\n\n### Content\n\nI collected the data by web scraping the website [Cricket Country](https://www.cricketcountry.com.) The website provided extensive data about many cricketers. I processed the data to remove noise and the final dataset has full name along with place, country, date of birth of the players, the teams for which they have played and the batting/bowling style.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI owe thanks to the website owners for hosting such extensive data.\n",
