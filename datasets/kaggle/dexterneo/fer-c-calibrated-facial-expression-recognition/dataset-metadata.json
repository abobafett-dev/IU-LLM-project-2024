  "descriptionNullable": "While prior works have mainly focused on identifying affective states, we find that models in facial expression recognition are uncalibrated. This is particularly true when out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts further exacerbate the uncertainty of facial expressions. While most OOD benchmarks provide hard labels, we argue that labels for evaluating FER models should be soft in order to better reflect the ambiguity of facial expressions. Our framework proposes soft labels that closely approximate the average information loss based on different types of OOD shifts.",
