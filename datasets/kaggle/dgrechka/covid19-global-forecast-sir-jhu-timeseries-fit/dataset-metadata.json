It contains parameters for the [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model) for different locations worldwide.\n\nThe model is defined as ODE system as follows:\n![SIR ODE equations](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/29728a7d4bebe8197dca7d873d81b9dce954522e)\n\nThe models are fitted on[ John Hopkins University data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) (time series) using several runs of Nelder-Mead simplex optimization method (best run is taken) starting at different initial locations and RMSE as a loss.\n\n What parameters are fitted (estimated) per country/province:\n* the day when the infection emerged in the country\n* the initial infected count on the first day of the infection\n* beta - an average number of contacts (sufficient to spread the disease) per day each infected individual has\n* gamma - fixed fraction of the infected group that will recover during any given day\n* R0 - how many susceptible people are infected (on average) by single infected individual.
