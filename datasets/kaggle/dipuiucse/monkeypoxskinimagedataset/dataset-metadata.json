It is essential to have an early diagnosis in order to slow down its rapid progression. For this purpose, we have created a new skin image-based dataset for the detection of monkeypox disease. This dataset consists of four classes: Monkeypox, Chickenpox, Measles, and Normal. All the image classes are collected from internet-based sources.
