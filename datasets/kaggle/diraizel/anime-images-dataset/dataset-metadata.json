Please note that you might need to clean the image directories a bit, since the images might contain merchandise and live-action photos in addition to the actual anime itself.\n\n## Scripts\nIf you'd like to take a look at the scripts used to make this dataset, you can find them on this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Etrama/anime-image-scraper).  \nFeel free to extend it, scrape your own images, etc. etc.  \n\n## Inspiration\nAs a big anime fan, I found a lot of anime related datasets on Kaggle. I was however disappointed to find no dataset containing anime specific images for popular anime. Some other great datasets that I've been inspired by include:\n- [Top 250 Anime 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gianinamariapetrascu/top-250-anime-2023)\n- [Anime Recommendations Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database)\n- [Anime Recommendation Database 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020)\n- [Anime Face Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset)\n- [Safebooru - Anime Image Metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alamson/safebooru)\n\n## Process\n1. You need a list of anime to scrape it. You can either:\n  - Make your own list. This is what I do in the directory called \"scraped_anime_list\".\n  - Use someone else's list. This is what I do in the directory called \"kaggle_anime_list\" and \"top_anime_list\".\n2. To be honest, I wanted to make my own list. To make a list of anime, I used the python wrapper of the unofficial MAL (MyAnimeList) API called [JikanPy](https://github.com/abhinavk99/jikanpy). JikanPy scraped MAL. \n3. Animes on MAL have a unique identifier called anime id, think of this as a unique number for each anime. This is supposed to be sequential but there are a lot of gaps from valid anime id to the next, which I discovered based on this [post](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=2000753).\n4. These IDs can go from 1 - 100,000 and maybe beyond. However, I decided to go through the anime ids one by one from 1-50,000 and retrive the **id**, **rank** and **anime_name**. This is what you will find in the folder called \"scraped_anime_list\". Note that I prefer using the English name of the anime if it exists, and if it doesn't I get the Japanese name. Please use this list to obtain the anime ids if you intend to scrape MAL yourself, it will save you a LOT of time.\n5. I thought that someone else might've gone through and same process and voila, I found [MyAnimeList Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azathoth42/myanimelist) on kaggle. I didn't want to wait for my scraper to finish scraping, so I decided to use this \"anime_cleaned.csv\" version of this list. The lists from this dataset are what you find in the \"kaggle_anime_list\" folder.\n6. Cleaning anime names is a task in and of itself. Within the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Etrama/anime-image-scraper), refer to the file called \"notes_and_todo.md\" to look at all the cleaning troubles. I tried my best to remove all:\n   - Anime Movies: Since you have for instance One Piece (the anime) and One Piece Movie 1, One Piece Movie 2, and so on.\n  - Seasons: MAL is an anime ranker. Different anime seasons can show up on the list with different ranks. I retain the original anime name (the most basic ones, for instance, just \"Gintama\" instead of \"Gintama Season 4\".\n7. Ultimately, I manually curated around 300 anime names, which reduced to 231 after removing duplicates, since after the curation, \"Gintama\" and \"Gintama: Enchousen\" would both be named \"Gintama\". This list with the duplicates is what you find in the file called \"UsableAnimeList.xlsx\" within the \"top_anime_list\" folder.\n8. This list is then rid of the duplicates and used to scrape the image URLs for each anime found in the folder called \"anime_img_urls\".\n9. These URLs are then used to scrape the anime images themselves, found in the folder called \"anime_images\".\n10. Also the tags are only a guide, feel free to use this dataset for any Deep Learning task.\n\n## Sources\n- [JikanPy](https://github.com/abhinavk99/jikanpy)\n- [Useful MAL forum post](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=2000753)\n- Google Image Search\n- Cover image and thumnail obtained from [Safebooru](https://safebooru.org/index.php?page=post&s=view&id=4293259)",
