To collect this kind of information, I built newspipe a scalable pipeline to crawl and extract data from news websites. Showing the power and flexibility of the pipeline, I collected articles from German-speaking publishers by providing the pipeline only with the URL of the website. This dataset is the result of the demonstration. I mainly crawled articles from 15 news sources over an extended period of time.
