This dataset is intended for beginners so that they can get a taste of advanced Excel functions which is perhaps one of the key skills required to be a great data scientist. I too got my hands dirty with the dataset and played with some advanced Excel functions. Further, this dataset can also be used for a predictive model as to which country is likely to fetch the highest number of gold in a particular sports category (just an example), etc. ",
