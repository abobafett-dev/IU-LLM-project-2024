Fatal Encounters is the first national database to track how many people are killed by police. It began as a crowdsourced effort to compile public records about incidents where law enforcement officials killed someone. Although, he later changed his approach to compiling news reports that he finds with Google alerts.\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset is a CSV file and contains 28335 rows and 29 columns.\nThe 29 variables are the following:\n   -  Unique ID\n   -  Subject's name\n   - Subject's age\n   - Subject's gender\n   - Subject's race\n   - Subject's race with imputations\n   - Imputation probability\n   - URL of image of deceased\n   - Date of injury resulting in death (month/day/year)\n   - Location of injury (address)\n   - Location of death (city)\n   - Location of death (state)\n   - Location of death (zip code)\n   - Location of death (county)\n   - Full Address\n   - Latitude\n   - Longitude\n   - Agency responsible for death\n   - Cause of death\n   - A brief description of the circumstances surrounding the death\n   - Dispositions/Exclusions INTERNAL USE, NOT FOR ANALYSIS\n   - Intentional Use of Force (Developing)\n   - Link to news article or photo of official document\n   - Symptoms of mental illness?
