  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\nWith the increasing number of accidents in Indonesia, analysis of accident data is still need to considered and analyzed. Moreover, traffic accident information from social media such as Twitter is easy to obtain when compared to other data source from police or government institutions. In this work, we tried to create a traffic accident dataset. We do scraping on Twitter and get 157.613 tweets, then do a text processing which involves case folding, filtering, tokenizing, and stopword removal. To find out wheter the tweet is true about accident information, we take some data as testing data then do word embedding using FastText method and classification with SVM, KNN, and Nai\u0308ve Bayes algorithms then test the model with K-fold validation and confusion matrix accuracy. The results show that the validation score and accuracy score is good with 86% and 88% when SVM algorithm with linear kernel was done. This result model then applied to all dataset containing 157,613 tweets taken through the scraping process since April 2019 until April 2020 and produce predictions that can be used for further research and uploaded to [www.dodyagung.com/dataset/accident](https://www.dodyagung.com/dataset/accident).\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThis dataset is part of my graduate thesis and [international journal paper](https://doi.org/10.30534/ijeter/2020/04832020), please cite if you use this dataset.
