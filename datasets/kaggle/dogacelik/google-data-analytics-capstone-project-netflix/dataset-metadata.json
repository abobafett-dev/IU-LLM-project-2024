These skills will be used to complete the imagined task which was given by Netflix. The analysis process of this task will be consisted of following steps. Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.\n\n\nScenario:\n\nThe Netflix Chief Content Officer, Bela Bajaria, believes that companies success depends on to provide the customers what they want. Bajaria stated that the goal of this task is to find most wanted contents of the movies which will be added to the portfolio. Most of the movie contracts are signed before they come to the theaters, and it is hard to know if the customers really want to watch that movie and if the movie will be successful. There for my team wants to understand what type of content a movies success depends on. From these insights my team will design an investment strategy to choose the most popular movies that are expected to be in theaters in the near future. But first, Netflix executives must approve our recommendations. To be able to do that we must provide satisfying data insights along with professional data visualizations. \n\n\nAbout the Company:\n\n\nAt Netflix, we want to entertain the world. Whatever your taste, and no matter where you live, we give you access to best-in-class TV series, documentaries, feature films and games. Our members control what they want to watch, when they want it, in one simple subscription. We\u2019re streaming in more than 30 languages and 190 countries, because great stories can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. We are the world\u2019s biggest fans of entertainment, and we\u2019re always looking to help you find your next favorite story.\n\nAs a company Netflix knows that it is important to acquire or produce movies that people want to watch. \n\nThere for Bajaria has set a clear goal: Define an investment strategy that will allow Netflix to provide customers the movies what they want to watch which will maximize the Sales.\n\n\n\nAsk:\n\nBusiness Task: \nTo find out what kind of movie customers wants to watch and if the content type really has a correlation with the movie success.\nStakeholders: \n\nBela Bajaria: She joined Netflix in 2016 to oversee unscripted and scripted series. Bajaria also responsible from the content selection and strategy for different regions. \n\nNetflix content analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Netflix content strategy.\n\nNetflix executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended content program.\n\n\nPrepare:\n\nI start my preparation procedure by downloading every piece of data I'll need for the study. Top 1000 Highest-Grossing Movies of All Time.csv will be used. Additionally, 15 Lowest-Grossing Movies of All Time.csv was found during the data research and this dataset will be analyst as well. The data has been made available by IMDB and shared this two following URL addresses: https://www.imdb.com/list/ls098063263/ and https://www.imdb.com/list/ls069238222/ .\n\n\nProcess:\n\nData Cleaning: \n\nSQL: To begin the data cleaning process, I opened both csv file in SQL and conducted following operations: \n\n\u2022\tChecked for and removed any duplicates. \n\u2022\tChecked if there any null values. \n\u2022\tRemoved the columns that are not necessary.\n\u2022\tTrim the Description column to have only gross profit in it. (This cleaning procedure only used for 1000 Highest-Grossing Movies of All Time.csv dataset.)\n\n\u2022\tRenamed the Description column as Gross_Profit. (This cleaning procedure only used for 1000 Highest-Grossing Movies of All Time.csv dataset.)\n\nFollwing SQL codes were used during the data cleaning:\n#SQL CODE used for Highest Grossing Movies DATASET\n\nSELECT \nPosition,\nSUBSTR(Description,34,12) as Gross_Profit,\nTitle, \nIMDb_Rating,\nRuntime__mins_, \nYear, \nGenres, \nNum_Votes, \nRelease_Date\n FROM `even-electron-400301.Highest_Gross_Movies.1` \n\n#SQL CODE used for Lowest Grossing Movies DATASET\n\nSELECT \nPosition,\nTitle, \nIMDb_Rating,\nRuntime__mins_, \nYear, \nGenres, \nNum_Votes, \nRelease_Date\nFROM `even-electron-400301.Lowest_Grossing_Movies.2` \nOrder By Position\n\n\n\n\nAnalyze:\n\nAs a starter, I want to reemphasize the business task once again. Is content has a big impact on a movie\u2019s success?\n\nTo answer this question, there were a few information that I projected that I could pull of and use it during my analysis. \n\n\u2022\tAverage gross profit \n\u2022\tNumber of Genres\n\u2022\tTotal Gross Profit of the most popular genres\n\u2022\tThe distribution of the Gross income on Genres\n\n\nI used Microsoft Excel for the bullet points above. The operations to achieve the values above are as follows:\n \n\u2022\tAverage function for Average Gross profit in 1000 Highest-Grossing Movies of All Time.\n\u2022\tCreated a pivot table to work on Genres and Gross_Profit\n\u2022\tAnalyzed all genre which consist different categories (exp: Action, Adventure, Horrror ...) in it by using filtering for specific categories like, action, adventure etc. \n\u2022\tThe content analysis mentioned in the last bullet point implemented also for 15 Lowest-Grossing Movies of All Time dataset. \n\nShare:\nThe dashboard I created for the project is also posteed on tableau, you can find the dashboard can be found here\n\nFor the visualizations, it was aimed to emphasize the only the data which demonstrates the key differences between Genre and Gross Profit. \nFollowing visualizations were included into the dashboard;\n\n\u2022\tGross income distributions on movie genres\n\u2022\tGenre\u2019s category distribution for highest grossing movies\n\u2022\tGenre\u2019s category distribution for lowest grossing movies\n\n\n\nHere is a summary of the most meaningful insights for content and movie success:\n\nHighest Grossing Movies: \n\n\u2022\tAmong the 1000 most profited movies the most common genre is \u201cAction, Adventure, Sci-Fi\u201d, 64 movies have this genre type in the list.\n\u2022\t The following genre type is \u201cAction, Adventure, Thriller\u201d with 33 movies. \n\u2022\tEach Genre has several categories in it. During analysis it was observed that some categories has occurred more than other categories. \n\u2022\tAmong the highest grossing movies there were clear difference between different categories that is used in genres. According to my analysis among the 1000 movies 520 movies possessed adventure category and 484 movies had action category in it. \n\u2022\tMovies with horror genre is one of the least sucessfull ones in the 1000 highest grossing movies list in terms of gross profit.\n\nLowest Grossing Movies: \n\u2022\tThere is no movie in the lowest gross income movies with action or adventure genres.\n\u2022\t30% of the 15 least grossing movies has horror genre which is the most common genre in this list.\n\nAbout the analysis: \n\nThe data collected from secondary resources was limited to come up with a detailed analysis. Since the analysis has conducted with the limited data, it might affect the insights and might not demonstrate us the real-life distribution which will lead to wrong strategies especially when it comes to different regions. \n\nAct: \n\nBased on my analysis, following actions are recommended which I believe that it will help content department to create an effective strategy for content creation and selection. \n\n\n\u2022\tAction/Adventure base strategy: When Netflix signing with a new movie or creating a new one, we can add more movies with action and adventure category to our portfolio. \n\u2022\tHorror Movies: Netflix should give less priority to horror movies. Statistically, horror movies are the least successful movies among all. And to increase the number of movies which will be invested it will increase the probability to fail.\n\u2022\tCombination of the forces: Netflix can try to combine the most successful categories in terms of gross profit. For instance, comedy with action or animation and action to increase the attraction. \n\n\nBy implementing these strategies, Netflix can make more meaningful decision on content creation and sign more precise movie agreements which are demanded by the audience. \n",
