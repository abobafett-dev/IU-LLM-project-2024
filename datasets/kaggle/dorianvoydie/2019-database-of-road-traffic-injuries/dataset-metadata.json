These seizures are gathered in a sheet entitled bodily accident analysis report. All of these sheets constitute the national file of traffic accidents known as the \u201cTBAA file\u201d administered by the National Interministerial Road Safety Observatory \"ONISR\".\n\nThe databases, extracted from the TBAA file, list all the bodily accidents of traffic, occurring during a specific year in mainland France, in the departments Overseas (Guadeloupe, Guyana, Martinique, Reunion Island and Mayotte since 2012) and in the others overseas territories (Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint-Martin, Wallis-et-Futuna, French Polynesia and New Caledonia; available only from 2019 in open data) with a simplified description.

The \"hospitalized injured\" indicator is no longer labeled by the official statistics authority since 2019.
