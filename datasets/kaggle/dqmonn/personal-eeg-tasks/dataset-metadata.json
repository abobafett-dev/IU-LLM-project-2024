Recordings were done over a space of a couple months. Subject is male, 20/21 years old at time of recording.\n\nTasks include:\n\n- Mental arithmetic (high concentration)\n- Reading technical articles (medium-high concentration)\n- Listening to technical podcasts, reading the transcript (medium-high concentration)\n- Browsing the internet (low-medium concentration)\n- Just sitting there, eyes open or closed (low concentration)\n\n### Content\n\nData includes alpha, beta, gamma, delta and theta waves of four different electrodes (see Muse specifications for positioning).\nFFT was applied (128 bins).\n\nEach row has a self-assigned concentration value between 0 and 1, including high values for mental arithmetic and technical reading, low values for relaxation and browsing.",
