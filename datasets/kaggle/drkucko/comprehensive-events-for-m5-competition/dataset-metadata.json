The dataset is meant to be used with the `calendar.csv` file of the M5 Competition, which contains the date information and the `wm_yr_wk` / `d` keys.

That is, one can see finals events that are indicated as \"tentative\" and with teams that are blank because they would not have been known. The schedules for games, specifically NBA and NHL, are set in advance, so any information that would be known is indeed captured.
