All Shlouder X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients\u2019 routine clinical care.\n\nFor the analysis of shoulder x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nLicense: CC BY 4.0\n\n\nPurpose:\n\nTo develop a deep learning algorithmto for classify the anteroposterior radiographs of the shoulder with can achieve 98% accuracy, 98% precision, and 98% recall.",
