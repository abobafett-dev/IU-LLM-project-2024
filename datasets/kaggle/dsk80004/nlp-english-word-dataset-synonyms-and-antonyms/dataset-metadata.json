Each file has a specific use case, but all are collected here for ease of use when working with NLP neural networks.\n\n\n\n\n\nEasily the 3 most important files in this dataset are the:\n  Words Map.json which holds 122,188 words each with a list of every know synonym and antonym, each one contains a value of relativity. A negative number relates to an antonym, and positive to a synonym. A value of 0.1 simply means that it either has a low relationship as a synonym, or not all sites considered this a synonym.\n\n  Approved Sentences Which contains a list of every example sentence which was given for every word, excluding non-English languages and news articles, as well as a few math equations for some reason. These have been moved to denied sentences for training purposes if needed.\n\n  Word Values Relativity Normalized, Which contains all the words sorted by relativity, for more information as to how this was accomplished check out the description found for the file. This file is uses to help assist an auto encoder to keep words relative to each other closer together, so the AI can simplify its rounding errors and still get coherent responses.",
