It contains two folders, \"original\" and \"retouch,\" providing a rich resource for practical applications. For instance, you can explore noise reduction techniques such as Gaussian blur, bilateral filtering, and non-local means to reduce noise while preserving important details. \nImage restoration techniques, including Wiener filtering and deconvolution, help recover images degraded by motion blur or defocus. Lastly, the dataset can be used for pattern recognition and classification, training machine learning models to recognize and classify different types of images or objects.",
