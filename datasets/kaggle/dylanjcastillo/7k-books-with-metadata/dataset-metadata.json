After a bit of googling, I found a few datasets. Sadly, most of them had some issues that made them unusable for me (e.g, missing description of the book, a mix of different languages but no column to specify the language per row or weird delimiters). \n\nSo I decided to make a dataset that would match my purposes.\n\nFirst, I got ISBNs from [Soumik's Goodreads-books dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks). Using those identifiers, I crawled the Google Books API to extract the books' information.\n\nThen, I merged those results with some of the original columns from the dataset and after some cleaning I got the dataset you see here.\n\n### What can I do with this?\nDifferent Exploratory Data Analysis, clustering of books by topics/category, content-based recommendation engine using different fields from the book's description. \n\n### Why is this dataset smaller than Soumik's Goodreads-books?\nMany of the ISBNs of that dataset did not return valid results from the Google Books API. I plan to update this in the future, using more fields (e.g., title, author) in the API requests, as to have a bigger dataset.\n\n### What did you use to build this dataset?\nCheck out the repoistory here [Google Books Crawler](https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/google_books_crawler)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset relied heavily on [Soumik's Goodreads-books dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks).",
