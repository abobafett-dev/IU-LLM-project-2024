Each row in the file corresponds to an image in the dataset. The labels are integers that map to a specific category of character or object represented in the image.\n\n# **Usage:**\n\n**This dataset can be used for various machine learning tasks such as:**\n\n* **Image Classification:** You can use the images and their labels to train a model to classify the type of character or object in an image.\n* **Object Detection:** If the images contain multiple objects, you can use it for object detection tasks.\n* **Image Generation:** You can use the dataset to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate new pixel art images.",
