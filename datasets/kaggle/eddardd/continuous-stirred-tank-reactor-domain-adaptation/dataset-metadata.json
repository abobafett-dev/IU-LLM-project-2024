This system carries an exothermic reaction A -&gt; B, and a feedback loop for controlling the reactor's temperature. There are 7 measured variables,\n\n* Concentration of A in the inlet flow,\n* Temperature of the inlet flow,\n* Temperature of the inlet coolant flow,\n* Coolant flow-rate,\n* Concentration of B in the outlet flow,\n* Temperature of the outlet flow,\n* Temperature of the outlet coolant flow.\n\nThe goal is to predict a set of 12 faults from these 7 variables, measured throughout 200 minutes, at a 1 minute rate. Further description of the considered faults is included in Chapter 5 of [1] and [2].\n\n## Domain Adaptation Scenario\n\nAs described in [1, 2, 3], the CSTR system can be used as a simple study-case of domain adaptation. Indeed, the system is simple enough so that a set of ordinary differential equations represent the system accurately. These equations depend on a series of parameters (i.e. reactor volume, reaction speed, fluid density) that may change from one application to another. These are described in Chapter 5 of [1].\n\nThe domain adaptation scenario is as follows. A source domain is generated through a fixed set of parameters (described in Table 5.1. of [2]). We generate 6 domains, by varying the reaction order N within values [1.0, 1.5, 2.0], and introducing a random noise (10, 15 and 20%) in the parameters. This scenario is described in detail by [1, 2].\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you find this dataset useful in your research, please consider citing,\n\n```\n@phdthesis{montesuma2021,\n    author       = {Eduardo Fernandes Montesuma}, \n    title        = {Cross-Domain Fault Diagnosis through Optimal Transport},\n    school       = {Universidade Federal do Cear\u00e1},\n    year         = 2021,\n    type         = {Bachelor's Thesis}\n}  \n```\n\nand\n\n```\n@article{montesuma2022cross,\n  title={Cross-domain fault diagnosis through optimal transport for a CSTR process},\n  author={Montesuma, Eduardo Fernandes and Mulas, Michela and Corona, Francesco and Mboula, Fred Maurice Ngole},\n  journal={IFAC-PapersOnLine},\n  volume={55},\n  number={7},\n  pages={946--951},\n  year={2022},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n```\n\n## References\n\n[1] Montesuma, E., 2021.
