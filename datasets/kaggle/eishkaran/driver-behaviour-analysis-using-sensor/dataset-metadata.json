  "descriptionNullable": "Driving behavior plays a vital role in maintaining safe and sustainable transport, and specifically, in the area of traffic management and control, driving behavior is of great importance since specific driving behaviors are significantly related with traffic congestion levels. Beyond that, it affects fuel consumption, air pollution, public health as well as personal mental health and psychology. Use of Smartphone sensors for data acquisition has emerged as a means to understand and model driving behavior. Our aim is to analyze driving behavior using on Smartphone sensors\u2019 data streams. We present Smartphone sensor (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Proximity, etc.) data recorded in live traffic while driver was executing the driving events.\nThe datasets folder include .csv files of sensor data like Accelerometer, Gyroscope, etc. This data was recorded in live traffic while driver was executing certain driving events. The travel time for each one way trip was approximately 5kms - 20kms. The smartphone position was fixed horizontally in the vehicles utility box. Vehicle type used for data recording was LMV.",
