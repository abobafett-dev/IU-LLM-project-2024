Whilst this is useful, many columns were renamed into simple attributes e.g 'Are you self-employed?' is standardised to 'self_employed'. As none of the\n surveys from the following years have had this treatment, it was difficult to reverse-engineer the processing steps to make the attributes match. Also, it's great to have all the data in one place.\n\n## Similarity matrix\nThe associated similarity matrix, stored as a numpy-readable file (.npy) is a supplementary file for the previously mentioned kernel. This was uploaded due to the unfortunate fact that any [SpaCy models ](https://spacy.io/usage/models) that are contain word vectors (aka any model other than *sm*) are not supported by Kaggle on the date of writing (Jun 2019). Please see the associated kernel for more information on how this matrix was created.\n\n## Acknowledgements\nThe original data collection and hosting has all been provided by [Open-Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI).](https://osmihelp.org) you can find all of the datasets (including 2016, 2017 and 2018) [here](https://osmihelp.org/research). \n\n# Inspiration\nThe inspiration for uploading these datasets was to allow Kaggle users such as myself to have greater control over the pre-processing and standardisation of attributes.",
