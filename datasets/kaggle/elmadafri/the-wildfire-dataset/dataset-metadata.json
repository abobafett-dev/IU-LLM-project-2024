Spanning 2,700 aerial and ground-based images, it has been curated from a diverse array of online platforms such as government databases, Flickr, and Unsplash. By capturing a wide spectrum of environmental scenarios, forest variants, geographical locations, and the intricate dynamics of forest ecosystems and fire events, the dataset stands as a thoughtful benchmark for research in forest fire detection.\n\nEvery image within this dataset is sourced from the Public Domain, emphasizing the dataset's commitment to transparency. Users can delve into the specifics, accessing detailed information about the URL origins and resolutions for each image. A defining feature of our research is the innovative Multi-Task Learning framework that integrates multi-class confounding elements, crafted specifically to refine forest fire detection. This methodology aims to bolster the model's accuracy and reduce false alarms.
