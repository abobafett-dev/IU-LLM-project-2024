After downloading, I discovered there were many missing rows of data. I tried to compute a mode, then a mean, for the missing values, but this made the data skewed so I abandoned the idea. The data time period is 3 years \u2013 2020- 2022 and it has 9 variables which include: company name, location, industry, number of staff laid off, percentage laid off, date of layoff, stage of funding, country, and funds raised by the company.\nI ended up deleting the missing values, which left only 876 rows of data. \n\nLosing a job isn\u2019t just a loss of a steady paycheck, it has far-reaching psychological implications which trigger mental health issues in individuals. Since the Covid-19 pandemic hit, a lot of companies have laid off staff, some have closed shop and many more companies will continue to lay off staff. This has made people more interested in the reasons for layoffs and their effect on the psychological, social, economic, and mental health implications. \n\nThe purpose of this data analysis is to answer the following questions: \no\tWhat insights can we draw from the dataset?\no\tWhat country has the highest number of layoffs?\no\tWhat location?\no\tIs it peculiar to an industry?\no\twhat top companies have the highest numbers?\no\tare there certain stages in a company where the tendency to layoff staff is highest?\no\tIs there a significant number of layoffs based on the date? \no\tWhat are the key takeaways?\n\n\nI also analyzed this dataset using Tableau, please visit (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ema.oyeyiola/viz/Layoffs_16724822868200/Covid-19relatedLayoffsandtheaftermath) to see the visuals!
