  "descriptionNullable": "## Context\nThe datasets featured below were extracted from bikez.com on **April 30, 2022** using a custom scraper in order to enrich an existing used motorcycle dataset for a hackathon competition. These datasets are great for **Exploratory Data Analysis** and the one titled `all_bikez_raw.csv` is especially good for practicing **Data Cleaning** skills. These datasets also provide great **enrichment** for [this used motorcycle sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/motorcycle-dataset) by Nehal Birla and Nishant Verma.\n\n## Content\nThere are two different main datasets, along with one reference file. `all_bikez_raw.csv` contains the data exactly as was scraped from the source website (referenced below). `all_bikez_curated.csv` is what's left of the raw dataset after going through an initial preprocessing stage where only the most available, and most relevant, attributes were kept. Many of these attributes underwent some format cleaning but there is still some work to be done. Last but not least `bikez_brands.csv` is a single column CSV containing all the brand names for which motorcycles exist on the source website. I used this list of brands in order to extract brand names from the \"Model\" column of the raw dataset \u2014 a task that turned out to be unexpectedly challenging for me. \n\nThe sizes for all files featured within this Kaggle dataset are shown below \u2014 along with a list of attributes, and their description summaries, for the **_curated.csv** file:\n- `all_bikez_raw.csv` - 38472 observations x 85 attributes\n- `all_bikez_curated.csv` - 38472 observations x 28 attributes\n- `bikez_brands.csv` - 583 unique observations\n\n 0.   **Brand** - brand name of the motorcycle\n 1.   **Model** - model name of the motorcycle\n 2.   **Year** - year the motorcycle was built\n 3.   **Category** - sub-class the motorcycle belongs to in the market (style of motorcycle)\n 4.   **Rating** - review average out of 5 stars\n 5.   **Displacement (ccm)** - engine size of the motorcycle in cubic centimeters (ccm)\n 6.   **Power (hp)** - max power output in horsepower (hp) and kilowatt (kW) along with peak power rpm\n 7.   **Torque (Nm)** - max torque in newton-meters (Nm) and foot-pounds (ft-lbs) along with peak torque rpm\n 8.   **Engine cylinder** - number of cylinders in the engine as well as configuration\n 9.   **Engine stroke** - number of stages to complete one power stroke of the engine\n 10.  **Gearbox** - number of gears in transmission\n 11.  **Bore (mm)** - diameter of each cylinder in millimeters (mm) and inches (in)\n 12.  **Stroke (mm)** - distance within the cylinder a piston travels in millimeters (mm) and inches (in)\n 13.  **Transmission type** - type of transmission of the motorcycle\n 14.  **Front brakes** - type of front brake\n 15.  **Rear brakes** - type of rear brake\n 16.  **Front tire** - front tire size\n 17.  **Rear tire** - rear tire size\n 18.  **Front suspension** - front suspension type and configuration\n 19.  **Rear suspension** - rear suspension type and configuration\n 20.  **Dry weight (kg)** - weight of the motorcycle, without any fluids, in kilograms (kg) and pounds (lbs)\n 21.  **Wheelbase (mm)** -  distance between the points where the front and rear wheels touch the ground in millimeters (mm)\n 22.  **Fuel capacity (lts)** - maximum capacity of fuel tank in liters (lts)\n 23.  **Fuel system** - fuel delivery system into engine\n 24.  **Fuel control** - valve configuration fo the engine\n 25.  **Seat height (mm)** - height from bottom of seat to the ground in millimeters (mm)\n 26.  **Cooling system** - engine cooling system\n 27.  **Color options** - different color options of the motorcycle model for that particular year\ndtypes: float64(9), int64(1), object(18)\n\n## Source\nMotorcycle Data - https://bikez.com/main/index.php",
