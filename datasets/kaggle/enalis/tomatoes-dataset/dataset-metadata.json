  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset consists of a total of 7226 images of tomatoes in four different states: Unripe, Ripe, Old, and Damaged. The dataset has been split into a training set and a validation set in an 9:1 ratio, with 90% of the images used for training and the remaining 10% used for validation. This dataset can be used for image classification tasks, particularly for identifying the state of tomatoes. The images were carefully selected to ensure a diverse range of tomato states and were collected from various sources.\n\nIEEE Access Paper related to this dataset: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10187138",
