  "descriptionNullable": "# Forbes Global 2000: World's Largest Companies Dataset (2003-2023)\nThe 20th anniversary edition of the Global 2000 ranking offers a fascinating insight into the evolution of the world's largest companies over the past two decades. While stalwarts like Citigroup and General Electric once dominated the top spots, newer players like JPMorgan, Apple, and Alphabet now lead the pack. JPMorgan's ascent to the number one position reflects its resilience and strategic acquisitions, while Berkshire Hathaway's slip underscores the volatility of investment markets. The metrics used to compile the list - sales, profits, assets, and market value - reveal the staggering scale of these corporate behemoths, with total revenues surpassing $50 trillion for the first time. Despite slight declines in profits and market value, the diversity of countries represented, with the U.S. and China at the forefront, highlights the global nature of corporate power. This comprehensive ranking, based on the latest financial data available, provides invaluable insights into the dynamic landscape of global business.\n\nUtilizing Python web scraping techniques, I meticulously extracted data from the esteemed Forbes Global 2000 list, providing invaluable insights into the world's largest companies. Employing BeautifulSoup and requests libraries, I navigated through the intricacies of Forbes' website structure, capturing essential metrics such as sales, profits, assets, and market value. By meticulously parsing HTML elements and applying efficient data extraction strategies, I compiled a comprehensive dataset reflecting the financial prowess and global influence of these corporate giants. This endeavor enabled me to delve deep into the dynamic landscape of corporate rankings, fostering a deeper understanding of the evolving business ecosystem.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F15079517%2Fd9ce6502246635e8793e7ea115652ed1%2Fforbes.png?generation=1711391862360726&alt=media)\n",
