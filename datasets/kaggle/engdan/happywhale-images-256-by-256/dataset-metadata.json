  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nThe 2022 Happywhale competition has provided lots of train and test images to work on image classification models for whales and dolphins. The original dataset has a size greater than 60GB which may be difficult to work with in a local machine with limited hard drive storage space.\nThis dataset is a resized version where all the original dataset images were resized to 256 by 256 pixels and had applied a gray scale color map.\n\nFor those who are beginners in image classification (like myself), it can provide you the following bennefits:\n* Possibility to download the dataset and work in your local machine.\n* Reduced computational time during your model experimentation.",
