  "descriptionNullable": "The dataset contains wrist-accelerometer and audio data from people performing at-home tasks such as sweeping, brushing teeth, washing hands, or watching TV. These activities represent a subset of activities that are needed to be able to live independently. Being able to detect activities with wearable devices in real-time has the potential for the realization of assistive technologies with applications in different domains such as elderly care and mental health monitoring. By making this dataset public, researchers can test different machine learning algorithms for activity recognition, especially, sensor data fusion methods and mult-view learning.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe database contains three directories. One for each user. Each directory contains the raw accelerometer data.\nThe features file contains extracted features. Features prefixed with \"v1_\" are Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients extracted from the audio data. Features prefixed with 'v2_\" were extracted from the accelerometer.\n\nFor more details about the dataset you can check the original paper here: https://osf.io/preprints/osf/j723c\n\n**Terms of use**\n\nThe data is released fully open for research and educational purposes. The use of the dataset for purposes such as competitions and commercial purposes needs prior written permission. In all documents and papers that use or refer to the dataset or report experimental results based on the HTAD, a reference to the related article needs to be added: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-67835-7_17.",
