The dataset contains a unique ID for each patient, the type of cancer (diagnosis), the visual characteristics of the cancer and the average values of these characteristics.**\n\n## **\ud83d\udcda The main features of the dataset are as follows:**\n\n1. **id**: Represents a unique ID of each patient.\n2. **diagnosis**: Indicates the type of cancer. This property can take the values \"M\" (Malignant - Benign) or \"B\" (Benign - Malignant).\n3. **radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave points_mean**: Represents the mean values of the cancer's visual characteristics.\n\nThere are also several categorical features where patients in the dataset are labeled with numerical values. You can examine them in the Chart area.\n\nOther features contain specific ranges of average values of the features of the cancer image:\n\n- **radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave points_mean**\n\nEach of these features is mapped to a table containing the number of values in a given range. ***You can examine the Chart Tables***\n\n**Each sample contains the patient's unique ID, the cancer diagnosis and the average values of the cancer's visual characteristics.**\n\n**Such a dataset can be used to train or test models and algorithms used to make cancer diagnoses. Understanding and analyzing the dataset can contribute to the improvement of cancer-related visual features and diagnosis.**\n\n##\u2728 Examples of Projects that can be done with the Data Set\n\n**Logistic Regression:** This algorithm can be used effectively for binary classification problems. In this dataset, logistic regression may be an appropriate choice since there are \"Malignant\" (benign) and \"Benign\" (malignant) classes. It can be used to predict cancer type with the visual features in the dataset.\n\n**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** KNN classifies an example by looking at the k closest examples around it. This algorithm assumes that patients with similar characteristics tend to have similar types of cancer. KNN can be used for cancer diagnosis by taking into account neighborhood relationships in the data set.\n\n**Support Vector Machines (SVM):** SVM is effective for classification tasks, especially for two-class problems. Focusing on the clear separation of classes in the dataset, SVM is a powerful algorithm that can be used for cancer diagnosis.\n\n##  **Data Set Related Training Notebooks \ud83d\ude0a (\"I Recommend You Review\")**\n\n**K-NN Project:** https://www.kaggle.com/code/erdemtaha/prediction-cancer-data-with-k-nn-95\n\n**Logistic Regress\u00fcon:** https://www.kaggle.com/code/erdemtaha/cancer-prediction-96-5-with-logistic-regression\n\n## \ud83d\udc96 Acknowledgements and Information\n\n**This is a copy of content that has been elaborated for educational purposes and published to reach more people, you can access the original source from the link below, please do not forget to support that data**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data\n\n**This database can also be accessed via the UW CS ftp server:**\n\ud83d\udd17 ftp.cs.wisc.edu cd math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/WDBC/\n\n**It can also be found at the UCI Machine Learning Repository:**\n\ud83d\udd17 https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29\n\n## **\ud83d\udce9 Personal Information:**\n\n**If you have some questions or curiosities about the data or studies, you can contact me as you wish from the links below \ud83d\ude0a**\n\n**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/erdem-taha-sokullu/\n\n**Mail:** erdemtahasokullu@gmail.com\n\n**Github:** https://github.com/Prometheussx\n\n**Kaggle:** https://www.kaggle.com/erdemtaha\n\n\n## \ud83d\udcdc License:\n\n**This Data has a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License You can review the license rules from the link below**\n\n**License Link:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
