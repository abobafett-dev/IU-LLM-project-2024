  "descriptionNullable": "This is the rock drill fault classification data set, used for the 2022 PHM Conference Data Challenge. The data is collected from a carefully instrumented hydraulic rock drill, operating in a test cell while inducing a number of faults. Hydraulic pressures are measured at 50kHz at three different locations, resulting in a detailed pressure signature for each fault. Due to wave propagation phenomena, the system is sensitive to individual differences between different rock drills, drills rigs and configurations. Such differences are introduced\nin the data by altering certain parameters in the test setup. An important part of the data is therefore the availability of No-fault reference cycles, which are supplied for all individuals. These reference cycles give information on how individuals\ndiffer from each other, and can be used to improve classification.\n\nThe challenge of this dataset is to handle the domain discrepancy between training/test, by utilizing the available no-fault reference data in some clever way.\n\nSo far, the correct labels for test/validation are not publicly released. If you wish to evaluate your result, send an email to the author containing result files as per the original challenge instructions.",
