  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset contains a comprehensive collection of Indian Sign Language (ISL) hand gestures representing the 26 letters of the English alphabet, captured using the MediaPipe pose estimation technology. The dataset includes over 50,000 high-quality images of hand gestures captured from various angles, lighting conditions, and skin tones. The dataset is ideal for researchers and developers working in the field of computer vision, machine learning, and sign language recognition.\n\nAbout this directory\n\nThe dataset directory includes subdirectories for each letter of the English alphabet, labeled from \"A\" to \"Z\". Each subdirectory contains a set of images depicting the hand gesture for the corresponding letter, captured using the MediaPipe pose estimation module. The images are stored in the JPG format and are named in a consistent format. The directory structure is designed to facilitate easy access and organization of the dataset for various machine learning tasks.",
