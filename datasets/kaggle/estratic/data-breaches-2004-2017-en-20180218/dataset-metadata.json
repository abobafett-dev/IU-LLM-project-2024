I wanted to visualize the data including the possibility to compare numbers between variable levels. I did some improvements in levels of variables as well as data, and I did a visualization. I also uploaded [this version of the dataset in Spanish][1]. I did the visualization with Tableau software.\n\nIn this post in my blog, you can read more about it: [Spanish version][2] and [English version][3]. You can also see the visualization in this link: [Spanish version][4] and [English version][5]. \n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset has 270 observations and 11 variables. Most of them, are categorical variables. Incidents happened between 2004 and 2017. Last updated: February 2018. Format: CSV2.\n\nVariables (columns) [EN]:\n\n - Entity: name of the organization (public or private) that had the breach. String\n - Alternative Name: other known names of the entity. String\n - Story: tells a summary of what happened. String\n - Year: year of the breach. Date\n - Records Lost: number of records that the breach compromised.Integer\n - Sector: organization's main sector (or field of business). String\n - Method of Leak: main cause of the breach.

Achieving a complete and exhaustive \"Data Breaches 2004-2017\" dataset, would help to an in-depth analysis of incidents in this period. 2017 has been the worst year in the history.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/estratic/brechas-datos-2004-2017-es-20180218\n  [2]: https://www.estratic.com/2018/02/09/visualizando-brechas-de-datos-2004-2017/\n  [3]: https://www.estratic.com/2018/02/09/visualizing-data-breaches-2004-2017-2/\n  [4]: https://www.estratic.com/brechas-de-datos/\n  [5]: https://www.estratic.com/data-breaches-viz/\n  [6]: http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/",
