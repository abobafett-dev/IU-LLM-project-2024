  "descriptionNullable": "**CSU101: A Campus Building Video Dataset for Computer Vision Education**\nOverview\n\nCSU101 is a novel video dataset designed to bridge the educational gap in Computer Vision. It provides a unique collection of campus-related imagery captured in full HD (1080p) at 24 frames per second, totaling 252,837 frames. This dataset aims to make the study of Computer Vision more accessible and relatable to students, featuring real-world objects and scenes they encounter daily. While intended for educational use, this dataset can be used for many cases in real-world data scenarios that uzilize object detection.\n\n**Dataset Contents**\n\n- Frames: 252,837 high-quality video frames.\n- Classification Labels: 48 distinct classifications of various campus buildings.\n- Object Detection Labels: Labels for five types of objects frequently encountered on college campuses: bike racks, trashcans, doors, electrical boxes, and light posts.\n- Video Quality: Captured at 24 FPS, 1080p resolution.\n\nCSU101 is designed for both classification and object detection tasks, making it versatile for educational purposes:\n\n- Classification: Students can learn to classify different types of campus buildings.\n- Object Detection: Students can practice detecting common objects within a campus setting.\n- The dataset includes six benchmark models to help users test and compare their algorithms for image classification, and 5 benchmarks for object detection. These benchmarks provide a baseline for performance on image and object detection tasks.\n\n**Educational Tools**\n\nIncluded are educational notebooks designed to help both professors and students quickly integrate CSU101 into their curricula. These notebooks provide step-by-step guides and practical exercises to get started with the dataset.\n\nCSU101 is ideal for:\n- Educational purposes: Particularly suited for introductory courses in Computer Vision.\n- Research: Can be used for studies on object detection and classification in urban and semi-urban environments.\nAccess\n\nCSU101 is available here on Kaggle. To get started, download the dataset and check out the included educational notebooks.\n\nContribute\nWe welcome contributions to the dataset, whether in the form of additional labels, enhanced annotations, or improved benchmark models. Please reach out if you are interested in contributing! Additionally we're looking for collaboration with more universities, to create a world wide campus dataset!",
