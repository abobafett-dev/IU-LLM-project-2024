I wish other machine learning beginners share this brilliant moment with this dataset. (already received the agreement to open this dataset with an author of the original flower dataset)\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains the folder 'flower_images' containing 1680 png images and the 'flower_label.csv' file. \n\nWith 'flower_images', you can load the png images and stack the matrix of each image. \n\nWith 'flower_label.csv', you can load the CSV file and then know each image's label. The first column is image filename and the second column is label of the image. \n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe link of original dataset of this flower extension is [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/olgabelitskaya/flower-color-images/discussion?sort=votes)",
