  "descriptionNullable": "# Overview\nThis dataset contains time series weather data collected at 30-minute intervals, starting from January 2, 2022, to May 31, 2024. The dataset includes various weather attributes such as temperature, dew point, humidity, wind speed, and more. The data is collected for a specific city in a country, providing valuable insights for weather analysis and forecasting models.\n\n# Dataset Attributes\nThe dataset contains the following attributes:\n\n- **date**: Date of the observation in YYYY-MM-DD format.\n- **time**: Time of the observation in HH format.\n- **temperature**: Temperature recorded at the given date and time (in degrees Celsius).\n- **dew_point**: Dew point temperature recorded at the given date and time (in degrees Celsius).\n- **humidity**: Humidity percentage recorded at the given date and time.\n- **wind**: Wind direction at the given date and time.\n- **wind_speed**: Wind speed recorded at the given date and time (in km/h or m/s).\n- **wind_gust**: Wind gust speed recorded at the given date and time (in km/h or m/s).\n- **pressure**: Atmospheric pressure recorded at the given date and time (in hPa).\n- **precip**: Precipitation recorded at the given date and time (in mm).\n- **condition**: Weather condition description (e.g., Clear, Cloudy, Rain).\n- **city**: Name of the city where the data was collected.\n- **country**: Name of the country where the data was collected.\n\n# Data Collection Period\nStart Date: January 2, 2022\nEnd Date: May 31, 2024\nFrequency: Every 30 minutes\n\n# Usage\nThis dataset is ideal for:\n\n- Time series analysis\n- Weather forecasting\n- Climate research\n- Machine learning projects involving weather data\n- Statistical analysis of weather patterns\n\n# Example Use Cases\n-  **Weather Forecasting** : Use machine learning algorithms to predict future weather conditions based on historical data.\n- **Climate Analysis** : Analyze the changes in weather patterns over the given period.\n- **Anomaly Detection**: Detect unusual weather events by comparing current data with historical trends.\n-  **Feature Engineering**: Create new features for machine learning models, such as average temperature, humidity trends, and more.\n\n# Acknowledgments\nThe data in this dataset was collected from weather stations and aggregated for analysis purposes. We acknowledge the efforts of meteorological services and data providers for making this data available.\n",
