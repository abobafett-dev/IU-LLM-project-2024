The task is to create a classification model, which can accurately classify if a road is clean or littered. Because of the lack of data, pretrained models and data augmentation may be used.\n\nSuch a classification model can be used to develope applications to detect littered part of roads using cameras and send necessary service to those areas. \n\n#### Naviagate Dataset:\n\n1. **Images**: Folder containing all the road images.\n2. **metadata.csv**: A csv file mapping the image name with the class label.\n\n",
