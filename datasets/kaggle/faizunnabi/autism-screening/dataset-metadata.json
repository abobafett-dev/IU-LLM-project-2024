Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis.  The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits. However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature. Hence, we propose a new dataset related to autism screening of adults that contained 20 features to be utilised for further analysis especially in determining influential autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases. In this dataset, we record ten behavioural features (AQ-10-Adult) plus ten individuals characteristics that have proved to be effective in detecting the ASD cases from controls in behaviour science. \n## Source: \nFadi Fayez Thabtah\nDepartment of Digital Technology\nManukau Institute of Technology,\nAuckland, New Zealand\nfadi.fayez@manukau.ac.nz\n\n**Data Type**: Multivariate OR Univariate OR Sequential OR Time-Series OR Text OR Domain-Theory\nNominal / categorical, binary and continuous \n\n**Task**: Classification\n\n**Attribute Type**: Categorical, continuous and binary  \n\n**Area**: Medical, health and social science\n\n**Format Type**: Non-Matrix\n\n**Number of Instances (records in your data set)**: 704\n\n**Number of Attributes (fields within each record)**: 21\n\n**Relevant Information**: For Further information about the attributes/feature see below  table.\n\n **Attribute Information**:\n\nAttribute  \tType\tDescription \n\nAge \tNumber \tAge in years \n\nGender \tString \tMale or Female \n\nEthnicity\tString\tList of common ethnicities in text format \n\nBorn with jaundice\tBoolean  (yes or no)\tWhether the case was born with jaundice\n\nFamily member with PDD\tBoolean  (yes or no)\tWhether any immediate family member has a PDD \n\nWho is completing the test\tString \tParent, self, caregiver, medical staff, clinician ,etc.\n\nCountry of residence \tString\tList of countries in text format\n\nUsed the screening app before \tBoolean  (yes or no)\tWhether the user has used a screening app\n\nScreening Method Type \tInteger (0,1,2,3)\tThe type of screening methods chosen based on age category (0=toddler, 1=child, 2= adolescent, 3= adult)\n\nQuestion 1 Answer \tBinary (0, 1)\tThe answer code of the question based on the screening method used  \n\nQuestion 2 Answer \tBinary (0, 1)\tThe answer code of the question based on the screening method used  \n\nQuestion 3 Answer \tBinary (0, 1)\tThe answer code of the question based on the screening method used  \n\nQuestion 4 Answer \tBinary (0, 1)\tThe answer code of the question based on the screening method used  \n\nQuestion 5 Answer \tBinary (0, 1)\tThe answer code of the question based on the screening method used  \n\nQuestion 6 Answer \tBinary (0, 1)\tThe answer code of the question based on the screening method used  \n\nQuestion 7 Answer \tBinary (0, 1)\tThe answer code of the question based on the screening method used  \n\nQuestion 8 Answer \tBinary (0, 1)\tThe answer code of the question based on the screening method used  \n\nQuestion 9 Answer \tBinary (0, 1)\tThe answer code of the question based on the screening method used  \n\nQuestion 10 Answer \tBinary (0, 1)\tThe answer code of the question based on the screening method used  \n\nScreening Score \tInteger \tThe final score obtained based on the scoring algorithm of the screening method used.
