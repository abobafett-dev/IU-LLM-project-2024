  "descriptionNullable": "Bidoo is Italy's largest and most publicized online auction company! It provides a platform for people to bid on a wide variety of items, from antique furniture to the latest electronics, at often advantageous and highly discounted prices.\n\nThe auctions at Bidoo are conducted in a unique way. To participate in an auction, users must first purchase Bidoo virtual coins, which have a dynamic price that can change depending on the desired amount and the demand for them. Then, they can decide whether to bid in manual mode, where they are asked to actively interact with the platform, or in automatic mode, where they can set some categories of interest and the maximum number of coins they are willing to bid, leaving Bidoo's automated bots to handle the rest. The auctions are open from 12 PM to midnight, CET time, allowing users to bid on items throughout the day. If an auction isn't closed before midnight, it will be frozen and restarted the next day from where it left off. All auctions start from a common price, but each can have a different timer. Every time a user bids a coin on an item, it raises its price by one step and resets the timer to its original set value. When the timer reaches zero, the auction is considered closed, and the latest bidder wins the item. All won items can be shipped to the user's home or redeemed as coins.\n\nThe metaparameters regarding bid cost and step, and the starting price are available in the `config.json` file.\n\nThe dataset contains records of about 50k closed auctions from early 2022, scraped from Bidoo's platform. Each record reports the end information about the auction and the winner, but not the auction history. The records were anonymized for privacy concerns by blurring or removing all personally identifiable information (PII) and quasi-identifiers. This is to protect the privacy of the users and ensure that the data can be used in a responsible and ethical manner. The fuzzy categories to which all items on Bidoo belong are reported in `categories.txt` as from Bidoo itself. The records are devoid of the category information, but it should be recoverable, e.g., using some kind of semantic similarity between the item description and all categories. For more information on the dataset, see the schema.\n\nAs for the `name` column, it was translated to English with this [model](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-tc-big-it-en) part of the [OPUS-MT project](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/Opus-MT). Any errors are due to the translation process.\n\nFor information on how to reproduce the scraping and pre-processing steps, see the notebooks in [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/DiTo97/bidoo-closed-auctions).\n\nThe purposes of the dataset are many. For buyers, it allows them to see the historical prices of items they are interested in and determine if bidding in an auction is likely to be advantageous. For sellers, it provides insights into the demand for certain items and allows them to price their items accordingly. Our hope is that the dataset will inspire lots of creative ideas for analysis and modeling purposes, such as 1) identifying trends in pricing, 2) determining which items are most popular, 3) determining patterns within different price ranges, 4) developing predictive models for future auction outcomes or 5) detecting potential fraudulent activities (e.g., users that often win without bidding a lot of coins). Another interesting direction would be to determine whether even winning an auctioned item is beneficial for the winner. This is why we added winner expenses to the dataset, accounting for shipping expenses, the number of coins the winner bid in the auction, and metaparameters. Although our dataset of closed auctions is still relatively small, we may decide to enrich it with data from future auctions.\n\nWhile the dataset is currently limited, we believe that it will serve as a useful resource for researchers and analysts interested in understanding the inner dynamics of online auctions and look forward to sharing our findings in the future.\n",
