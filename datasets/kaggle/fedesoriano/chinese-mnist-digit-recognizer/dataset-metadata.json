Each participant wrote with a standard black ink pen all 15 numbers in a table with 15 designated regions drawn on a white A4 paper. This process was repeated 10 times with each participant. Each sheet was scanned with a resolution of 300x300 pixels.\nIt resulted in a dataset of 15000 images, each representing one character from a set of 15 characters (grouped in samples, grouped in suites, with 10 samples/volunteer and 100 volunteers).\n\n#### Further Data Processing\n\nThe project was originally downloaded from the [original project page](https://data.ncl.ac.uk/articles/dataset/Handwritten_Chinese_Numbers/10280831/1) the raw images. \nThis dataset is the CSV version of the original dataset uploaded to Kaggle by [Gabriel Preda](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda). The original Chinese MNIST dataset uploaded by him can be found at the following [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/chinese-mnist). The only difference is that this dataset contains all the images and labels in the same unique file.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset contains the following:\n\n- a unique CSV file: chineseMNIST.csv\n\nThis file contains the 15000 observations and 4098 columns. Columns 1 to 4096 represent each pixel of the image (64x64). The last two columns denote the value label and the original Chinese character.
