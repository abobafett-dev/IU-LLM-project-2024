Women are generally considered to be paid less than men. There are two distinct numbers regarding the pay gap: non-adjusted versus adjusted pay gap. The latter typically takes into account differences in hours worked, occupations were chosen, education, and job experience. In the United States, for example, the non-adjusted average female's annual salary is 79% of the average male salary, compared to 95% for the adjusted average salary.\n\nThe reasons link to legal, social, and economic factors, and extend beyond \"equal pay for equal work\".\n\nThe gender pay gap can be a problem from a public policy perspective because it reduces economic output and means that women are more likely to be dependent upon welfare payments, especially in old age.\n\nThis dataset aims to replicate the data used in the famous paper ***\"The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations\"***, which provides new empirical evidence on the extent of and trends in the gender wage gap, which declined considerably during the 1980\u20132010 period.\n\n\n### Citation\n\n&gt; fedesoriano.

THE fz variables WERE USED IN THE REGRESSION ANALYSES\nTHE VARIABLES WITH A **predict** PREFIX REFER TO THE COMPUTATION OF ACTUAL EXPERIENCE ACCUMULATED DURING THE YEARS IN WHICH THE PSID DID NOT SURVEY THE RESPONDENTS. THERE ARE MORE PREDICTED EXPERIENCE LEVELS THAT ARE NEEDED TO IMPUTE EXPERIENCE IN THE MISSING YEARS IN SOME CASES.\nNOTE THAT THE VARIABLES **yrsexpf, yrsexpfsz, etc.**, INCLUDE THESE COMPUTATIONS, SO THAT IF YOU WANT TO USE FULL TIME OR PART TIME EXPERIENCE, YOU DON\u2019T NEED TO ADD THESE PREDICT VARIABLES IN. THEY ARE INCLUDED IN THE DATA SET TO ILLUSTRATE THE RESULTS OF THE COMPUTATION PROCESS.\nTHE VARIABLES WITH AN **orig** PREFIX ARE THE ORIGINAL PSID VARIABLES. THESE HAVE BEEN PROCESSED AND IN SOME CASES RENAMED FOR CONVENIENCE. THE **hd** SUFFIX MEANS THAT THE VARIABLE REFERS TO THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY, AND THE **wf** SUFFIX MEANS THAT IT REFERS TO THE WIFE OR FEMALE COHABITOR IF THERE IS ONE. AS SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING REGRESSION PROGRAM, THESE orig VARIABLES AREN\u2019T USED DIRECTLY IN THE REGRESSIONS. THERE ARE MORE OF THE ORIGINAL PSID VARIABLES, WHICH WERE USED TO CONSTRUCT THE VARIABLES USED IN THE REGRESSIONS. HD MEANS HEAD AND WF MEANS WIFE OR FEMALE COHABITOR.\n\n\n\n1. intnum68: 1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER\n1. pernum68: PERSON NUMBER 68\n1. wave: Current Wave of the PSID\n1. sex: gender SEX OF INDIVIDUAL (1=male, 2=female)\n1. intnum: Wave-specific Interview Number\n1. farminc: Farm Income\n1. region: regLab Region of Current Interview\n1. famwgt: this is the PSID\u2019s family weight, which is used in all analyses\n1. relhead: ER34103L this is the relation to the head of household (10=head; 20=legally married wife; 22=cohabiting partner)\n1. age: Age\n1. employed: ER34116L Whether or not employed or on temp leave (everyone gets a 1 for this variable, since our wage analyses use only the currently employed)\n1. sch: schLbl Highest Year of Schooling\n1. annhrs: Annual Hours Worked\n1. annlabinc: Annual Labor Income\n1. occ: 3 Digit Occupation 2000 codes\n1. ind: 3 Digit Industry 2000 codes\n1. white: White, nonhispanic dummy variable\n1. black: Black, nonhispanic dummy variable\n1. hisp: Hispanic dummy variable\n1. othrace: Other Race dummy variable\n1. degree: degreeLbl Agent's Degree Status (0=no college degree; 1=bachelor\u2019s without advanced degree; 2=advanced degree)\n1. degupd: degreeLbl Agent's Degree Status (Updated with 2009 values)\n1. schupd: schLbl Schooling (updated years of schooling)\n1. annwks: Annual Weeks Worked\n1. unjob: unJobLbl Union Coverage dummy variable\n1. usualhrwk: Usual Hrs Worked Per Week\n1. labincbus: Labor Income from Business\n1. yrsexp: Experience\n1. yrsftexp: FT Experience\n1. yrsptexp: PT Experience\n1. yrsptexpsq: PT Experience^2\n1. yrsftexpsq: FT Experience^2\n1. yrsExpSq: Experience^2\n1. yrsexpfz: Experience (filling in zeros)\n1. yrsftexpfz: FT Experience (filling in zeros)\n1. yrsptexpfz: Years of Part-Time Experience (Filling in zeros)\n1. yrsexpfzsq: Experience^2 (filling in zeros)\n1. yrsftexpfzsq: FT Experience^2 (filling in zeros)\n1. wtrgov: Works in Government (dummy variable)\n1. selfemp: selfEmpLbl =1 If Self Employed for ANY Job in the Current Wave.

Women are generally considered to be paid less than men. There are two distinct numbers regarding the pay gap: non-adjusted versus adjusted pay gap. The latter typically takes into account differences in hours worked, occupations were chosen, education, and job experience. In the United States, for example, the non-adjusted average female's annual salary is 79% of the average male salary, compared to 95% for the adjusted average salary.\n\nThe reasons link to legal, social, and economic factors, and extend beyond \"equal pay for equal work\".\n\nThe gender pay gap can be a problem from a public policy perspective because it reduces economic output and means that women are more likely to be dependent upon welfare payments, especially in old age.\n\nThis dataset aims to replicate the data used in the famous paper ***\"The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations\"***, which provides new empirical evidence on the extent of and trends in the gender wage gap, which declined considerably during the 1980\u20132010 period.\n\n\n### Citation\n\n&gt; fedesoriano. (January 2022). Gender Pay Gap Dataset. Retrieved [Date Retrieved] from https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/gender-pay-gap-dataset.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThere are 2 files in this dataset: a) the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) microdata over the 1980-2010 period, and b) the Current Population Survey (CPS) to provide some additional US national data on the gender pay gap.\n\n**PSID variables:**\n\n&gt; **NOTES**: THE VARIABLES WITH **fz** ADDED TO THEIR NAME REFER TO EXPERIENCE WHERE WE HAVE FILLED IN SOME ZEROS IN THE MISSING PSID YEARS WITH DATA FROM THE RESPONDENTS\u2019 ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT JOBS WORKED ON DURING THESE MISSING YEARS. THE fz variables WERE USED IN THE REGRESSION ANALYSES\nTHE VARIABLES WITH A **predict** PREFIX REFER TO THE COMPUTATION OF ACTUAL EXPERIENCE ACCUMULATED DURING THE YEARS IN WHICH THE PSID DID NOT SURVEY THE RESPONDENTS. THERE ARE MORE PREDICTED EXPERIENCE LEVELS THAT ARE NEEDED TO IMPUTE EXPERIENCE IN THE MISSING YEARS IN SOME CASES.\nNOTE THAT THE VARIABLES **yrsexpf, yrsexpfsz, etc.**, INCLUDE THESE COMPUTATIONS, SO THAT IF YOU WANT TO USE FULL TIME OR PART TIME EXPERIENCE, YOU DON\u2019T NEED TO ADD THESE PREDICT VARIABLES IN. THEY ARE INCLUDED IN THE DATA SET TO ILLUSTRATE THE RESULTS OF THE COMPUTATION PROCESS.\nTHE VARIABLES WITH AN **orig** PREFIX ARE THE ORIGINAL PSID VARIABLES. THESE HAVE BEEN PROCESSED AND IN SOME CASES RENAMED FOR CONVENIENCE. THE **hd** SUFFIX MEANS THAT THE VARIABLE REFERS TO THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY, AND THE **wf** SUFFIX MEANS THAT IT REFERS TO THE WIFE OR FEMALE COHABITOR IF THERE IS ONE. AS SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING REGRESSION PROGRAM, THESE orig VARIABLES AREN\u2019T USED DIRECTLY IN THE REGRESSIONS. THERE ARE MORE OF THE ORIGINAL PSID VARIABLES, WHICH WERE USED TO CONSTRUCT THE VARIABLES USED IN THE REGRESSIONS.
