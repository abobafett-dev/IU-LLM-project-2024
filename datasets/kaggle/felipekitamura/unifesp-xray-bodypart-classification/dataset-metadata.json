In many hospitals, when a physician orders multiple imaging exams one accession number is created for each body part (eg. knee, ankle, and leg), but the registration for the correspondent images are often incorrect within each accession number, here is an example:\n\n![RIS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kitamura-felipe/competitions/main/RIS.png)\n\nThe image above shows exams from a unique patient acquired on the same day - knee, leg, hip, ankle, tight, and pelvis -  but when you look at Image Count, only the knee entry has images and the other entries are left empty.\nThat is a major concern because if you want to extract a knee dataset from PACS filtering by the Study Description, you will often extract exams with multiple body parts and sometimes extract empty exams. Also, if you create a model to classify some diseases in one body part, model deployment in clinical practice will be almost impossible. For one thing, imagine we created a model to detect pneumonia in chest x-rays. To deploy that model we need to ensure we only get chest x-rays. Otherwise, we may end up trying to diagnose pneumonia from a skull x-ray, which does not make any sense.\nThe algorithm you are challenged to create should be able to automate the identification of the body part in the image, making it possible to create more datasets and deploy pipelines.\n\n## Useful resources\n\n* Pydicom - A extremely useful library in Python that helps you handle DICOM format files. - https://pydicom.github.io/\n* DICOM  - The DICOM website can have multiple information on DICOM metadata and how it can affect the display of an image(eg.
