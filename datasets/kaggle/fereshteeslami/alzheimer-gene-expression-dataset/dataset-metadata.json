  "descriptionNullable": "\nThis dataset contains gene expression data from individuals with varying degrees of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and from healthy individuals. The hippocampal gene expression of nine control subjects and 22 AD subjects was analyzed using 31 separate microarrays. The correlation between each gene's expression and the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) scores was then tested across all 31 subjects, regardless of their diagnosis. These tests revealed a significant transcriptional response involving thousands of genes that were strongly correlated with AD markers. Additionally, several hundred of these genes were also correlated with AD markers in only control and early-stage AD subjects (MMSE &gt; 20). This dataset is valuable for identifying potential genes involved in AD and for diagnosing the disease using highly associated markers. However, the dataset contains 13147 genes (features) instead of just 31 samples, which presents a challenge due to the curse of dimensionality. This makes it difficult to implement machine learning and deep learning models, and dimensional reduction should be applied first.\n\n\nMissing attribute values: None\n\nClass Distribution: Sever (7/31), Moderate (8/31), Incipient (7/31), Control (9/31)\n\nContributors: Eric M Blalock, James Geddes, Kuey-Chu Chen, Nada Porter, William Markesbery, Philip Landfield\n\nDatabase weblink = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo",
