Data is gathered from three different museums:\n - The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York.\n - The Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n - The Cleveland Museum of Art.\n\nData from all museums is aggregated by art experts into 29 classes of mediums (i.e., materials and techniques).\n\nThe MAMe dataset is originaly introduced in this [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13693). Although here in the kaggle platform we only provide a 256x256 images version of the dataset, the original MAMe dataset with high-resolution images of variable shape can be download from its oficial [website](https://hpai.bsc.es/MAMe-dataset/). Additionally, a set of baseline models and code used to train them is available in the oficial github [repository](https://github.com/HPAI-BSC/MAMe-baselines).\n\n### Acknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Gema Campo & Nina Viladrich for their collaboration on the development of the MAMe dataset. Also thank Eduard Gimenez & David Puiggr\u00f2s for their support on the publication of the dataset in this platform.",
