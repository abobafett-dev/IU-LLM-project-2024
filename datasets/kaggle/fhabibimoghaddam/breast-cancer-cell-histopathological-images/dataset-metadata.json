Routine histology uses the stain combination of **hematoxylin and eosin, commonly referred to as H&E**. These images are stained since most cells are essentially transparent, with little or no intrinsic pigment. Certain special stains, which bind selectively to particular components, are be used to identify biological structures such as cells. In those images, the challenging problem is cell segmentation for subsequent classification in benign and malignant cells.\n\n*E. Drelie Gelasca, J. Byun, B. Obara and B. S.
