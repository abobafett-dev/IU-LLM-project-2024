  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset provides a regional detailed overview of the Brazil digital music consumption in Spotify between 2021-2023. It includes acoustic features and all genres/artists that are listened at least one time in those years. The data is provided by the [Spotify API for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) and the [SpotifyCharts](https://charts.spotify.com/charts/overview/global) wich are used to collect the acoustic features and the summarized most listened songs in city, respectively.\n\n# Data description\nIt contemplates 17 cities of 16 different states in Brazil that achieved 5190 unique tracks, 487 different genres and 2056 artists. The covered cities are: Bel\u00e9m, Belo Horizonte, Bras\u00edlia, Campinas, Campo Grande, Cuiab\u00e1, Curitiba, Florian\u00f3polis, Fortaleza, Goi\u00e2nia, Manaus, Porto Alegre, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, S\u00e3o Paulo and Uberl\u00e2ndia. Each city has 119 different weekly's charts wich the week period is described by the file name.\n\n## Acoustic features\nThe covered acoustic features are provided by Spotify and are described as:\n- **Acousticness:** Measures from 0.0 to 1.0 of wheter the track is acoustic; 1.0 indicates a totally acoustic song and 0.0 means a song without any acoustic element\n- **Danceability:** Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\n- **Energy:** is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.\n- **Instrumentalness:** Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. \"Ooh\" and \"aah\" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly \"vocal\". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.\n- **Key:** The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard [Pitch Class notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class). E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C\u266f/D\u266d, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.\n- **Liveness:** Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\n- **Loudness:** The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.\n- **Mode:** Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\n- **Speechiness:** Detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.\n- **Tempo:** The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n- **Time Signature:** An estimated time signature. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure). The time signature ranges from 3 to 7 indicating time signatures of \"3/4\", to \"7/4\".\n- **Valence:** A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n\n# Data Science Applications:\n- **Time Series Analysis:** Identify seasonal behaviors and the deviation of each city during those 2 years\n- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns and trends in digital music consumption based in genres and/or acoustic features in each city to understand seasonal changes\n- **Clustering Tasks:** Group cities based on genre and/or acoustic features to identify different regional patterns between Brazil's regions and describe the difference between each group\n",
