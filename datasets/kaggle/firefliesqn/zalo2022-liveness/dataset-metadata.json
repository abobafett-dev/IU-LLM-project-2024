Liveness detection is the AI problem to answer that question.\n\nIn this challenge, participants will build a liveness detection model to classify if a given facial video is real or spoofed.\n\nTraining data:\n1168 videos of faces with facemask, in which 598 are real and 570 are fake.\n\nLabel file (Label.CSV) in which each row provides a video name and its label (0 = Fake, 1 = Real).\n\nTesting data:\nPublic test: 350 videos of faces with facemask, without label file.\n\nPrivate test: 600 videos of faces with facemask, without label file.\n\nSubmission:\nEach test video is predicted with one score in [0...1] (0 = Fake, 1 = Real).\n\nThe predicted results are required to be put into a CSV file (predict.CSV), in which each row provides a video file name and its predicted liveness score (similar to the given label file in the training set).\n\n \n\nTrain data: https://dl-challenge.zalo.ai/liveness-detection/train.zip\n\nPublic test: https://dl-challenge.zalo.ai/liveness-detection/public_test.zip\n\nLast update: 11:35 AM, 04/11/2022\n",
