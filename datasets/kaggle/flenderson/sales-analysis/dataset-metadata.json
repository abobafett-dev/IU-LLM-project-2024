Each row in the file represents one product. \n\nIt is important to note that we have MANY products in our inventory, and very few of them tend to sell (only about 10% sell each year) and many of the products only have a single sale in the course of a year.\n\n\n# Content\n\nThe file contains historical sales data (identified with the column titled File_Type) along with current active inventory that is in need of evaluation (i.e., File Type = \"Active\"). The historical data shows sales for the past 6 months. The binary target (1 = sale, 0 = no sale in past six months) is likely the primary target that should drive the analysis. \n\nThe other columns contain numeric and categorical attributes that we deem relevant to sales. \n\nNote that some of the historical sales SKUs are ALSO included in the active inventory. \n\nA few comments about the attributes included, as we realize we may have some attributes that are unnecessary or may need to be explained. \n\n- SKU_number: This is the unique identifier for each product.\n\n- Order: Just a sequential counter. Can be ignored.\n\n- SoldFlag: 1 = sold in past 6 mos. 0 = Not sold\n\n- MarketingType = Two categories of how we market the product.
