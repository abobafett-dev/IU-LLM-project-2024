  "descriptionNullable": "## 1. Context\n\nA variety of research is currently being developed in order to predict the future of the current covid-19 pandemic.\nAmong all models, the SIR and other compartmental models are the main tool for explainable, extrapolation-robust predictions.\n\nOur idea is to provide the community with an extensive set of socio-demographics (and health) indicators, with the aim of explaining/predicting the variability in the pandemic dynamics.\nThere is already a lot of literature covering these kind of indicators, for instance people study *contact matrices*, which account for the typical structure of contacts that various segments of the population have (in short: who has contacts with who?).\n\nHowever we haven't found systematic, Machine-Learning based studies of which indicators most impact the R0 (reproduction number) or other coefficients that are usually fitted to the (time-series) data of infected/hospitalized/deaths/etc.\nThere are some nice initiatives similar to ours that have spawned on kaggle, and have been noticed (see the panel /datasets at https://www.kaggle.com/covid-19-contributions , in particular check out https://www.kaggle.com/jieyingwu/covid19-us-countylevel-summaries#counties.csv).\n\nGiven the variety of indicators we provide here, we expect one should be able to predict the department-to-department variations of the empirical coefficient R0, but also of other rates, such has the rate of the process (infected-&gt;hospitalized), and to some extent, the rates of (hospitalized-&gt;resuscitation), or the rates of ([various states]-&gt; dead).\nThis means the prediction deals both with the spread of the pandemic and the severity of its impact on people's lives and on the health system.\n\nOther data sources, to complete this repo (including worldwide data): https://modcov19.math.cnrs.fr/publicdata/#numeric\n\n## 2. Content\n\nHere we provide a training+test set of 100 'examples': the 100 departments of France (we had to exclude Mayotte for lack of reliable/available data). They can be considered homogeneous in the sense that all indicators have been recorded in the same way (see below). Likewise, the time-series of hospitalized/in resuscitation/returned home/deaths are measured in a consistent way among the different French departments, since procedures and instructions are very similar everywhere. This is the advantage of remaining in a single country (here, France).\n\nThere are **two kind of data** we provide in the files.\n\nThe **static** data is an aggregation of socio-demographics and health indicators taken from the last couple of years (2016-2019). It is mostly curated by INSEE, the French national statistics institution, but INSEE itself is only a statistics-precessing place, and their data comes from other French agencies and from some surveys INSEE performs itself (like the census data).\nIt comes as a single file, but it is actually the result of our concatenation of several databases (7 of them). Each original database has a separate original source that we provide in the metadata. Sometimes this source itself is a link to the INSEE website, which then details which agencies originally produced the data.\nFor several of these files, we had to preprocess data from the city-level into the larger departmental level. All the original files coming from public institutions, and the codes that we used to pre-process them, are available at this gitlab:  https://gitlab.inria.fr/flandes/covid-19-fr-socio-demographics.git\n\n\nThe **time-series** (or dynamic) data comes from *Sant\u00e9 Publique France* (also called *Agence Nationale de Sant\u00e9*, ANS), one of the French Public Health agencies, which gathers data from hospitals and from the Regional Health Agencies (*Agence R\u00e9gionale de Sant\u00e9*, ARS).\nAn additional time-series is the lockdown (*confinement*) level time series, that we produced ourselves (from reading the news, basically). This one is a bit particular, in the sense that it makes no sense to predict it, instead the level of lockdown (which decreases starting on May 5th) impacts the epidemic spread, and can be known in advance.\n\nNote that the static data (many features) comes with feature names that start in a precise, regular way. We defined tags such that post-processing would be easy.\n\n**column names**\n\n- The first tag can be: `Nbre`, `Pop`, `RateIncome`, `RateMedian`, `RatePoverty`, `Rate[whatever]`\n- The other tags are (in this order):\n    - `sex=all`, `sex=F`, `sex=H` (F=Femme=Woman, H=homme=Man)\n    - `age=all`, `agemin=0_agemax=150` (or other values) (arbitrarily, the maximumof agemax is 150 years)\n- The suffix is a description of the feature\n\nThere are *many more features than there are examples* in this data set, which means one has to be **extremely cautious** with **over-fitting**.\n\n\n## 3. Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank INSEE and its partners for providing this wealth of data freely, and people working in the ARS and at ministries for providing the time-series health data.\n\nWe also thank the ministry of research for providing permanent jobs, which allow to work on whatever we want (be 'agile') without the need for any bureaucracy (a.k.a. grant proposals). This kind of permanent jobs allowed for this project to exist (in the case of Fran\u00e7ois Landes).\n\nWe also thank flexible bosses who allow their postdocs to work on side projects.\n(?)\n\nF.L. thanks everyone who contributed to his (very limited) epidemiology cultural background, and indirectly encouraged this project (the ICUBAM team, esp. JP Nadal and Fran\u00e7ois Husson).\n\n#### Credits\n\nProject initiated by **Fran\u00e7ois Landes** and **Victor Alfonso**.\n\n## 4. Inspiration\n\nConcretely, we suggest a **multi-variate regression** (supervised) task.\n\nPrecisely, for several time-series data (#of confirmed cases, #of people in hospitals, #of people in ICUs, #of death in hospitals, etc), we want to forecast the latest 7 days, for each department, based on the data excluding the last 7 days (and using the static data).\nIn that sense, we have a training set with 100 examples (each department), with many more features (411 fixed-time socio-demographics and 5 time-series that cover various numbers of days).\n\nThere are many possibilities to tackle this challenge: from linear or polynomial regressions to LSTMs or transformers, or combining with compartmental models: e.g. attempting to predict the effective reproduction number R0 in each department, for a given level of lockdown... the choice is yours !\n\nThe idea of the challenge is that a model with high prediction accuracy can analyzed after training, so as to reveal the key features that impact most the spread and severity of outcomes of the pandemic. So high prediction accuracy is not so much the goal in itself than a means to achieve the goal.\n\n\n## 5.
