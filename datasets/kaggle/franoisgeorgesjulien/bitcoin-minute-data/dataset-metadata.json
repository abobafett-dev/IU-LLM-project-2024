It provided a wealth of valuable information (pure gold) for those interested in analyzing and understanding the minute-by-minute dynamics of the BTC market. Suitable for Algorithmic Trading, Neural Network, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Statistical Analysis and any kind of predictive analysis.\n\n<br>\n\n### Key Features:\n- **OHLCV Data**: The dataset includes Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume (OHLCV) information, which are essential components for charting and analyzing price movements in the BTC market.\n- **Trade Count**: The number of trades that occurred within each minute, offering insights into trading activity and market participation.\n- **Date Data**: day (object) & hour (int) features \n\n<br> \n\n### Technical Indicators:\n- **Multiple EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages):** These moving averages provide a dynamic view of the market by giving more weight to recent data points, making them particularly responsive to current price movements.\n- **WMA (Weighted Moving Average):** A 14-period WMA offers a moving average that assigns varying weights to each data point in the series, thus providing a different perspective on price trends.\n- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):** MACD, Signal Line, and Histogram are included, offering a comprehensive view of this trend-following momentum indicator, which highlights the relationship between two moving averages.\n- **ATR (Average True Range):** ATR measures market volatility by calculating the average range between high and low prices, making it a valuable tool for assessing price volatility.\n- **HMA (Hull Moving Average):** This weighted moving average is designed to reduce lag and increase responsiveness to price changes, allowing for more timely analysis.\n- **KAMA (Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average):** KAMA is an adaptive moving average that adjusts its speed based on market conditions, providing a more dynamic view of price trends.\n- **CMO (Chande Momentum Oscillator):** The Chande Momentum Oscillator measures price changes relative to the total range of prices over a specified period, facilitating insights into market momentum.\n- **Z-Score**: The Z-Score measures how far a data point is from the mean in terms of standard deviations, helping to identify extreme deviations from the norm.\n- **QStick**: QStick measures momentum based on the difference between the opening and closing prices, allowing for a deeper understanding of price movements within each minute.",
