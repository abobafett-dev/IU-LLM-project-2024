  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset consists of a total of 8,125 images of 13 micro-PCBs in high resolution.  The average size of all images is 1949\u00d72126 (width\u00d7height).  The micro-PCBs were captured in 25 different positions relative to the camera under ideal lighting conditions.  In each position, each micro-PCB was captured in 5 different rotations. This creates 125 unique orientations of each micro-PCB relative to the camera. Each unique orientation was captured 4 times and coded for training and then another micro-PCB of the same make and model was captured once and coded for testing. Thus, no micro-PCB that is used in training is the same that is used in testing. Although the micro-PCBs coded for training are nearly identical to those coded for testing, very subtle differences exist in some cases. In total, each micro-PCB in the dataset has 500 training images and 125 test images, creating an overall train/test split of 6,500/1,625.",
