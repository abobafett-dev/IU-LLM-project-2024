  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nYellow sticky traps are used in agricultural greenhouses to monitor the spread and intensity of insects. In Europe *Trialeurodes vaporariorum* and *Bemisia tabaci* (greenhouse whitefly) in tomatoes are listed in the top 10 of the most problematic pests in greenhouse vegetable crops. Insects can be attracted and monitored on these traps. Counting and classification of insects is time-consuming and error-prone as it is only partly automated (or still counted by hand) by classical thresholding and blob counting algorithms. Growers can apply integrated pest management strategies based on the insect pressure in their greenhouse. \n\n\n### Content\n\nThe content is 284 images 3456 x 5184 and 5184 x 3456. Each images is annoted with LabelImg. There are 3 classes to consider:\n\nIn total 1312 Macrolophus MR have been annotated\n\nIn total 510 Nesidiocoris NC have been annotated\n\nIn total 5591 Whiteflies WF have been annotated\n\nThere is even a fourth class (TR) *Thysanoptera* but since there are limited annotations you can disregard that one.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe data is published by 4TU: a collaboration of 4 technical universities in the Netherlands. The dataset can be found [here](https://data.4tu.nl/repository/uuid:8b8ba63a-1010-4de7-a7fb-6f9e3baf128e) together with the corresponding articles. \nThis dataset is part of the ERANet research programme C-IPM and the project PeMaToEuroPep. The data collection here was funded by the Dutch research organization NWO and the Dutch Topsector Tuinbouw en Uitgangsmaterialen \n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThe 4TU researchers got a precision of  87.4%.
