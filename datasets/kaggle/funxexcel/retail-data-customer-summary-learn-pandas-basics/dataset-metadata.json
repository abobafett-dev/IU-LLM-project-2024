Each customers transaction amount and number of transactions information is present in a separate column (or unpivoted). Also, the data contains its first and last transaction date. \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nTo be added. \n\n\n### Inspiration \n\nI was inspired by creating contextual questions that will help students learn Pandas faster.
