Each tile was then labeled with the most relevant category in Label Studio. Not all of the original ~3000 images were taken and not all tiles were taken to save time and because many are redundant, having only very small differences.\n\nUpdate Frequency: Likely never, as the original photographs are not diverse enough to warrant further tagging in my opinion. If I do more classification datasets in the future they will be placed in different projects.\n\nNote: The data in this set is likely not diverse enough for a general classification of urban areas, and should probably be merged with other datasets of the same category for better results.\n\nLicense: The original photos have been published on the site as Public, and with no further information. Upon a bit of digging it seems the company they came from originally is Transparent Sky LLC but with no link on their own website and it being a very old HTML website, there is no way to tell for certain.",
