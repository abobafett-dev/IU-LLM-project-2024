  "descriptionNullable": "Diverse License Plate Detection - A combination of images from multiple LPD datasets along with negative samples to make the dataset training-ready.\nThe images are from a large number of datasets from Kaggle as well as general internet sources, as will be listed below.\n\nPurpose:\nTraining a YOLOv8 object detection model for license-plate detection.\nSee https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics for pre-trained models.\n\nData:\nThere are about 3100 images of cars with tagged license plates, on the conditions that the plate has at least one recognizable character and is not seen through the glass of another car (or reflection for that matter).\nThere are also about 1500 images which either do not contain cars at all, or contain cars but in such an angle or resolution that their license plate is not detectable. This is to address false positives which I have encountered when using some of the open-source models found on huggingface (ones that were only trained on images with at least one license-plate in them)\n*Update 24/03/2024: Dataset contains 5500 images, see Updates for specifications.*\n\nUpdates:\n**Update 24/03/2024:**\n- After using a different open-source model from huggingface trained on a dataset from roboflow on yolo5 (dataset in list here) we encountered two items of note.\n  - A. The system yielded much better results when using a Yolo8 model to first identify vehicles, and then detect plates on them\n  - B. The dataset on which the yolov5 model was trained on contained almost no negative examples, and contained a lot of duplications.\n- Added some images from a potholes dataset (listed in Sources) to help with disassociate roads with plates, and also get a few more car images.\n- Added images from the roboflow dataset which included images from a parking garage, allowing for a different angle.\n- Added images from a parking sign dataset, few with car images but mostly to disassociate street and road signs from plates found on actual cars.\n- Trained a Yolo8 model on the dataset, but did not run in production and was only really for testing. However the class loss decreased at a much faster rate than when trained with a much larger dataset consisting of very similar (quality, size, locality) positive images, even by epoch 10.\n- *Current plan moving forward: Run transfer learning on Yolo9 with this dataset for somewhere between 100 and 200 epochs (yay for Programmable Gradient Information) and post some of the model results here.*\n\n**Update 25/03/2024** Training update\nSplit dataset into Train, Validation, Test by ratio of 80, 10, 10.\nTrained using the ultralytics library with imgsz=640, batch=16, dropout=0.2 for 150 epochs\nValidation plateaued after about 110 epochs. Out of 100 test photos from real data there were about 5 false positives and 5 false negatives when using this model only, and 2 false positives + 1 false negative when first processing the image through YOLOv8x and filtering for [car, truck, motorcycle, bus]. Currently runs in production on Torchserve.\nFalse positives: Rectangles with lines (like grates)\nFalse negatives: Very low quality images, or images in which the plate was already very small and so disappeared when image was resized to 640.\n\nDiversity:\nThe datasets sampled for this \"diverse\" one contain plates from a variety of countries, but mainly focusing on the ones from this site which are:\n- European (+Russian)\n- American\n- Middle Eastern\n- Indian\n\nSources: (In no particular order)\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amriteshtiwari20/truck-licenseplate-dataset\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gaelcohen/license-plate-israel\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kedarsai/indian-license-plates-with-labels\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedalitrabelsi/tunisiania-license-plate-detection\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrabduqayum/license-plate-detection-yolov5\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akhiljethwa/forest-vs-desert\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/stanford-background-dataset\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhailma/house-rooms-streets-image-dataset\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paulchambaz/google-street-view\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pcmill/license-plates-on-vehicles\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psvishnu/pennfudan-database-for-pedestrian-detection-zip\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rayanechibani/dataset\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yellowj4acket/car-license-plate-detection-yolo-orig-by-larxel\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirhoseinahmadnejad/car-license-plate-detection-iran\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aritrag/license\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshah/license-plate-persian-coco\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/narimanjabbar/dataset-iraq-license-plate\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nuralitileuov/car-license-plate\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saisirishan/indian-vehicle-dataset\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sushankghimire/license-plate\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trainingdatapro/license-plates-1-209-438-ocr-plates\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/truongthanh081203/license-plate\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/pothole-detection\n- https://universe.roboflow.com/augmented-startups/vehicle-registration-plates-trudk/dataset/1\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/san-francisco-parking-sign-detection\n- Internet\n\nIt should be noted, with the size of some of these datasets, not all of the images in the datasets were used, depending on the size and variety in each dataset.\n\nLicense:\nAs specified by the datasets (those that did specify a License and did not specify \"Unknown\")\n- amriteshtiwari20/truck-licenseplate-dataset: MIT\n- kedarsai/indian-license-plates-with-labels: CC0: Public Domain\n- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akhiljethwa/forest-vs-desert: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n- balraj98/stanford-background-dataset: The dataset is derived from Stanford DAGS Lab's Stanford Background Dataset from their Scene Understanding Datasets, see the Acknowledgements section for credits\n- mikhailma/house-rooms-streets-image-dataset: CC0: Public Domain\n- paulchambaz/google-street-view: GNU Lesser General Public License\n- pcmill/license-plates-on-vehicles: CC0 Public Domain\n- psvishnu/pennfudan-database-for-pedestrian-detection-zip: Acknowledgements\n- yellowj4acket/car-license-plate-detection-yolo-orig-by-larxel: CC0 Public Domain\n- amirhoseinahmadnejad/car-license-plate-detection-iran: Database Contents License (DbCL) v1.0\n- aritrag/license: CC0 Public Domain\n- marshah/license-plate-persian-coco: Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International\n- trainingdatapro/license-plates-1-209-438-ocr-plates: Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International\n- truongthanh081203/license-plate: Apache 2.0\n\nNotes on Licenses:\nIf your dataset is included in this list and has a license that could be changed (like CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) please contact me if you'd like your photos removed from the dataset.\n\nAcknowledgements:\nS.
