To make the classification more difficult scenes from a wide range of places were selected, and of various different scenes in each location.\nThere are 1000 images of each class, where the classes were defined as:\n\nInterior: Images that depict the inside of some structure, either a building, car, train, plane, factory, supermarket.\nExterior: Images that depict an open space, either in a forest, on a mountain, or on a balcony, as long as it is not closed by a roof.\n\nOne goal is to create a set for training new models on an abstract concept that is not controlled by a set of objects appearing in an image, since many interior images will not include the ceiling itself in the image.\nThe other goal is to create a test set for testing the ability to use existing models for this classification, using other frameworks for feature extraction, or prompt engineering with Transformer based models.",
