  "descriptionNullable": "The monthly mean temperature data presented in this dataset was obtained from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Global Land Surface Air Temperature Analysis, which was loaded into Python using xarray. The data was then filtered to include only the latitude and longitude coordinates corresponding to each city in the dataset. In order to select the nearest location to each city, the 'select' method with the nearest point was used, resulting in temperature data that may not be exactly at the city location. The data is presented on a 0.5x0.5 degree grid across the globe.\n\nThe temperature data provides a valuable resource for time series analysis, and if you are interested in obtaining temperature data for additional cities, please let me know. I will also be sharing the source code on GitHub for anyone who would like to reproduce the data or analysis.",
