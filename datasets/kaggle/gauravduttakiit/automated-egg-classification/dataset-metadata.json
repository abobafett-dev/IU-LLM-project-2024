These attributes can include factors such as size, color, shape, and potential defects. By utilizing advanced image analysis and pattern recognition, the system can accurately and efficiently differentiate between different egg types, ensuring consistent quality control and optimization in industries such as agriculture, food production, and poultry farming. This automation helps streamline egg sorting processes, minimize human error, and enhance overall productivity within the egg supply chain.",
