Gathering comprehensive social data for sentiment analysis can be limited, however, if data collection relies only on keywords such as \u2018coronavirus\u2019 or \u2018covid\u2019.\n\nThe objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to assess if a Twitter post is about COVID-19 or not. This model will help gather tweet data about the epidemic without relying only on key words like \u2018covid\u2019 or \u2018coronavirus\u2019 being present, allowing researchers and engineers to gather a more comprehensive dataset for sentiment analysis.\n\nThis model could be put into practice as part of a larger effort to understand online sentiment around COVID-19, and inform future communications and public interventions by governments and non-government public health organisations.\n\n\n\nThe objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to assess if a Twitter post is about covid-19 or not.The data used for this challenge has been collected by the Zindi team via Twitter API from tweets over the past year.
