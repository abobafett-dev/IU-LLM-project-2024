They have come up with a diversity of innovations ranging from wearable devices to artificial intelligence systems software. Those that are drawn to the use and derivation of various intelligent systems are already on the step of venturing the fields of neural network and machine learning algorithms, exploring its capabilities to try and classify various human activities, ranging from the different movements and actions that the human body can perform, to the complexities of a hand gesture, down to the most minute kinds of physical action such as the eye movement. \n\n \n\nOne of the devices that has been gaining high traction lately is the availability of wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) headsets in the market. EEG is a device used to read electrical signals produced by the brain while performing different activities ranging from physical, mental to emotional.
