Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).\n\nBut, it\u2019s not always clear whether a person\u2019s words are actually announcing a disaster. Take this example:\n\n\nThe author explicitly uses the word \u201cABLAZE\u201d but means it metaphorically. This is clear to a human right away, especially with the visual aid. But it\u2019s less clear to a machine.\n\nIn this competition, you\u2019re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one\u2019s aren\u2019t. You\u2019ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. If this is your first time working on an NLP problem, we've created a quick tutorial to get you up and running.\n\nDisclaimer: The dataset for this competition contains text that may be considered profane, vulgar, or offensive.",
