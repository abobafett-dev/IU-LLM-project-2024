The insurance sector grapples with an ongoing dilemma in distinguishing genuine claims from deceptive ones, a situation that can result in substantial financial setbacks. The emergence of Generative AI and various stable diffusion models has contributed to a surge in the number of fraudulent claims. It has become commonplace for users to incorporate fraudulent images as components of the claim settlement process.\n\nThis poses a formidable challenge to insurance companies as they strive to differentiate between legitimate and deceitful claims. Deceptive claims often involve amplifying the severity of damage or fabricating entirely false claims. To curb these financial losses and uphold the integrity of their operations, insurance firms must formulate effective approaches for accurately and efficiently flagging fraudulent claims.\n\nIn the context of this hackathon, the WNS team invites the community to devise a robust and high-performance model utilizing computer vision techniques to classify images as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent within the context of insurance claims. By precisely identifying fraudulent images, insurance companies can evaluate the authenticity of a claim and make well-informed decisions regarding payout.\n\nData is available at https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/wns-triange-hackquest/#ProblemStatement\n\n\n",
