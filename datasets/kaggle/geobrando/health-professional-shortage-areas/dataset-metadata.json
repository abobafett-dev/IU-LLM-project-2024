These areas are designated by the [Health Resources and Services Administration](https://www.hrsa.gov/) (HRSA), a federal agency in the United States Department of Health and Human Services. \n\nThere are several types of shortage designations including:\n- Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs)\n- Medically Underserved Areas and Populations (MUAPs)\n- Exceptional Medically Underserved Population (Exceptional MUPs)\n- Governor's-Designated Secretary-Certified Shortage Areas for Rural Health Clinics\n\nHRSA's Bureau of Health Workforce operates a cooperative agreement and evaluates applications submitted by the Primary Care Office (PCO) of each U.S. state and territory as part of the process to designate some types of shortage areas.  These applications are reviewed by HRSA to determine if they meet specific designation criteria which differs by the type of shortage area.  Other shortage area types are automatically designated by federal statute or at the request of a state governor.  Once HPSAs are designated, score is calculated which represents a relative measure of need for health care services for that discipline.  Both HPSAs and MUAPs can be designated to indicate a shortage of primary care services while only HPSAs can be designated to indicate a shortage of dental or mental health services.  Shortage area designations and scores are used by various federal programs for distributing resources.  Some shortage area designations may also be used by state programs. \n\nSee the [shortage designation website ](https://bhw.hrsa.gov/workforce-shortage-areas/shortage-designation)for more information.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe health workforce shortage area data in the included files represent the HPSA and MUAP (including Exceptional MUP) designation information at a single point in time.
