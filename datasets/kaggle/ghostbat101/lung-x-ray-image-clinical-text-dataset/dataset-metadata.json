  "descriptionNullable": "**Description:**\nThis dataset is a rich resource for the study and classification of lung diseases using X-ray images and clinical text data. It is divided into two main folders:\n\n**Annotated Images and Clinical Texts (Main Dataset Folder)**: This folder contains 80,000 annotated X-ray images, organized into eight subfolders corresponding to different lung diseases. Each subfolder has 10,000 images. Each image is accompanied by a CSV file that includes clinical texts with labels, providing a detailed context for each X-ray image.\n\n**Composite Image Data (Merged Data (image+text) Folder)**: This folder mirrors the structure of the first but without the CSV file. Instead, it features composite images that merge the X-ray image with encoded clinical text data. These composite images offer a unique approach by embedding the textual information directly into the visual data.\n\nThe dataset covers the following lung diseases:\n- Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases\n- Higher Density\n- Lower Density\n- Chest Changes\n- Encapsulated Lesions\n- Degenerative Infectious Diseases\n- Normal\n- Mediastinal Changes\n\nThis dual-format dataset supports a variety of machine learning tasks, including image classification, multi-modal learning, and the integration of text and image data for enhanced diagnostic models.\n\nOriginal images were collected from this dataset and then scaled: [X-ray Lung Diseases Images (9 classes)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fernando2rad/x-ray-lung-diseases-images-9-classes) by Fernando Feltrin.\nThe Clinical_text data was created with the help of GPT-3.5 and medical books containing symptoms for each of the lung diseases.",
