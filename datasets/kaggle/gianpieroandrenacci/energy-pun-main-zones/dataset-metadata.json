  "descriptionNullable": "**The PUN (Italian acronym for Prezzo Unico Nazionale, \"National Single Price\")** is the wholesale reference price of electricity purchased on the Borsa Elettrica Italiana market (IPEX - Italian Power Exchange).\n\nThe PUN therefore represents the** national weighted average of the zonal sales** prices of electricity for each hour and for each day.  The national figure is an amount that is calculated on the average of various factors, and which takes into account the quantities and prices formed in the different areas of Italy and at different times of the day.\n\nThe PUN value index is published on the **Energy Markets Manager** website. \n\n**How the PUN affects the price of energy**\nThe wholesale price of electricity is established directly on the market based on the trades between the various players involved, i.e. between producers and energy suppliers (who purchase the energy from producers to supply to their end customers). The fluctuations of the PUN are a determining factor in calculating the final costs of energy in the bill.  In fact, in the periods in which the PUN increases its value, costs tend to rise, to fall instead when the value of the PUN falls. Energy suppliers generally provide for tariffs for the final consumer at a fixed cost or at an indexed cost as regards the price of the energy component.",
