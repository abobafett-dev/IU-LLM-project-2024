Every road user who is not exempt from the toll must then install an On-Board  Unit  (OBU) recording the distance that a lorry travels within Belgium. On average more than 140,000 trucks are detected per working day on the national roads. Each OBU device sends a message approximately every 30 seconds.  Each data record contains an anonymous Identifier (ID resetting every day at 2 a.m. UTC), the Timestamp, the GPS Position (latitude, longitude), the Speed (engine), and the Direction (compass).\nThe  OBU  data require a pre-processing step to predict the traffic conditions at network scale since the trucks recorded positions may refer not only to streets but also to areas where trucks perform the daily activity  (e.g. loading/unloading goods, stopping at depots\u2019 parking slot). In this regard, we first retrieved all the necessary streets from OpenStreetMap with Module osmnx.  Then,  we map the GPS points on their corresponding road segments to obtain only the data belonging to the streets of interest. Finally, we performed a resample at different time granularities where, for each segment and time step, we counted the number of trucks present and their average speed.\n\n## Acknowledgement\nThe data are made available by [Brussels Mobility](https://mobilite-mobiliteit.brussels/en) in the context of the [program icity.brussels](https://icity.brussels/) and the project MOBI-AID (MOBIlity-Advanced Indicators Dashboard), a joint initiative between MLG and [MOBI](https://mobi.research.vub.be/en/home). The MOBI-AID project aims at designing and building this performance monitoring system, by means of a dashboard of advanced mobility indicators that will allow (1) to better understand mobility dynamics in the Brussels Region, (2) to support local authorities in designing suitable and sustainable policies, (3) to assist Brussels, capital of Europe, to be recognized as a model of a Smart Region.\n\n## OBU datasets:\n### Periods\n* from 01/01/2019 to 01/03/2019  \n* from 13/03/2021 to 06/06/2021 \n* from 05/06/2021 to 16/10/2021 \n### Road network\n* Anderlecht commune \n* Brussels region \n* Belgium country \n### Temporal resolution\n* 5 minutes \n* 15 minutes \n* 30 minutes \n* 60 minutes\n### Example: \nAnd\\_05min\\_0101\\_0103_2019.csv --&gt; OBU dataset related to Anderlecht road network with 5 minutes temporal resolution and refering to the period from 01/01/2019 to 01/03/2019.\n\n## Data pre-processing for Time-Series: \n## * [OBU Data Time-Series](https://www.kaggle.com/giobbu/obu-data-preprocessing) ;\n## * [Road Network Graph for Deep Learning](https://road-traffic-graph.onrender.com/)\n## * [Video on DL with OBU data](https://github.com/giobbu/ML-streamlit-apps/tree/main/geo-ML/road-traffic-forecasting-belgium)\n\n##### ----\n##  Example Notebooks\n### EDA:\n#### * [EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/giobbu/eda-obudata) ;\n#### * [Haxagons Grid](https://www.kaggle.com/giobbu/build-grid-from-polygons) .\n### Traffic flow prediction for Belgium's Highways:\n### Deep Learning:\n#### * [simple LSTM](https://www.kaggle.com/giobbu/simple-lstm-tensorflow) ;\n#### * [LSTM encoder decoder](https://www.kaggle.com/giobbu/lstm-encoder-decoder-tensorflow) ;\n### Baseline model:\n#### * [seasonal persistence model (Baseline)](https://www.kaggle.com/giobbu/seasonal-persistence-model) .\n\n\n##### ----\n\n\n\n\n## Research: \n### * A tutorial on traffic forecasting with deep learning  * [Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giovanni-Buroni-2/publication/348930068_A_Tutorial_on_Network-Wide_Multi-Horizon_Traffic_Forecasting_with_Deep_Learning/links/6017c45a92851c2d4d0aa267/A-Tutorial-on-Network-Wide-Multi-Horizon-Traffic-Forecasting-with-Deep-Learning.pdf) * [Github](https://github.com/giobbu/App_Traff_Forecast_DeapLearn)\n\n## References:\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/custom_training\n\n\n",
