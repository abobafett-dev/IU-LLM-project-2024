This dataset is a subset of a larger set of Reddit memes collected over the course of 1 year by scraping posts from dozens of meme orientated Subreddits.

Organised into folders, with a 20/80 train/validation split. Also metadata including the original link, score, number of comments etc for (nearly) all of the images. Note that sometimes exactly the same image appears twice - this is because it was posted to two different Subreddits. \n\n### Acknowledgements\nWeb scraping implemented using [Python Reddit API Wrapper developed by Bryce Boe](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which in turn uses the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api).
