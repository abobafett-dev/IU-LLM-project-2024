  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\nI own a dog grooming business. A lot of customers don't know the breed of their dog. I am no expert either so I developed an AI program that can identify the breed of a dog from a photo. It works well for pure bred dogs and also seems to work reasonably well for mixed breeds. For each prediction I list the probability of the most likely breed and the probability of the next most likely breed. I tried  that on my dog who is a mix of a Rottweiler and a Doberman. It came back that there as a 62% probability it was a Rottweiler and a 28% probability it was a Doberman.\n\n\n### Content\n\nData was gathered from internet searches on a specific dog breed. Images were than downloaded and checked for accuracy as not all the images you get in a search are correct. Then the downloaded images were scanned for duplicates using a duplicate image detection program I developed. All duplicates were removed to prevent any images being duplicate across the test, train and validation sets. Images were then resized to 224 X 224 X 3 and put in jpg format.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe wouldn't be here without the help of others. If you owe any attributions or thanks, include them here along with any citations of past research.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI would like to know how well this program works for cross breed dogs. If you have a cross breed dog and know the mixture let me know how it works out.",
