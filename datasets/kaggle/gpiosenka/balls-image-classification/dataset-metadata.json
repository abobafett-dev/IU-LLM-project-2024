There are 30 different types (classes) . train set includes 3615  files in 30 subdirectories, one for each type of ball.\nThe training set is not balanced having a different number of images for each class. This was done intentionally so notebook developers could test methods to deal with unbalanced data. The data set is however of high quality where the region of interest (ROI), the ball typically comprises about 50% of the pixels.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe wouldn't be here without the help of others.
