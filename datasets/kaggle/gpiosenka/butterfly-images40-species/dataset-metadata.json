The butterflies and moths .csv file consists of 4 columns with 13595 rows. The first row is the header, the remaining rows are for each of the image files in the train, test and validation datasets,\nThe columns are class id, filepaths, labels and data set. The filepaths column contains the relative path to the image.\nThe labels column contains the text species label associated with the image file.
