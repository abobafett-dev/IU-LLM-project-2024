  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset is a resized version of the original dataset Coffee Bean Dataset Version 1    \nThe original dataset is located [at ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sot2542/coffee-bean-dataset-v1)  \nRoasted coffee beans have been roasted at JJ Mall Jatujak\u2019s, \u201cBona Coffee.\u201d There are four roasting levels. The green or un-roasted coffee beans are Laos Typica Bolaven (Coffea arabica). Laos Typica Bolaven is a lightly roasted coffee bean (Coffea arabica). Doi Chaang (Coffea Arabica) is medium roasted, whereas Brazil Cerrado is dark roasted (Coffea Arabica). The coffee bean photos are captured with an IPhone12Mini with a 12-megapixel back camera, Ultra-wide, and WideCamera. The camera is set at a location with a plane parallel to the object\u2019s path when photographs are being captured. Images of roasted coffee beans are captured in a variety of settings to validate a wide range of roasted coffee bean image inputs. This experiment employs both LED light from a light box and natural light to shoot the dataset; then the image\u2019s noise is enhanced by putting each variety of coffee beans in a container. Images are automatically collected and saved in PNG format. Each example bean\u2019s image is 3024x3032 pixels in size. In each example, the bean\u2019s image is 3024x3032 pixels in size. There are 4800 photos in total, classified in 4 degrees of roasting. There are 1200 photos under each degree.  \n  \n# Citation\nIf this dataset helped your research, please cite:\nOntoum, S., Khemanantakul, T., Sroison, P., Triyason, T., & Watanapa, B. (2022).
