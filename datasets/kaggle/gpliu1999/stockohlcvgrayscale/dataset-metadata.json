The data used to draw the image comes from the Chinese A-share market.\nYou need to divide the training and test sets yourself and train a machine learning model for this classification task. A very high portfolio Sharpe ratio is reported in the Xiu (2020) paper, and hopefully you will make a fortune from it.",
