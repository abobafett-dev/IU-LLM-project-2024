I use a relevant search term  for the topic (#Tokyo2020).\n\n### Data collection frequency\n\nThe data is collected continuously using a script that collects a small number of recent tweets (using **Twitter API** and **tweepy**), waits for a predefined time (currently set to 2 min) and restart the process. The dataset obtained at each sampling time step is merged with current (or previously collected) dataset and stored dataset in **csv** format is saved on disk. The script is running on **Google Cloud** on a small **Jupyter instance**. Once or several times per day the currently accumulated dataset is uploaded on Kaggle as a new version of the tweets dataset.\n\n## Inspiration\n\nYou can perform multiple operations on the Tokyo Olympics 2020 tweets. Here are few possible suggestions:\n\n* Study the subjects of recent tweets about the Tokyo Olympics;  \n* Perform various NLP tasks on this data source (topic modelling, sentiment analysis);\n* Can you identify tweets about certain sports, countries, athletes?\n* Follow the trends in the news about the Olympics.\n* Perform sentiment analysis on the tweets corpus but also split on sports, countries etc.\n* Study the hashtags (associated to the tweets) distribution.",
