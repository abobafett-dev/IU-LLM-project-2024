  "descriptionNullable": "Historically, research in traffic and incidents has proceeded along two distinct but intrinsically linked tracks. The traffic domain has focused on enhancing deep learning models to incrementally improve prediction accuracy, while the incident track has predominantly concentrated on isolated studies of incident risks and patterns. For the first time, our XTraffic dataset integrates these two tracks both spatially and temporally across a comprehensive regional scale, encompassing 16,972 traffic nodes for the entire year of 2023. The dataset includes detailed time-series data on traffic flow, lane occupancy, and average vehicle speed, as well as meticulously aligned records of incidents across seven different classes, synchronized with the traffic data. Each node also features extensive physical and policy-level meta-attributes of lanes.",
