What year was the most successful from this point of view? What can you conclude if you look at the number of video games released by country?\n- on what day and month were the largest number of video games released? What could be the reason for this pattern?\n- is there a dependence of the number of copies sold on the ratings of critics or users?\n- which gaming platforms, publishers and developers are the most common (the largest number of video games have been released over time)?\n- which gaming platforms, publishers and developers have the largest number of video game copies sold (over all time, the total number of copies sold was the largest)?\n\nIf you have enough experience, try solving a regression problem. Train a model that can predict the number of copies sold of video games:\n- what signs can be used to prevent leakage of the target variable?\n- how do outliers affect the quality of the model?\n- which metric should be chosen to evaluate the model?\n- can adding new data improve the predictive ability of the model?\n- does the trained model have signs of heteroscedasticity of the residuals? How does this affect the predictive ability of the model? What can you do?\n\n# Field descriptions:\n\nThe data contains the following fields:\n1. **name** \u2013 name of the video game.\n2. **date** - release date of the video game.\n3. **platform** - gaming platform (**All** \u2013 all gaming platforms, **Series** \u2013 all video game series).\n4. **publisher** \u2013 publisher.\n5. **developers** - developer.\n6. **shipped** - the number of copies sent (relevant for records with the values **All** and **Series** in the **platform** field).\n7. **total** - total number of copies sold (millions of copies).\n8. **america** - number of copies sold in America (millions of copies).\n9. **europe** - number of copies sold in Europe (millions of copies).\n10. **japan** - number of copies sold in Japan (millions of copies).\n11. **other** - other sales in the world.\n12. **vgc** - rating VGChartz.com.\n13. **critic** - critics' assessment.\n14. **user** - user rating.\n\n# Found an error or inaccuracy in the data?\n\nThis dataset is the result of painstaking work.
