  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset comprises surface electromyography (sEMG) recordings acquired for myoelectric control applications. Collected using the Myo Armband device, the dataset encompasses ten distinct hand motion classes. These recordings serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the fields of biomedical signal processing, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. The dataset's accessibility and diversity make it suitable for training, testing, and optimizing sEMG-based hand gesture recognition algorithms. By sharing this dataset, we aim to foster advancements in myoelectric control technologies and contribute to the development of more intuitive and efficient human-machine interfaces.",
