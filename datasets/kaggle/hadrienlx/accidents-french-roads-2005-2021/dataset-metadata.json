It contains informations about the passengers, the vehicles, and the accidents location and characteristics.

Non-categorical data (e.g. the `age` and `nbv` columns) are already normalized, and the sine and cosine of the month, time of week and time of day has been extracted from the original data to allow for cyclical analysis and detection of cyclical patterns (i.e. evening, week-end, etc.).",
