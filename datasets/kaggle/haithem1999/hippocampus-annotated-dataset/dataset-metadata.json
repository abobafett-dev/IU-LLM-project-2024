Patients were recruited from the Vanderbilt Psychotic Disorders Program and controls were recruited from the surrounding community. All participants were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV . All subjects were free from significant medical or neurological illness, head injury, and active substance use or dependence.\nStructural images were acquired with a 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (TI/TR/TE, 860/8.0/3.7 ms; 170 sagittal slices; voxel size, 1.0 mm3). All images were collected on a Philips Achieva scanner (Philips Healthcare, Inc., Best,The Netherlands). Manual tracing of the head, body, and tail of the hippocampus on images was completed following a previously published protocol .\n\nFor the purposes of this dataset, the term hippocampus includes the hippocampus proper (CA1-4 and dentate gyrus) and parts of the subiculum, which together are more often termed the hippocampal formation . The last slice of the head of the hippocampus was defined as the coronal slice containing the uncal apex. The resulting 195 labeled images are referred to as hippocampus atlases. Note that the term hippocampus posterior refers to the union of the body and the tail.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nCitations: https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09063",
