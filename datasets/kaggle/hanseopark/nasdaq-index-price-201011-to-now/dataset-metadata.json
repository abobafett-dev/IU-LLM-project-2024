I think that just knowing the meaning of the variables without interpreting this dataset is enough to study.\nThis data is an Nasdaq index, taken from yahoo finance. Contains multiple financial statements and represents prices over a period of about 10 years(2010-01-01 - 2021-06-30)\nwe can analyze price of stocks by time series with comparing financial statements that it is expected to be good measurement of correlation! Have you fun!\ud83c\udf89 \n\nThe data format is received as json and can be used as a data frame.\nThe script used can be checked at [Github repository](https://github.com/hanseopark/Stock) and if you want longer time scale data or up-to-date data, please run the script from the link.\nAnd also, if you want another list of stock, you should check the link which can analysis like [Dow](https://www.kaggle.com/hanseopark/dow-stocks-value-and-financial-statement) (tickers are 30), [S&P500](https://www.kaggle.com/hanseopark/sp-500-stocks-value-with-financial-statement) (ticker are 500).\n\n\nIf you interest this data and code, Pleases see notebooks of strategy :)\n\nI'm still learning Python, so if you find messy code execution or have a better way of doing it, let me know!! and Please contact me :) I think it will be a good study.\n\n### Content\n\n- In FS\\_nasdaq\\_Value.json(csv)\nIt is presented by price like 'Open', 'Close' and so on.\n\n- In FS\\_nasdaq\\_Recent+Value.json(csv)\nIt is presented by recent price (2021-06-30)\n\nAll data is presented recently. If you want the statements before, Pleases check and fix below code.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI'm studying physics and writing code of python and c++. However I'm not used to it yet and also English :(. \nLet you know if it is not correctly for code and English :\ud83d\ude4f \n\n\n### Inspiration\nIn interpreting the stock market, there are traditionally low PER and PBR strategies. Prior to this, an ML model using various statements and a price estimation model using time series data have been proposed recently, but we know that they are of little use.\nThis data is highly likely to be used for various analyzes, and it is considered to be basic data for understanding the stock's market.\nLet's study together and find the best model!\n\nIf you are satisfied in data and code, please upvote :)\ud83d\udc4d",
