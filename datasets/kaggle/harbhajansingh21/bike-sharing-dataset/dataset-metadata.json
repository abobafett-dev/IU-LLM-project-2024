This innovation allows users to easily rent bikes from one location and conveniently return them at another.

Unlike other modes of transport like buses or subways, bike sharing systems record precise details such as travel duration and specific departure and arrival positions.

For instance, query like \"2012-10-30 Washington D.C.\" in Google returns related results to Hurricane Sandy.
