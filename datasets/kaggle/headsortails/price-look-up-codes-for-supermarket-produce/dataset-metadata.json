  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nSupermarkets around the world use [Price Look Up Codes](https://www.ifpsglobal.com/PLU-Codes) to encode and catalogue their produce items. Those are the numbers that you find on stickers on bananas or apples. The [International Federation for Produce Standards](https://www.ifpsglobal.com/) (IFPS) is the global organisation that maintains and assigns those codes in a standardised way.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains the currently defined Price Look Up Codes; about 1,500 distinct numbers at the time this dataset was first published on Kaggle. The data has been derived via the [PLU search](https://www.ifpsglobal.com/PLU-Codes/PLU-codes-Search) on the IFPS website. I will keep the data updated as new codes are added or items are revised.\n\nAlongside the Price Look Up Codes the data contains the produce item's category, measurements, dates of addition to the database, and others. Features are described below. After downloading the data, I'm adding some light wrangling operations to clean column names, remove empty columns, adjust date formats, and to tidy some strings.\n\n\n### Column Description\n\nMost of the feature names are pretty self-explanatory. I've put together this list with the help of the IFPS website. Note, that some columns contain a significant percentage of NA values.\n\n- `plu`: Numeric Price Look Up Code. Primary key.\n\n- `category`: String feature corresponding to a low-cardinaly categorical; e.g. \"fruits\" or \"vegetables\".\n\n- `commodity`: High-cardinality string categorical that is more specific than `category`; e.g. \"apples\" vs \"oranges\" for fruit.\n\n- `variety`: High-cardinality string categorical that is more specific than `commodity`; e.g. \"Alkmene\" vs \"Golden Delicious Blush\" for apples.\n\n- `size`: Which sizes does the product come in? Low-cardinality string categorical; e.g. \"small\" vs \"large\".\n\n- `measurements_north_america`: String. \"The size (count 100 or 88) refers to the number of fruits/vegetables in a standard box most commonly in use in N. America\" (IFPS). Large percentage of NAs.\n\n- `measurements_rest_of_world`: String. \"Average fruit/vegetable weight or diameter is not a minimum weight or diameter, but the average weight or diameter of the items contained in the box irrespective of its size (capacity)\" (IFPS). Large percentage of NAs.\n\n- `restrictions_notes`: String. Mostly specifying restrictions on the geographical usage of the code. Large percentage of NAs.\n\n- `botanical_name`: String. Botanical name.\n\n- `aka`: String. Also known as.\n\n- `notes`: String. A recently added feature of notes which is almost completely empty.\n\n- `revision_date`: Date. When the information in this row was revised.\n\n- `date_added`: Date. When the code was added to the database.\n\n- `gpc`: Integer/Character. Global Product Classification code. Large percentage of NAs.\n\n- `image_url`: Url to an image of the product.\n\n- `image`: The image name extracted from the url. This can soon be used to link to the corresponding image (in a future update of this dataset).\n  \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nAll credit for creating this dataset goes to the [International Federation for Produce Standards](https://www.ifpsglobal.com/).\n\nBanner and vignette photo by [Rithika Gopalakrishnan](https://unsplash.com/@rithika_gopal) on Unsplash.",
