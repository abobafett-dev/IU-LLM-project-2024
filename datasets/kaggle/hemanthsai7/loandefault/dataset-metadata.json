Because of this, every year, banks have losses in crores, and this also impacts the country's economic growth to a large extent. In this hackathon, we look at various attributes such as funded amount, location, loan, balance, etc., to predict whether a person will be a loan defaulter.\n\nTo solve this problem, MachineHack has created a training dataset of 67,463 rows and 35 columns and a testing dataset of 28,913 rows and 34 columns. The hackathon demands a few pre-requisite skills like big datasets, underfitting vs overfitting, and the ability to optimize \u201clog_loss\u201d to generalize well on unseen data.",
