In countries where output power loss due to dust accumulation is considered among the highest rate; monitoring and cleaning solar panels is a crucial task, hence developing an optimal procedure to monitor and clean these panels is very important in order to increase modules efficiency, reduce maintenance cost and reducing the use of resources. \n\nThe objective of this dataset is to investigate the ability of different machine learning classifiers to detect dust on solar panel surfaces with the highest possible accuracy.",
