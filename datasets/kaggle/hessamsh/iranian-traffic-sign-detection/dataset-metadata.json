I set up a dashcam using my phone and a tape and drove for ~ 1 hour. \n\nNext, I got the recorded video and chopped up the frames. I selected only 3-4 frames per second, otherwise I would end up with many frames looking alike. \n\nThe images were not annotated, I needed supervised labels to actually train my network.  I used CVAT for my annotations. It was a time-consuming progress. \n\nThere are multiple signs on the road and many of them are advertisements and not traffic signs. To make sure my model doesn't mix them together, I annotated advertisement signs but put a different label on them. This way my model acknowledged these signs but would differentiate them from the valid traffic signs we wanted to detect. \n\nIf you're looking for a beginner-friendly dataset to practice object recognition give it a look!",
