  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset contains over 22 million English tweets that mention the word \"bitcoin\" and were collected using the snscrape Python package from January 1st, 2021 to June 30th, 2022. The dataset is split into two files, one containing 15.6 million tweets from 2021 and the other containing 7.28 million tweets from the first half of 2022. Each tweet has three columns:\n\n- datetime: The date and time the tweet was posted in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)\n- username: The username of the Twitter account that posted the tweet\n- text: The text content of the tweet\n\nTo make it easier to analyze and work with the dataset, it's recommended to clean and preprocess the data before conducting any analysis. To help with this, a file for cleaning the data is included with the dataset. The cleaning process involves removing duplicates, retweets, non-English tweets, URLs, mentions, hashtags, special characters, and extra whitespace. The resulting cleaned dataset can be used for various purposes, including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and predicting cryptocurrency trends.",
