While numerical data is available, textual features are hard to find. \n\n\nI have compiled a dataset after extracting news headlines from the Inshorts website. Inshorts filters and edits high-quality news articles from various media sources and compiles it on its website and app. I have extracted 2500+ news headlines from its website specifically related to COVID 19 in India starting from 3/3/2020 till 11/4/2020. Features include 'Date' and 'Headline'. \n\nI believe this dataset can be helpful for various kinds of NLP projects related to the impact of Coronavirus in India.\n\n\nFull copyright of the content goes to Inshorts (www.inshorts.com) and other Media Channels.

Also, let me know if you wish to see more features added to this dataset or new kinds of text extraction datasets.",
