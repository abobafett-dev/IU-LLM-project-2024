We apply changes at different magnitudes to evaluate the sensitivity of the proposed anomaly detection system. Thus, we have two states: **normal state** where the arm joints move at default velocity (1.05 rad/s), **anomalous state** where the arm joints move at various velocities. The anomalous state also has two phases: the first phase where the joint velocities are higher than the default, and the second phase where the opposite applies.",
