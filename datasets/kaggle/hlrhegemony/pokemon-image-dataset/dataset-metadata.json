Each folder contains between 1 and 8 images (all .jpg) of the Pokemon, all with white backgrounds and reasonable file size. There are 2,500+ total images, which is much greater than any other Kaggle dataset I have found which preserve background and picture quality (no random backgrounds, nor some white and some black, etc.). Note that all other forms of the Pokemon (gigantamax, mega evolution, Alolan, Galarian, etc.) are included in the same folder.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI hope that a larger, cleaner dataset like this one can result in better GAN's and VAE's.
