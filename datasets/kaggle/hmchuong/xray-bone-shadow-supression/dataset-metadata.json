The model require two types of dataset: normal and bone-suppression X-ray images. The target model can suppress bone shadow from Chest X-ray images, help Radiologists diagnose better lung related diseases. Although there are some softwares supporting bone suppression (ClearRead, CareStream), this project is a practical open source in computer vision and deep learning.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset includes 3 part: Normal Chest X-ray images, Bone Shadow Exclusion Chest X-ray images, and augmented images of the first two parts.",
