Due to existence of noise (stone crack) in inscriptions, this paper uses some image processing techniques to eliminate noises. This system's final output includes: extraction of cuneiform font, Persian and English transcription of sentences, sentence pronunciation and translation of a substantial number of extracted Persian and English words, which makes us better understand the way they spoke in that era. Acquired results of validation and result section indicates that this system has been able to properly cope with the recognition of cuneiform characters and has classified all characters of test data properly with about 92% accuracy.
