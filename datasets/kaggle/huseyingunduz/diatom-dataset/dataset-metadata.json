There are more than 200 genera of diatoms, as well as about 200,000 species. They produce approximately 20-25% of the oxygen on the planet. \n\nAccurate detection, segmentation and classification of diatoms is very important, especially in terms of determining water quality and ecological change.\n\n## Content\nThe dataset contains 2,197 color images with 3,027 diatoms from 68 species.
