The Dataset didn't exist so we decided to create one.\n\n### About Data\n\nWe have collected data from Google Image Search and Images extracted using Youtube Video (Tutorials showing how to wear PPE). It was then labeled for 5 Classes(Mask, Face Sheild, Full Cover, Gloves, Goggles) using LabelImage.\n\nWe have included a sample trained model and TensorFlow record files.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank all these Youtube Videos, Newspaper cuttings with PPE kits, and public images available on Google Search.\n1. https://youtu.be/eCcX1oIIXPE\n2. https://youtu.be/R8lmIdLHEgI\n3. https://youtu.be/FrauHnD9pPU\n4. https://youtu.be/H4jQUBAlBrI\n\n### Inspiration\n\nWe would love to see how the Kaggle community would utilize this dataset! We have trained a model which gives us good results (find it in the model folder)",
