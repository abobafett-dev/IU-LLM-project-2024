Stores share data ranging from 2 to 28 days in a month. While it is possible to impute/extrapolate data for 2 days of a month using 28 days of actual historical data, the vice versa is not recommended.\n\nNielsen encourages you to create a model which can help impute/extrapolate data to fill in the missing data gaps in the store level POS data currently received.\n\n### Content\nYou are provided with the dataset that contains store level data by brands and categories for select stores-\n\n**Hackathon_ Ideal_Data** - The file contains brand level data for 10 stores for the last 3 months.
