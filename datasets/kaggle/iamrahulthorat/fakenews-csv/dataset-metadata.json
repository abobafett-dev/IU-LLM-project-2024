This dataset is useful for training machine learning models to detect fake news.\n\nThis dataset can be used for various applications such as:\n- Training machine learning models to detect fake news in real-time streams of social media posts or news articles.\n- Developing natural language processing (NLP) algorithms that can identify patterns in language use that are indicative of fake news.\n- Creating explainable models that can provide insights into why certain articles are classified as fake news.\n- Evaluating the effectiveness of different feature engineering techniques and machine learning algorithms for detecting fake news.\n- Building applications that can help users make informed decisions about whether to trust a news article or not.",
