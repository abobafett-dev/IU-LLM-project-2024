With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described\u2014of which around 1 million are insects\u2014but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometers (0.00033 in) to 33.6 meters (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs.

The Bilateria include the protostomes\u2014in which many groups of invertebrates are found, such as nematodes, arthropods, and mollusks\u2014and the deuterostomes, containing both the echinoderms as well as the chordates, the latter containing the vertebrates. Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian.
