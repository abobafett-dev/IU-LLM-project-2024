These episodes should typically share the same main characters, some different secondary characters, and a basic theme. Series can have either a finite number of episodes like a miniseries, a definite end or be open-ended, without a predetermined number of episodes. They can be broadcast on television, shown in movie theatres, released direct-to-video, or on the internet. Like other television series, films, including animated films, animated series can be of a wide variety of genres and can also have different demographic target audiences, from males to females ranging from children to adults.\n\n### Content\n\nIn this Dataset, we have Historical data for Animated Television Shows in the world by different parameters like Name of the Show, Number of Seasons, Number of Episodes, Country of Origin, Premiere Year, Final Year, Original Channel, Technique, etc. This Dataset consists of 2 CSV files.
