  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nFast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale, with a strong priority placed on speed of service. It is a commercial term, limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with frozen, preheated, or precooked ingredients and served in packaging for take-out/take-away. Fast food was created as a commercial strategy to accommodate large numbers of busy commuters, travelers, and wage workers. In 2018, the fast food industry was worth an estimated $570 billion globally.\n\nThe fastest form of \"fast food\" consists of pre-cooked meals which reduce waiting periods to mere seconds. Other fast food outlets, primarily hamburger outlets such as McDonald's, use mass-produced, pre-prepared ingredients (bagged buns and condiments, frozen beef patties, vegetables that are pre-washed, pre-sliced, or both; etc.) and cook the meat and french fries fresh, before assembling \"to order\".\n\nFast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by the drive-through. Outlets may be stands or kiosks, which may provide no shelter or seating, or fast food restaurants (also known as quick service restaurants). Franchise operations that are part of restaurant chains have standardized foodstuffs shipped to each restaurant from central locations.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains diverse details regarding the leading 50 fast-food chains in the USA for the year 2021. The primary attributes of this dataset include fast-food chains, U.S. systemwide sales (in millions of U.S. dollars), average sales per unit (in thousands of U.S. dollars), franchised stores, company stores, total units in 2021, and the overall change in units from 2020. It's worth noting that certain values have been estimated by QSR.\n\n### Dataset Glossary (Column-wise)\n\n* <b>Fast-Food Chains</b> - Name of the Fast-Food Chain\n* <b>U.S. Systemwide Sales (Millions - U.S Dollars)</b> - Systemwide Sales in USA (Millions - U.S Dollars)\n* <b>Average Sales per Unit (Thousands - U.S Dollars)</b> - Average Sales per Unit (Thousands - U.S Dollars)\n* <b>Franchised Stores</b> - Number of Franchised Stores\n* <b>Company Stores</b> - Number of Company Stores\n* <b>2021 Total Units</b> - Number of Total Units in 2021\n* <b>Total Change in Units from 2020</b> - Number of Total Changes from Previous Year (2020)\n\n### Structure of the Dataset\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fA7GIyc.png)\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\nThis Dataset is created from <b>[QSR Magazine](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/)</b>.
