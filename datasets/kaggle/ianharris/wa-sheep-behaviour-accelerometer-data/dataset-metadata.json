  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset consists of triaxial acceleration data linked to 143,081 observations.\nAcceleration data and observations were collected from 48 sheep split into 5 flocks. Each flock experienced a different feeding environment.\n\nThe feed and breed details of each flock:\n\nMuresk Dry Pasture: Dry pasture at Muresk Institute, Western Australia (WA) (Hogget Merino ewes)\nMurdoch Green Pasture: Short-green pasture at Murdoch University Farm (Adult Suffolk ewes)\nMuresk Stubble: Stubble at Muresk Institute (Hogget Merino ewes)\nKatanning Green Pasture: Late winter pasture at a farm in Katanning, WA (Adult Merino ewes during lambing)\nMuresk Barley: Grazing cereal crop at Muresk Institute, WA (Adult Merino wethers)\n\nThe data file names and number of sheep of each flock:\n\nMuresk Dry Pasture: 10 sheep, file names: 'Muresk Dry Pasture_X.csv' where X: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\nMurdoch Green Pasture: 10 sheep, file names: 'Murdoch Green Pasture_X.csv' where X: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\nMuresk Stubble: 10 sheep, file names: 'Muresk Stubble_X.csv' where X: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\nKatanning Green Pasture: 9 sheep, file names: 'Katanning Green Pasture_X.csv' where X: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\nMuresk Barley: 9 sheep, file names: 'Muresk Barley_X.csv' where X: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\n\nThe accelerometer data was recorded on Actigrapgh wGT3X-BT acceleration loggers that were sampling at 30Hz with a possible acceleration range of -8 to +8 G. The triaxial acceleration values recorded were in Gs.\nThe Actigrapgh wGT3X-BT has a built-in anti-aliasing filter, so the resulting data does not need to be low pass-filtered to remove sampling artifacts.\n\nThe acceleration data was downloaded from the Actigrapgh devices as a gt3x file and software was developed to convert the gt3x file into a csv file where each row contained acceleration values for the x, y, z axes and a timestamp. As the sampling was at 30Hz, consecutive rows were ~33milli seconds apart.\n\nAll the sheep were videoed and then the videos were viewed and behaviour observations were recorded for 10 second periods. \nSoftware was written that linked the observations to their corresponding 10 seconds of acceleration data. The result is the set of files comprising the dataset. One file of observations and acceleration data for each of the 48 sheep.\n\nColumn Descriptions:\nstudy_name: the name of the flock\nsheep_number: identity of the sheep within a flock\ntime_stamp: the time of the observation and the start of the 10 seconds of acceleration data\nsitting: whether the sheep is sitting or not\nstanding: whether the sheep is standing or not\nwalking: whether the sheep is walking or not\ngrazing: whether the sheep is grazing or not\nruminating: whether the sheep is ruminating or not\nsteps: the number of steps taken by the sheep in the ten second epoch\ntime_stood: the time that the sheep stood up from sitting\ntime_sat: the time that the sheep transition from standing to sitting\nwalk_time: the number of seconds within the 10 second epoch that the sheep was walking.
