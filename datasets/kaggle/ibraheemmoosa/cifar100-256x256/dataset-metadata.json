Doing this upscaling during data loading can cause CPU bottleneck. So here I have preporcessed the images to 256x256 so that you can directly load them.\n\n\n### Content\n\nImages are split into train test following original CIFAR100. Both train and test contain 100 directories. Each of these directories contain images corresponding to that label.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nAll credit goes to the original authors of CIFAR100 dataset. I claim no credit for myself.\n\n",
