Unfortunately, it is surprisingly difficult. The same object will appear to have different colors depending on the lighting conditions. The human eye and brain are good compensate for the lighting conditions automatically, so most people are quite good at this task.

Lego was chosen so that other researchers can recreate the results and extend the dataset if needed. Anyone can order the required lego sets, build the same setup and make additional photos. The Lego setup was photographed in different locations, with different cameras and different lighting conditions.  Given the color values from an image, you determine the color of a lego block. \n\nThe Legocolor dataset was created by Rosalie Fischer for her Bachelor thesis at the Vrije Universiteit. The dataset was designed with the following requirements:\n\n- The dataset must be linked to a classification problem.\n- Unlike existing datasets, the problem should have only a few inputs with identical impact on the final result.\n- The problem should not be a yes/no classification, but a problem with multiple labels.\n- The dataset must be based on a real world problem and use real data.\n- The dataset should not contain personal data, so that it can be used without privacy risks or ethical risks.\n\n\n",
