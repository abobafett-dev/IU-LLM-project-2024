You can use this dataset for the image classification tasks or try to create more interesting things. You can try getting more accurate predictions for the test set.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\nWe will be happy if you upvote this dataset \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\udd3c \u2b06\ufe0f \ud83d\udd3c \u2764\ufe0f \nThanks to [LEGO](https://www.lego.com/en-us) for making wonderful Minifigures ;)\nThe repo with our dataset on github [TinySets Project Page](https://github.com/yisaienkov/tinysets) \n\n### Inspiration\n\nYou can try to resolve the next tasks:\n- Classification images by Minifigures\n- Create GAN for generating new Minifigures",
