As a way to help, I\u2019ve prepared a dataset of beds across countries and states. Work in progress dataset that should and will be updated as more data becomes available and public on weekly basis.\n\n\n### Importance\n\nThis dataset is intended to be used as a baseline for understanding the typical bed capacity and coverage globally.
