The devices measure the RSS of the beacon packets they exchange among themselves in the WSN.\n\nWe collect RSS data using IRIS nodes embedding a Chipcon AT86RF230 radio subsystem that implements the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and programmed with a TinyOS firmware. They are placed on the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chest and ankles. For the purpose of communications, the beacon packets are exchanged by using a simple virtual token protocol that completes its execution in a time slot of 50 milliseconds. A modified version of the Spin token-passing protocol is used to schedule node transmission, in order to prevent packet collisions and maintain high data collection rate. When an anchor is transmitting, all other anchors receive the packet and perform the RSS measurements. The payload of the transmitting packet is the set of RSS values between the transmitting node and the other sensors sampled during the previous cycle.\n\nFrom the raw data we extract time-domain features to compress the time series and slightly remove noise and correlations.\n\nWe choose an epoch time of 250 milliseconds according to the EVAAL technical annex. In such a time slot we elaborate 5 samples of RSS (sampled at 20 Hz) for each of the three couples of WSN nodes (i.e. Chest-Right Ankle, Chest-Left Ankle, Right Ankle-Left Ankle). The features include the mean value and standard deviation for each reciprocal RSS reading from worn WSN sensors.\n\nFor each activity 15 temporal sequences of input RSS data are present. The dataset contains 480 sequences, for a total number of 42240 instances.\n\nWe also consider two kind of bending activity. The positions of sensor nodes with the related identifiers are shown in figure sensorsPlacement.pdf.\n```\n\n\n## Attribute Information:\n\n```\nFor each sequence, data is provided in comma separated value (csv) format.\n\n- Input data:\nInput RSS streams are provided in files named datasetID.csv, where ID is the progressive numeric sequence ID for each repetition of the activity performed.\nIn each file, each row corresponds to a time step measurement (in temporal order) and contains the following information:\navg_rss12, var_rss12, avg_rss13, var_rss13, avg_rss23, var_rss23\nwhere avg and var are the mean and variance values over 250 ms of data, respectively.\n\n- Target data:\nTarget data is provided as the containing folder name.\n\nFor each activity, we have the following parameters:\n# Frequency (Hz): 20\n# Clock (millisecond): 250\n# Total duration (seconds): 120\n```\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nIf you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors\n\n### Citations\n```\nF.
