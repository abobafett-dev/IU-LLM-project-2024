These images were collected in situ from eight rangeland environments across northern Australia.\n\nThe selected weed species are local to pastoral grasslands across the state of Queensland. They include: \"Chinee apple\", \"Snake weed\", \"Lantana\", \"Prickly acacia\", \"Siam weed\", \"Parthenium\", \"Rubber vine\" and \"Parkinsonia\". The images were collected from weed infestations at the following sites across Queensland: \"Black River\", \"Charters Towers\", \"Cluden\", \"Douglas\", \"Hervey Range\", \"Kelso\", \"McKinlay\" and \"Paluma\". The table and figure below break down the dataset by weed, location and geographical distribution.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe labels.csv file assigns species labels to each image. It is a comma separated text file in the format:\n\n```\nFilename,Label,Species\n...\n20170207-154924-0,jpg,7,Snake weed\n20170610-123859-1.jpg,1,Lantana\n20180119-105722-1.jpg,8,Negative\n...\n```\n\nClass and species labels are as follows:\n\n0- Chinee Apple\n1- Lantana\n2- Parkinsonia\n3- Parthenium\n4- Prickly Acacia\n5- Rubber Vine\n6- Siam Weed\n7- Snake Weed\n8- Other.\n\n*Note: The specific label subsets of training (60%), validation (20%) and testing (20%) for the five-fold cross validation used in the paper are also provided here as CSV files in the same format as \"labels.csv\".*\n\nAdditional Information can be found here on [Github](https://github.com/AlexOlsen/DeepWeeds)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nTo cite this, kindly use the following:\n\n```\nIEEE style citation: \"A.
