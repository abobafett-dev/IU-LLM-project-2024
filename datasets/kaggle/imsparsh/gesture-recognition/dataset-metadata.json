These folders are in turn divided into subfolders where each subfolder represents a video of a particular gesture. Each subfolder, i.e. a video, contains 30 frames (or images). Note that all images in a particular video subfolder have the same dimensions but different videos may have different dimensions. Specifically, videos have two types of dimensions - either 360x360 or 120x160 (depending on the webcam used to record the videos).  \n\nEach row of the CSV file represents one video and contains three main pieces of information - the name of the subfolder containing the 30 images of the video sample (gesture), the name of the gesture, and the numeric label (between 0-4) of the video.",
