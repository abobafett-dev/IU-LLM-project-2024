  "descriptionNullable": "An abdominal magnetic resonance imaging scan is an imaging test that uses powerful magnets and radio waves. The waves create pictures of the inside of the belly area. It does not use radiation (x-rays).\n\nSingle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer, viewed on a monitor, printed on film or scanned to a disk. One exam produces dozens or sometimes hundreds of images.\n\n**Alternative Names:** Nuclear magnetic resonance - abdomen; NMR - abdomen; Magnetic resonance imaging - abdomen; MRI of the abdomen\n\n**About Dataset:**\n\nThere are 3 folder for your deep learning project (Train, Test and Valid) that contains an annotation csv file for better understanding and labeling.\nTrain folder contains 1887 images, test 239 images and valid 480 images. Also, you can use valid folder for test part of your modeling, if you think the test part should be larger than valid part.\nSo, Let's do this.\nGood luck\n\nIf you have any question, feel free to ask me in the discussion part.\n\n\nThis dataset was originally created by Xingwei He.",
