  "descriptionNullable": "The age of characters and the actors that portrayed them in the 1st season of 33 teen TV shows released 2000 - 2021\n\n**Data Description:**\n\nThis is a manually collected dataset collected to gain a better understanding of the age differences between teen characters in TV shows and the actors who portray them.\n\n\n**Why does this exist?**\n\nHonestly, I watch a lot of teen TV shows. When I started watching The Politician on Netflix, I realized something interesting. The show stars Ben Platt, an approximately 26 year old actor playing a high school senior. This isn't particularly remarkable since 20-somethings portray teens all the time, but Ben had done something interesting. The characters he portrayed were younger than him, yes, but they were getting younger. In 2012 he played a college freshman in the movie Pitch Perfect, then in 2019 he played a high school senior in The Politician, and in 2021 he played a high school junior in the movie Dear Evan Hansen.\n\nI originally set out to see if any other actors that \"play young\" were Benjamin-Button-ing their way through roles, but ended up focusing solely on TV shows so that I wasn't buried in data collection forever. If you'd like to help me expand this dataset, let me know in the Discussion tab of this dataset!\nMethods\n\nAs mentioned above, this dataset was manually collected. The data includes TV shows that meet the following criteria:\n\nThe show's first season was released between 2000 and 2021 in the US\nThe show primarily takes place either in a high school or centrally focuses teen characters\n\n**Sources**\n\nFor each show, I recorded data for the main characters and supporting characters using the following sources:\n\nActor birthdays were collected on each respective actor's imdb page. Any missing data indicates that the actor had no birthday listed.\n\nCharacter year & Character age were collected primarily through the Fandom website for each TV show. \n\nCharacter gender was collected in the same way as character year & character age. In cases where the character explicitly specified their gender in the show, the explicit statement is what was recorded. In some cases, the character gender and actor gender may not be the same, so this data refers only to character gender.\n\n**Calculations**\n\nDetermining approximate character age when only school year is known used the following assumptions: * college freshman = 18 years old * hs senior = 17 * hs junior = 16 * hs sophomore = 15 * hs freshman = 14 * 5th Year = 17 * 7th grade = 12 * 6th grade = 11\n\n**Dataset updated**\nJan 5, 2024\n\n**Authors**\nAmber Thomas \n\n",
