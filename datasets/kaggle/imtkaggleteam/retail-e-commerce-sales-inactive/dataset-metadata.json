This table contains data described by the following dimensions (Not all combinations are available): Geography (1 item: Canada); Sales (3 items: Retail trade; Electronic shopping and mail-order houses; Retail E-commerce sales).\n\nOf course there is a **MetaData** that describes lots of information about the main dataset values.\nThis dataset helps you to find out how a retail e-commerce can work.\nSo go for it and create some interesting notebook about it.\nFeel free to ask me anything about this dataset on discussion section.\nGood luck",
