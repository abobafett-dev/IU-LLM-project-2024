The columns are as follows:\n\nYear:  Year corresponding to production\nFactory_Name: Name of the Plant where the production was carried out. Note that the name of the company and location are included (in parentheses)\nProduct: produced dairy\nUnity: Kg or Lts\nMonth: Month corresponding to production\nQuantity: Amount produced. Several plants do not make specific products, so they will always have zero product production.\n",
