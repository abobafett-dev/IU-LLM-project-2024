In spite of this, The UCI Machine Learning Repository, known for its extensive collection of datasets beneficial for machine learning and data mining research, has curated and made accessible a unique dataset. This dataset comprises actual transactional data spanning from the year 2010 to 2011. For those interested, the dataset is maintained and readily available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository's site under the title \"Online Retail\".\n\nContent\n\nThe dataset is a transnational one, capturing every transaction made from December 1, 2010, through December 9, 2011, by a UK-based non-store online retail company. As an online retail entity, the company doesn't have a physical store presence, and its operations and sales are conducted purely online. The company's primary product offering includes unique gifts for all occasions. While the company serves a diverse range of customers, a significant number of its clientele includes wholesalers.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nIn collaboration with the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the dataset was provided and made available by Dr. Daqing Chen.
