  "descriptionNullable": "We collected over 10,087 posts from cancer patients and their caregivers on platforms like Reddit, Daily Strength, and the Health Board. The posts were related to five types of cancer: brain, colon, liver, leukemia, and lung cancer. Two team members scored each post based on the emotions expressed, using a scale from -2 to 1. Negative scores (-1 or -2) were given for posts showing grief or suffering, positive scores (1) for happy emotions like relief or accomplishment, and posts with no emotion received a score of 0 and were considered neutral. This analysis aims to understand the emotional aspects of cancer patients posts for a mental health study.\n\n",
