The images were stored using the properties from their original posts, namely, resolution and size varies between images. Four labels have been attached to each image: place, date, level, and scene. \u2019Level\u2019 provides a manually assigned level indicating the amount of sargazo found in that image. The levels were stored using Spanish words and following an incremental order: L = {nada (nothing), bajo (low), moderado (mild), abundante (plenty), and excesivo (excessive)}. We used Spanish words to facilitate the work of the human\nlabelers. With respect to level labels, the dataset is imbalanced given that more examples from \u2018nothing\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 levels were gathered.\"\n\n\nMore information can be found in our research paper:\n\nVasquez, J.
