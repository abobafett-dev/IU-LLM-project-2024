Data extracted from sensors(Voltage sensor, Current sensor) was sent to Firebase with respect to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for pattern identification. The power stored in the battery could charge a phone for 10 minutes.\n\n#**About Dataset**\n\n1. The dataset was manually created over a period of 3 weeks with prototype and product testing. The dataset was made in college with the help of different students from various branches.\n\n2. It contains 3 numerical features voltage (V), current (mA), and weight (kgs). 1 categorical feature that is the step location of the person on the square tile - center, edge, or corner.\n\n3. It also contains null values so be sure to find and drop them with your data analysis skills. Null values occurred due to loose connection of sensors or internal tile connection.",
