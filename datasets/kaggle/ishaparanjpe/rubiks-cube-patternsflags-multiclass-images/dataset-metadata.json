  "descriptionNullable": "The multiclass dataset consists of images of Rubik's cubes with country flags patterned on their faces. Each image represents a unique flag, with the dataset including flags from 5 different countries namely India, Argentina, Russia, France and Italy.\nI created this dataset by forming various patterns representing flags of the 5 countries on my 3x3 Rubik's cube to practice a multiclass image classification problem for a ML project I was working on.\n\nThe images are stored in a standard format, such as JPEG or PNG, and have a consistent resolution to ensure uniformity across the dataset. The dataset is also pre-processed to remove any irrelevant information and artifacts that might hinder the model's performance.\n\nThe dataset is suitable for supervised learning, where a model is trained on a subset of the data to learn the relationship between the image features and the corresponding class labels. The model can then be tested on the remaining data to evaluate its accuracy and generalization capabilities.\n\nOverall, this dataset provides an exciting and challenging task for machine learning models to classify images of Rubik's cubes with country flag patterns accurately.",
