We were exploring deep learning models to perform text summarization for the Bangla language. As there weren't large datasets available on the internet, we decided to mine [Prothom Alo](https://www.prothomalo.com/) website and store their news article data. This dataset is the unaltered version of that mined data. It contains nearly 1 million news articles.\n\n\n### Content\n\nWe mined this huge dataset using the Python Requests library and performed data handling using Pandas. The tool we developed for mining can be found here. The tool saves data in CSV format. Articles published in the same month and year are stored together. We mined news articles all the way back from 2009 to the beginning of 2021. There are 19 columns in total, which are mentioned here:\n* **Time related**: updated_at, last_published_at, content_updated_at, created_at, content_created_at, published_at.\n* **Text related**: body, headline, subheadline, summary\n* **Category related**: tags\n* **Metadata**: id, read_time, word_count, URL, status, content_type, author_name\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nAccumulation of this dataset wouldn't be possible without my teammates [Ahmed Sadman Muhib](https://github.com/ahmedsadman) and [AKM Nahid Hasan](https://github.com/shishir9159). I am also thankful to my thesis supervisor [Dr. Abu Raihan Mostofa Kamal](https://cse.iutoic-dhaka.edu/profile/raihan-kamal/educations) for his guidance, support, and advice.",
