Data derived from censuses are generally reported by National Statistical Offices to the Statistics Division. Census data are also obtained from official census publications produced by National Statistical Offices. Estimates based on data compiled from civil registration systems are generally obtained from National Statistical Offices. Additional sources of data include the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat), the Human Fertility Database (HFD), the Human Fertility Collection (HFC), the Pan-Arab Project for Child Development Surveys (PAPCHILD), the Pan-Arab Project for Family Health Survey (PAPFAM), national surveys, as well as fertility estimates produced by the Population Division of DESA.\n\nThis revision of the database was prepared by Lina Bassarsky and Kyaw Kyaw Lay, under the supervision of Victor Gaigbe-Togbe. Assistance on programming was provided by Kyaw Kyaw Lay. Giulia Gonnella assisted the team with reviewing metadata. This database builds upon a previous edition, World Fertility Data 2017, to which the following contributed: Kirill Andreev, Helena Cruz Castanheira, and Stephen Kisambira. The Population Division extends thanks to our colleagues in National Statistical Offices for providing the requested data, reports and answering our numerous questions regarding the data.\n\nNote:  The designations employed in this publication and the material presented in it do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the Secretariat of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.
