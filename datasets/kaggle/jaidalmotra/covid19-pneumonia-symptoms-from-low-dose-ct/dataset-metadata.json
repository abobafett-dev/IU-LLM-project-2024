  "descriptionNullable": "\nThis dataset leverages advanced AI (artificial intelligence) technology for the analysis of low-dose HRCT (High-resolution chest radiography) data, aiming to identify symptoms indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia. Introducing a novel model architecture, this approach integrates the segmentation of anatomical structures using DNNs-based (deep learning neural network) methods, relying on a substantial volume of labeled data for effective training.\n\nThe proposed model enhances current techniques employed in the inspection of low-dose HRCT images by incorporating Stacked Autoencoders (SAEs) structures within the segmentation function of the Mask-RCNN for area object detection. This integration enables swift analysis of X-ray images, enabling the early detection of abnormalities in patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus, even preceding the manifestation of clinical symptoms.\n\nBeyond the early detection of abnormalities, the area object detection model uncovers findings not previously observed in recent cases of COVID-19. Notably, this study reveals a consistent presence of bilateral pleural effusion in all COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, additional features are integrated into the model to enhance detection quality and expedite the examination period. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners involved in the development and validation of AI models for the early identification of COVID-19-related symptoms in chest radiography.",
