KHN included beds reported in the categories of intensive care unit, surgical intensive care unit, coronary care unit and burn intensive care unit.\n\nKHN then totaled the ICU beds per county and matched the data with county population figures from the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey. KHN focused on the number of people 60 and older in each county because older people are considered the most likely group to require hospitalization, given their increased frailty and existing health conditions compared with younger people.\nFor each county, KHN calculated the number of people 60 and older for each ICU bed. KHN also calculated the percentage of county population who were 60 or older.\n\nKHN\u2019s ICU bed tally does not include Veterans Affairs hospitals, which are sure to play a role in treating coronavirus victims, because VA hospitals do not file cost reports. The total number of the nation\u2019s ICU beds in the cost reports is less than the number identified by the American Hospital Association\u2019s annual survey of hospital beds, which is the other authoritative resource on hospital characteristics. Experts attributed the discrepancies to different definitions of what qualifies as an ICU bed and other factors, and told KHN both sources were equally credible.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nKaiser Health News\n\nhttps://khn.org/news/as-coronavirus-spreads-widely-millions-of-older-americans-live-in-counties-with-no-icu-beds/\nhttps://khn.org/news/as-coronavirus-spreads-widely-millions-of-older-americans-live-in-counties-with-no-icu-beds/\n\nFred Schulte: fschulte@kff.org, @fredschulte\n\nElizabeth Lucas: elucas@kff.org, @eklucas\n\nJordan Rau: jrau@kff.org, @JordanRau\n\nLiz Szabo: lszabo@kff.org, @LizSzabo\n\nJay Hancock: jhancock@kff.org, @JayHancock1\n\n### Inspiration\n\nYour data will be in front of the world's largest data science community.
