The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended in March 2020 to wear a face-covering to prevent people from inhaling out tiny droplets that may carry the virus. Properly mask wearing means the virus transmission can be lowered.\n\n### Code and Reasearch Paper\n\nIf you use this dataset, can you please cite this study. The GitHub code is also provided.\nResearch Paper: [https://www.jardcs.org/abstract.php?id=5699](https://www.jardcs.org/abstract.php?id=5699)\nPython Code: [https://github.com/jamesnogra/ImproperMaskDetector](https://github.com/jamesnogra/ImproperMaskDetector)\n\n### About the Data\n\nThe data consists of four folders, fully_covered, not_covered, not_face, and partially_covered. The folder fully_covered contains faces of people that are wearing face mask properly/correctly according to WHO standards. Folder partially_covered contains face images that the face mask only covers the mouth but not the nose openings. The folder not_covered are face images of people not wearing face mask at all. The not_face folder, which can be optional in training your data, are images that are detected in OpenCV face detection library that are obviously not faces of people.\n\n### Contact\n\nIf you want the full paper, just email me at jamesnogra@gmail.com or you can visit the information website for this study at https://james.iamcebu.com/#face-mask-detection.",
