Sport activities have been recorded by an individual active (non-competitive) athlete. Data is pre-processed, standardized and splitted in four parts (each dimension in its own file):\n* HR-DATA_std_1140x69 (heart rate signals)\n* SPD-DATA_std_1140x69 (speed signals)\n* ALT-DATA_std_1140x69 (altitude signals)\n* META-DATA_1140x4 (labels and details)\n\n**NOTE: Signal order between the separate files must not be confused when processing the data. Signal order is critical; first index in each of the file comes from the same activity which label corresponds to first index in the target data file, and so on. So, data should be constructed and files combined into the same table while reading the files, ideally using nested data structure.

So, each figure contains signal from five different random activities (can be same or different category).
