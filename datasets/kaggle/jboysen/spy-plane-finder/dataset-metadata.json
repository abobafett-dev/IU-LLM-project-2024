You can read the story [here](https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/hidden-spy-planes), and additional analysis and code by [Peter Aldhous](https://github.com/paldhous) can be found [here](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2017-08-spy-plane-finder).\n\n### Content: \nBuzzFeed News obtained more than four months of aircraft transponder detections from the plane tracking website [Flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com), covering August 17 to December 31, 2015 [UTC](http://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html), containing all data displayed on the site within a bounding box encompassing the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\n\nFlightradar24 receives data from its network of ground-based receivers, supplemented by a feed from ground radars provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with a five-minute delay.\n\nAfter parsing from the raw files supplied by Flightradar24, the data included the following fields, for each transponder detection:\n\n- `adshex` Unique identifier for each aircraft, corresponding to its \"[Mode-S](http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Mode_S)\" code, in hexademical format.\n- `flight_id` Unique identifier for each \"flight segment,\" in hexadecimal format. A flight segment is a continuous series of transponder detections for one aircraft. There may be more than one segment per flight, if a plane disappears from Flightradar24's coverage for a period --- for example when flying over rural areas with sparse receiver coverage. While being tracked by Fightradar24, planes were typically detected several times per minute.\n- `latitude`, `longitude` Geographic location in digital degrees.\n- `altitude` Altitude in feet.\n- `speed` Ground speed in knots.\n- `squawk` Four-digit code transmitted by the transponder.\n- `type` Aircraft manufacter and model, if identified.\n- `timestamp` Full UTC timestamp.\n- `track` Compass bearing in degrees, with 0 corresponding to north.\n\nWe also calculated:\n\n- `steer` Change in compass bearing from the previous transponder detection for that aircraft; negative values indicate a turn to the left, positive values a turn to the right.\n\n## Feature engineering\n\nFirst we filtered the data to remove planes registered abroad, based on their `adshex` code, common commercial airliners, based on their `type`, and aircraft with fewer than 500 transponder detections.\n\nThen we took a random sample of 500 aircraft and calculated the following for each one:\n\n- `duration` of each flight segment recorded by Flightradar24, in minutes.\n- `boxes` Area of a rectangular bounding box drawn around each flight segment, in square kilometers.\n\nFinally, we calculated the following variables for each of the aircraft in the larger filtered dataset:\n\n- `duration1`,`duration2`,`duration3`,`duration4`,`duration5` Proportion of flight segment durations for each plane falling into each of five quantiles calculated from `duration` for the sample of 500 planes. The proportions for each aircraft must add up to 1; if the durations of flight segments for a plane closely matched those for a typical plane from the sample, these numbers would all approximate to 0.2; a plane that mostly flew very long flights would have large decimal fraction for `duration5`.\n- `boxes1`,`boxes2`,`boxes3`,`boxes4`,`boxes5` Proportion of bounding box areas for each plane falling into each of five quantiles calculated from `boxes` for the sample of 500 planes.\n- `speed1`,`speed2`,`speed3`,`speed4`,`speed5` Proportion of `speed` values recorded for the aircraft falling into each of five quantiles recorded for `speed` for the sample of 500 planes.\n- `altitude1`,`altitude2`,`altitude3`,`altitude4`,`altitude5` Proportion of `altitude` values recorded for the aircraft falling into each of five quantiles recorded for `altitude` for the sample of 500 planes.\n- `steer1`,`steer2`,`steer3`,`steer4`,`steer5`,`steer6`,`steer7`,`steer8` Proportion of `steer` values for each aircraft falling into bins set manually, after observing the distribution for the sample of 500 planes, using the breaks: -180, -25, -10, -1, 0, 1, 22, 45, 180.\n- `flights` Total number of flight segments for each plane.\n- `squawk_1` Squawk code used most commonly by the aircraft.\n- `observations` Total number of transponder detections for each plane.\n- `type` Aircraft manufacter and model, if identified, else `unknown`.\n\nThe resulting data for 19,799 aircraft are in the file `planes_features.csv`.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements: \nThis dataset was created by [Peter Aldhous](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2017-08-spy-plane-finder) from raw [Flightradar24](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2017-08-spy-plane-finder) data, as well as [FAA](http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/) data.\n\n### Inspiration: \n* Peter used a Random Forest classifier--would another approach be better?
