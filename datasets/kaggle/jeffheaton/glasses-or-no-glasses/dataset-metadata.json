For this competition, students were to determine if a person is wearing glasses or not.  However, your test subjects are not real people.  A Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN) created all of the people that you see in this competition.  The GAN network creates these images using a 512 number latent vector.  The Kaggle assignment provides both the latent vectors and the faces produced by those vectors.
