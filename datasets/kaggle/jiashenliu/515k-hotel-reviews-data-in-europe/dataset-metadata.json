Please be noted that data is originally owned by [Booking.com][2]. \n### Data Context\n\nThis dataset contains 515,000 customer reviews and scoring of 1493 luxury hotels across Europe. Meanwhile, the geographical location of hotels are also provided for further analysis.\n\n### Data Content\n\nThe csv file contains 17 fields. The description of each field is as below:\n\n - Hotel_Address: Address of hotel. \n - Review_Date: Date when reviewer posted the corresponding review.\n - Average_Score: Average Score of the hotel, calculated based on the latest comment in the last year.\n - Hotel_Name: Name of Hotel\n - Reviewer_Nationality: Nationality of Reviewer\n - Negative_Review: Negative Review the reviewer gave to the hotel. If the reviewer does not give the negative review, then it should be: 'No Negative'\n - Review_Total_Negative_Word_Counts: Total number of words in the negative review.\n - Positive_Review: Positive Review the reviewer gave to the hotel. If the reviewer does not give the negative review, then it should be: 'No Positive'\n - Review_Total_Positive_Word_Counts: Total number of words in the positive review.\n - Reviewer_Score: Score the reviewer has given to the hotel, based on his/her experience\n - Total_Number_of_Reviews_Reviewer_Has_Given: Number of Reviews the reviewers has given in the past.\n - Total_Number_of_Reviews: Total number of valid reviews the hotel has.\n - Tags: Tags reviewer gave the hotel.\n - days_since_review: Duration between the review date and scrape date.\n - Additional_Number_of_Scoring: There are also some guests who just made a scoring on the service rather than a review. This number indicates how many valid scores without review in there.\n - lat: Latitude of the hotel\n - lng: longtitude of the hotel\n\n*In order to keep the text data clean, I removed unicode and punctuation in the text data and transform text into lower case. No other preprocessing was performed.*\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThe dataset is large and informative, I believe you can have a lot of fun with it! Let me put some ideas below to futher inspire kagglers!\n\n - Fit a regression model on reviews and score to see which words are more indicative to a higher/lower score\n - Perform a sentiment analysis on the reviews\n - Find correlation between reviewer's nationality and scores.\n - Beautiful and informative visualization on the dataset.\n - Clustering hotels based on reviews\n - Simple recommendation engine to the guest who is fond of a special characteristic of hotel.\n\nThe idea is unlimited! Please, have a look into data, generate some ideas and leave a master kernel here! I am ready to upvote your ideas and kernels! Cheers!\n\n \n\n\n  [1]: http://www.booking.com\n  [2]: http://www.booking.com\n  [3]: https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu",
