Each property has a unique property ID and is associated with a location ID based on the subcategory of the city. The dataset includes the following attributes:\n\nProperty ID: Unique identifier for each property.\nLocation ID: Unique identifier for each location within a city.\nPage URL: The URL of the webpage where the property was published.\nProperty Type: Categorization of the property into six types: House, FarmHouse, Upper Portion, Lower Portion, Flat, or Room.\nPrice: The price of the property, which is the dependent feature in this dataset.\nCity: The city where the property is located. The dataset includes five cities: Lahore, Karachi, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, and Islamabad.\nProvince: The state or province where the city is located.\nLocation: Different types of locations within each city.\nLatitude and Longitude: Geographic coordinates of the cities.\nSteps Involved in the Analysis:\n\n**Statistical Analysis:**\n\nData Types: Determine the data types of the attributes.\nLevel of Measurement: Identify the level of measurement for each attribute.\nSummary Statistics: Calculate mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for numerical attributes.\nData Cleaning:\n\nFilling Null Values: Handle missing values in the dataset.\nDuplicate Values: Remove duplicate records, if any.\nCorrecting Data Types: Ensure the correct data types for each attribute.\nOutliers Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the data.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n\n**Visualization:** Use libraries such as Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly to visualize the data and gain insights.\n**Model Building:**\n\nLibraries: Utilize libraries like Sklearn and pickle.\nList of Models: Build models using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), XG Boost, Gradient Boost, and Ada Boost.\nModel Saving: Save the selected model into a pickle file for future use.\nI hope this captures the essence of the provided information.
