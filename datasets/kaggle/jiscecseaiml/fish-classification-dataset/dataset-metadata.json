  "descriptionNullable": "# ****Labeo Rohita (Rohu) Fish Classification****\n\n##**Introduction:**\nThe Rohu fish, scientifically known as Labeo rohita, is one of the most economically important freshwater fish species in India, particularly in the state of West Bengal. With its significant cultural, nutritional, and economic value, understanding the Rohu fish is crucial for various stakeholders, including fishermen, policymakers, and consumers. This Kaggle writeup provides an in-depth analysis of the Rohu fish, highlighting its scientific characteristics, importance in India, and its specific significance in West Bengal.\n\n##**Scientific Overview:**\nThe Rohu fish, belonging to the family Cyprinidae, is native to rivers and lakes across South Asia, including India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan. It is characterized by its silver-colored body with a slightly arched head and upturned mouth. Rohu is a freshwater species, thriving in rivers, reservoirs, and ponds with moderate water flow and abundant vegetation.\n\n##**Importance in India:**\n1. **Cultural Significance:** Rohu holds cultural significance in Indian cuisine and traditions, being a popular choice for various culinary preparations, especially during festivals and celebrations.\n2. **Nutritional Value:** Rich in protein, vitamins, and essential minerals, Rohu fish is a staple source of nutrition for millions of people across India, contributing to food security and addressing malnutrition concerns.\n3. **Economic Contribution:** The commercial cultivation and trade of Rohu fish contribute significantly to the Indian economy, providing livelihoods for millions of fishermen, aqua culturists, and associated industries.\n\n##**Significance in West Bengal:**\n1. **Cuisine:** In West Bengal, Rohu fish plays a central role in the traditional Bengali cuisine, featuring prominently in dishes such as \"Rohu Machher Jhol\" (Rohu fish curry) and \"Rohu Bhapa\" (steamed Rohu fish).\n2. **Economic Activity:** The cultivation and sale of Rohu fish are integral to the economy of West Bengal, with numerous fish farms and fisheries operating across the state, particularly in districts like Hooghly, Nadia, and North 24 Parganas.\n3. **Cultural Heritage:** Rohu fish is deeply embedded in the cultural heritage of West Bengal, with fishing practices and fish-based dishes reflecting the region's rich culinary traditions and social customs.\n\n##**Datasets Description :**\nThe dataset is essentially a time series dataset. The dataset is created in total 7 days to capture high resolution pictures of fresh and non-fresh eyes and gills. We have used one iPhone 12 to capture the images. Following are the description of the dataset : \n\n1. **Training Dataset:** Fresh Eyes : 223, Fresh Gills : 613, Non-Fresh Eyes : 1028, Non-Fresh Gills : 1265, Total : 3129, Total Size : 10.08 GB, Resolution : 3024x4032 , Image Type : JPG\n2. **Test Dataset:** Fresh Eyes : 134, Fresh Gills : 80, Non-Fresh Eyes : 257, Non-Fresh Gills : 316, Total : 787, Total Size : 2.49 GB, Resolution : 3024x4032 , Image Type : JPG\n3. **Total Dataset:** 3916 , **Total Size:** 12.57 GB\n4. **Dataset Distribution:** We have distributed the whole data into 80% as Training data and 20% as test data. \n\n##**Feature Set :**\nThe gills and eyes of fish are important indicators of freshness, as they provide visual and sensory cues that can help in determining whether a fish is fresh or not.\n\n**Gills:** Fresh fish have bright red or pink gills, indicating good blood circulation and oxygen exchange. As fish age, the gills start to darken and may turn brown or gray due to a decrease in blood flow and oxygen uptake. Additionally, fresh fish gills should be free of any slime or mucus buildup, which can indicate bacterial growth and spoilage.\n\n**Eyes:** The eyes of a fresh fish should be clear, bulging, and bright. Cloudy or sunken eyes can be signs of deterioration. Cloudiness in the eyes could indicate dehydration or decay, while sunken eyes suggest dehydration and dehydration may be caused by prolonged storage or improper handling. Also, the eyes should be glossy and not dried out or cloudy.\n\n##Classification Algorithms: \nFew ML/DL algorithms are mentioned below which can be used for classification for the dataset \n\n###Machine Learning:\n\n- Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n- Random Forests\n- Decision Trees\n- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n- Naive Bayes\n- Logistic Regression\n- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)\n- AdaBoost\n\n###Deep Learning:\n\n- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\n- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\n- Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)\n\n##**Conclusion:**\nThe Rohu fish, with its scientific significance, cultural importance, and economic relevance, holds a special place in India, particularly in West Bengal. As a vital source of nutrition, livelihood, and cultural heritage, understanding and conserving the Rohu fish species are essential for sustainable fisheries management and the well-being of communities reliant on its resources.\n\nBy shedding light on the scientific characteristics and socio-economic significance of the Rohu fish, this Kaggle writeup aims to foster a deeper appreciation for this iconic species and promote informed decision-making in fisheries management and conservation efforts.\n\n##**Acknowledgements for Dataset:**\n\nDr. Partha Sarkar, Principal, JIS College of Engineering, Kalyani, West Bengal, India\n\n##Team: \n\nMr. Chirag Nahata, Student/ML Enthusiast, JIS College of Engineering, Kalyani, West Bengal, India\n\nDr. Sitanath Biswas, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, JIS College of Engineering, Kalyani, West Bengal, India\n\nMr. Subhadip Saha, Student, JIS College of Engineering, Kalyani, West Bengal, India\n\nMr. Subinoy Biswas, Student, JIS College of Engineering, Kalyani, West Bengal, India\n\nMrs. Shubhashree Sahoo, Department of Information Technology, JIS College of Engineering, Kalyani, West Bengal, India\n\nSujata Dash, Professor at Information Technology Department, Nagaland University, Dimapur\n\nMs. Snigdha Ghosh, Student/ML Enthusiast, JIS College of Engineering, Kalyani, West Bengal, India",
