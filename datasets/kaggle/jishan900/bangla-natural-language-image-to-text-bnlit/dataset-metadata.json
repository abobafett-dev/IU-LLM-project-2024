This dataset achieved by a large number of images with classification and containing natural language process of images. We conducted experiments on our self-made Bangla Natural Language Image to Text (BNLIT) dataset. Our dataset contained 8,743 images. We made this dataset using Bangladesh perspective images. We used one annotation for each image. In our repository, we added two types of pre-processed data which is 224 \u00d7 224 and 500 \u00d7 375 respectively alongside annotations of full dataset. We also added CNN features file of whole dataset in our repository which is features.pkl.",
