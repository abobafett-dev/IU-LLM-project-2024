I thought looking at the results and conditions of horse races could provide some interesting angles for practicing data visualization and predicting race outcomes.\n\n### Content\n\nThese data contain information about each horse that competed in any of the three Triple Crown races (Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and Belmont Stakes) between 2005 and 2019.  In total, there are data on 627 horses competing in these events.\n\nThe Race file was entirely scraped from the historical race records on a betting website. It contains information on each horse's name, their jockey, trainer, betting odds at the start of the race,  and their payouts for winning, placing, and showing. A 'win' bet refers to the payout of a bettor chose that horse to win the race, a 'place' bet refers to the payout if a bettor chose that horse to come in either first or second place, and a 'show' bet refers to the payout if a bettor chose that a horse would place in the top three.\n\nI thought it would also be interesting to have some information about the track on the day of a given event, so I also created a file that contains infromation on track conditions. This required doing a lot of secondary research to pull together the relevant information, because many of the indicators I was interested in weren't easily available in a single place.  For example, sometimes I had to read into old news stories just to get data on attendance figures.  The Track Conditions file contains information about the weather on the day of the event (min and max temperature, precipitation, and a qualitative judgement of conditions that typically is made for horse races). It also contains information on the track conditions (e.g. fast, sloppy, muddy) and the attendance of the event.\n\n### Some Research Ideas\n\nOne interesting angle I thought of when compiling this dataset was to see if poorer track conditions increase the probability of a horse with low odds of winning (i.e. high betting odds), since these may even the playing field a bit.
