Political events, market expectations and economic factors are just a few known factors that can impact financial market behaviour. The financial market is a complex, noisy, evolutionary and chaotic field of study that attracts many enthusiasts and researches \u2014 the first, usually driven by the economic benefit of it, the latter, inspired by the challenge of handling such complex data.\n\nThis project aims to predict Facebook (FB) next day stock price direction with machine learning algorithms. Technical indicators and global market indexes are used, and their influence on the forecast accuracy is analysed. \n\n### Content\nDaily values were retrieved (volume, open, close, low and high prices) from Yahoo! Finance website. For Facebook (FB), July 2012 was the earliest data available. The date range is July 2012 to November 2018.\n\nThe closing price of current day C(t) and closing price from the previous day C(t-1) are compared to build the initial dataset. The objective is to define if the price trend is going up or down by analysing these two values. For each instance, a comparison was made and recorded. If the price is going up, C(t) &gt; C(t-1), class \u201c1\u201d is assigned. Class \u201c0\u201d is assigned for the opposite case. \n\n* ID:\tSample ID\n* Close:\tClosing value of previous day\n* Low:\tLowest value of previous day\n* High:\tHighest value of previous day\n* Volume:\tVolume value of previous day\n\nResearch was initiated to understand which features could help the model to forecast the stock direction. Three main routes were found: *Lag* features, Technical Indicators and Global Market Indexes. Below is an explanation of each group of features.\n\n*Lag* features are features that contain the closing price and direction of previous days and it is a common strategy for Time Series models. The following features were added:\n\n* C(t-5):\tClosing price of 5 days before\n* C(t-4):\tClosing price of 4 days before\n* C(t-3):\tClosing price of 3 days before\n* C(t-2):\tClosing price of 2 days before\n* C_up_4:\tOutput 1 if closing price went up 4 days ago\n* C_up_3:\tOutput 1 if closing price went up 3 days ago\n* C_up_2:\tOutput 1 if closing price went up 2 days ago\n* C_up_1:\tOutput 1 if closing price went up 1 day ago\n\nTechnical indicators are used by researches and financial market analysts to support stock market trend forecasting. Common indicators retrieved from the literature were selected and calculated for Facebook stock. Techical  Indicators added:\n\n* MA-10: Moving Average considering previous 10 days\n* MA-5:\tMoving Average considering previous 5 days\n* WMA-10:\tWeighted Moving Average considering previous 10 days\n* SO:\tStochastic Oscillator\n* M:\tMomentum as the difference in closing price in a 10 days interval\n* SSO:\tSlow Stochastic Oscillator\n* EMA: \tExponential Moving Average for a 10 day period\n* MACD_Sline_9:\tMACD Signal Line for a 9 day period\n* RSI:\tRelative Strength Index\n* CCI:\tCommodity Channel Index\n* ADO:\tAccumulation Distribution Oscillator\n\nTechnical indicators provide a suggestion of the stock price movement. Additional features were created for each technical indicator by analysing its daily value and assigning a class according to their meaning. Class \u201c1\u201d is given if the indicator numerical value suggests upper trend, class \u201c0\u201d for a downtrend. In other words, financial market analysis is performed at a **simplistic level**, in the attempt to translate what the continuous value means.\n\n* MA-10&gt;C:\tIf MA-10 is higher than Closing price output 1\n* MA-5&gt;C:\tIf MA-5 is higher than Closing price output 1\n* WMA-10&gt;C:\tIf WMA-10 is higher than Closing price output 1\n* SO&gt;SOt-1:\tOutput is 1 if SO current value is higher than previous day\n* M&gt;0:\tA positive momentum outputs 1\n* SSO&gt;SSOt-1:\tSSO current value is higher than previous day\n* EMA&gt;C:\tIf EMA is higher than Closing price output 1\n* MACD&gt;MACDt-1:\tIf MACD current value is higher than previous day output 1\n* RSI70-30:\tIf RSI is above 70, output 0. Values below 30 output is one. For values within this range it compares to previous day and outputs 1 if value has increased\n* CCI200-200:\tSimilar to RSI, but if threshold set for 200 and -200.\n* ADO&gt;ADOt-1:\tOutput is 1 if ADO current value is higher than previous day\n\nFor a given country or region, the stock market index characterises the performance of its financial market and the overall local economy.  For this reason, the same day performance of these markets could contribute to the machine learning model predictions. Six global indexes were added as features, with their closing direction as up or down, class \u201c1\u201d or \u201c0\u201d, respectively. Data for these indexes (Nikkei, Hang Seng, All Ordinaries, Euronext 100, SSE and DAX) were also retrieved from Yahoo! Finance. \n",
