Histological images for MSI vs. MSS classification in gastrointestinal cancer, FFPE samples [Data set]. Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2530835\n\nMuch of the information in the description come either from the dataset description or the [scientific article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0462-y) using it to predict MSI:\n\nMicrosatellite instability determines whether patients with gastrointestinal cancer respond exceptionally well to immunotherapy. However, in clinical practice, not every patient is tested for MSI, because this requires additional genetic or immunohistochemical tests.\n\n### Content\n\nThis repository contains 192312 unique image patches derived from histological images of colorectal cancer and gastric cancer patients in the TCGA cohort (original whole slide SVS images are freely available at https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). All images in this repository are derived from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) diagnostic slides (\"DX\" at the GDC data portal). This is explained well in this blog: http://www.andrewjanowczyk.com/download-tcga-digital-pathology-images-ffpe/\n\n**Preprocessing**\nAll SVS slides were preprocessed as follows\n\n1. Automatic detection of tumor\n\n2. Resizing to 224 px x 224 px at a resolution of 0.5 \u00b5m/px\n\n3. Color normalization with the Macenko method (Macenko et al., 2009, http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~mn/sites/default/files/macenko2009.pdf)\n\n4. Assignment of patients to either \"MSS\" (microsatellite stable) or \"MSIMUT\" (microsatellite instable or highly mutated)\n\n*5. Reformat the original images to JPG format (using bash command mogrify)*\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to Jakob Nikolas Kather for the paper and the [github page](https://github.com/jnkather/MSIfromHE)\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThis dataset tries to analyze a feature that is actually impossible to identify using the human eye. Additional test are needed to identify this set of patients which take time for the patients to start a treatment. Great sensitivity of this kind of task could lead to a great boost in patient diagnosis and treatment.",
