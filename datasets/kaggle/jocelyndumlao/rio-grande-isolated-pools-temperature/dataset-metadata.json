We collected temperatures of isolated pools (by date and time) that formed during streamflow intermittency in the Middle Rio Grande of New Mexico, USA, 2011-2016 (time.temp2.cs) during fish rescue. We compared these temperatures to stream temperature at an upstream perennial site in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA, by date and time (alameda_combined_final.csv). We also collected Rio Grande silvery minnow during streamflow intermittency in 2018 and 2020 to evaluate post-rescue survival in captivity in 2018 and 2020 (rescue_surv_all.csv).\n\n# Dataset Attribute:\n\n- **collno:** Field collection identification number\n- **rm:**river mile pool was located in\n- **reach:** Reach of river, below Isleta or below San Acacia Diversion Dam\n- **Date:** Date of observation\n- **time :** 24-hour time of observation\n- **time.dec:** Time in hours and decimal hours\n- **depth:** max depth of pool in meters\n- **temperature:** Temperature of pool\n- **use:** flag indicating complete record\n- **time.round:** time rounded down\n- **week:** Week of the year of observation\n- **week.down:** Week of the year rounded down\n- **total.minnows:** total Rio Grande silvery minnows collected from the pool\n- **ph:** pH if observed\n- **do.percent:** dissolved oxygen in percent if observed\n- **do:** do in mg/L if observed\n- **Num:** Entry number\n- **Stamp:** Time and date stamp\n- **doy:** ordinal day of year of observation\n- **temp:**\tWater temperature in Celsius\n- **time:** 24-hour time\n- **time.conv:** conversion column\n- **time.dec:** Time in hours and decimal hours\n- **day:** The day number corresponding to the data entry.\n- **alive:** The number of organisms alive in the aquarium.\n- **start:** The initial count of organisms in the aquarium.\n- **percent:** The percentage of surviving organisms (alive/start).\n- **Year:** year of observation\n- **WJR11-1052:** A code or identifier for a specific category.\n- **TJA11-071:** Another code or identifier for a different category.\n- **B1:** Identifier for a specific group or tank (could indicate different tanks or groups).\n\n# Categories:\n\nFish, Survival Analysis, Water Temperature\n\n# Area covered:\nRio Grande, United States\n\n# Acknowledgment & Data source:\n\nThomas Archdeacon\n\n[Data source](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bz3dvhf95s/1)\n\n[View details](https://plu.mx/plum/a?mendeley_data_id=bz3dvhf95s&theme=plum-bigben-theme)",
