  "descriptionNullable": "This file is based on the new high-resolution Berkeley Earth global temperature data set.  It expands upon the previous Berkeley Earth temperature data set by including predictive structures based on historical weather patterns and increasing the underlying resolution to 0.25\u00c2\u00b0 x 0.25\u00c2\u00b0 latitude-longitude.\n\nFiles based on this new data set are being provided as part of an early preview to aid in the identification of any remaining bugs or errors.  While, we believe the current data set to be accurate and useful, it is still in development and substantial revisions remain possible if significant issues are identified.\n\nThis file contains a detailed summary of the changes in Earth's global average surface temperature estimated by combining the new high-resolution Berkeley Earth land-surface temperature field with a reinterpolated version of the HadSST4 ocean temperature field.  \n\nAs a preliminary data product, no citation for this work currently exists.\n \nThis global data product merges land-surface air temperatures with ocean sea surface water temperatures.  For most of the ocean, sea surface temperatures are similar to near-surface air temperatures; however, air temperatures above sea ice can differ substantially from the water below the sea ice.  In sea ice regions, temperature anomalies are extrapolated from the land-surface air temperatures when ice is present, and from the ocean temperatures when ice is absent.\n\nThe percent coverage of sea ice was taken from the HadISST v2 dataset and varies by month and location.
