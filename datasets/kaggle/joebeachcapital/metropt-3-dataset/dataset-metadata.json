H1 (bar) \u2013 the measure of the pressure generated due to pressure drop when the discharge of the cyclonic separator filter occurs.\n4. DV pressure (bar) \u2013 the measure of the pressure drop generated when the towers discharge air dryers; a zero reading indicates that the compressor is operating under load.\n5. Reservoirs (bar) \u2013 the measure of the downstream pressure of the reservoirs, which should be close to the pneumatic panel pressure (TP3).\n6. Motor Current (A) \u2013  the measure of the current of one phase of the three-phase motor; it presents values close to 0A - when it turns off, 4A - when working offloaded, 7A - when working under load, and 9A - when it starts working.\n7. Oil Temperature (\u00baC) \u2013  the measure of the oil temperature on the compressor.\n8. COMP - the electrical signal of the air intake valve on the compressor; it is active when there is no air intake, indicating that the compressor is either turned off or operating in an offloaded state.\n9. DV electric \u2013 the electrical signal that controls the compressor outlet valve; it is active when the compressor is functioning under load and inactive when the compressor is either off or operating in an offloaded state.\n10. TOWERS \u2013 the electrical signal that defines the tower responsible for drying the air and the tower responsible for draining the humidity removed from the air; when not active, it indicates that tower one is functioning; when active, it indicates that tower two is in operation.\n11. MPG \u2013 the electrical signal responsible for starting the compressor under load by activating the intake valve when the pressure in the air production unit (APU) falls below 8.2 bar; it activates the COMP sensor, which assumes the same behaviour as the MPG sensor.\n12. LPS \u2013 the electrical signal that detects and activates when the pressure drops below 7 bars.\n13. Pressure Switch - the electrical signal that detects the discharge in the air-drying towers.\n14. Oil Level \u2013 the electrical signal that detects the oil level on the compressor; it is active when the oil is below the expected values.\n15. Caudal Impulse \u2013 the electrical signal that counts the pulse outputs generated by the absolute amount of air flowing from the APU to the reservoirs.\n\n**Introductory Paper**\n\n[Predictive maintenance based on anomaly detection using deep learning for air production unit in the railway industry](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9564181)\n\nBy Davari, N., Veloso, B., Ribeiro, R.P., Pereira, P.M., Gama. 2021\n\nPublished in 2021 IEEE 8th International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)",
