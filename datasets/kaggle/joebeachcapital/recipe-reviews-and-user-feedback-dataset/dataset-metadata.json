It includes essential information such as the recipe name, its ranking on the top 100 recipes list, a unique recipe code, and user details like user ID, user name, and an internal user reputation score. Each review comment is uniquely identified with a comment ID and comes with additional attributes, including the creation timestamp, reply count, and the number of up-votes and down-votes received. Users' sentiment towards recipes is quantified on a 1 to 5 star rating scale, with a score of 0 denoting an absence of rating. This dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists, facilitating endeavors in sentiment analysis, user behavior analysis, recipe recommendation systems, and more.
