It is then possible for the Moon's penumbral, umbral or antumbral shadows to sweep across Earth's surface thereby producing an eclipse. There are four types of solar eclipses:\n\n    Partial - Moon's penumbral shadow traverses Earth (umbral and antumbral shadows completely miss Earth)\n    Annular - Moon's antumbral shadow traverses Earth (Moon is too far from Earth to completely cover the Sun)\n    Total - Moon's umbral shadow traverses Earth (Moon is close enough to Earth to completely cover the Sun)\n    Hybrid - Moon's umbral and antumbral shadows traverse Earth (eclipse appears annular and total along different sections of its path). Hybrid eclipses are also known as annular-total eclipses. [2]\n\nTotal eclipses are visible from within the Moon\u2019s umbral shadow while annular eclipses are seen within the antumbral shadow . These eclipses can be classified as central [3] or non-central as:\n\n    Central (two limits) - The central axis of the Moon\u2019s shadow cone traverses Earth thereby producing a central line in the eclipse track. The umbra or antumbra falls entirely upon Earth so the ground track has both a northern and southern limit.\n    Central (one limit) - The central axis of the Moon\u2019s shadow cone traverses Earth. However, a portion of the umbra or antumbra misses Earth throughout the eclipse and the resulting ground track has just one limit.\n    Non-Central (one limit) - The central axis of the Moon\u2019s shadow cone misses Earth. However, one edge of the umbra or antumbra grazes Earth thereby producing a ground track with one limit and no central line.\n\nThe recurrence of solar eclipses is governed by the Saros cycle. For more information, see Periodicity of Solar Eclipses.\nCatalog of Solar Eclipses\n\nThe catalog lists concise details and local circumstances at greatest eclipse[4] for every solar eclipse during the century.\n\n**Key to Catalog of Solar Eclipses**\nColumn \tHeading \tDefinition/Description\n1 \tCatalog Number \tSequential number of the eclipse in the catalog links to the map published in the Five Millennium Canon of Solar Eclipses: -1999 to +3000.\n2 \tCalendar Date \tCalendar Date at instant of Greatest Eclipse. Gregorian Calendar is used for dates after 1582 Oct 15.

The Moon's coordinates are based on the ELP-2000/82 theory [Chapront-Touze and Chapront, 1983]. For more information, see: Solar and Lunar Ephemerides. The revised value used for the Moon's secular acceleration is n-dot = -25.858 arc-sec/cy*cy, as deduced from the Apollo lunar laser ranging experiment (Chapront, Chapront-Touze, and Francou, 2002).\nThe largest uncertainty in the eclipse predictions is caused by fluctuations in Earth's rotation due primarily to tidal friction of the oceans due to the Moon. The resultant drift in apparent clock time is expressed as delta-T and was was determined as follows:\n\n    pre-1950's: delta T was calculated from empirical fits to historical records derived by Morrison and Stephenson (2004)\n    1955-present: delta T was obtained from published observations\n    future: delta-T was extrapolated from current values weighted by the long term trend from tidal effects\n\n**References for Solar Eclipse Predictions**\n\nBretagnon P., Francou G., \"Planetary Theories in rectangular and spherical variables: VSOP87 solution\", Astron.
