While I do not in anyway endorse the specific methodology used to construct these rankings, I know that many academic institutions and scholars use these rankings in their research and institutional assessment. I was in turn frustrated that historical rankings were not easily available anywhere online. The spreadsheets above contain all of the rankings from 1985-present for liberal arts colleges and from 1984-present for universities.\n\nThe data for liberal arts colleges were compiled from the actual articles releasing the data each year (any errors in entry are my own). I have included tiers for many years for the liberal arts college rankings, but most were only available online and not in print editions. The second tab lists the information that is still missing. If anyone has any of that information please contact me, I would like to fill in all of the gaps.\n\nThe data for universities is incomplete, with some years containing only the top 50 universities and others 150. They were compiled with the help of Akil Bello and Arjun Khandelwal from existing online sources. The second tab of each spreadsheet includes specific notes on the rankings for each year and sources. If anyone has any of the missing data, please contact me, I would like to fill in all of the gaps. Thanks to Melissa Whately for help with the IPEDS numbers.\n\nAndrew G.
