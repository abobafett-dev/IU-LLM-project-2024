We are compiling this time series data from state and local governments and health departments in an attempt to provide a complete record of the ongoing outbreak.\n\nSince late January, The Times has tracked cases of coronavirus in real-time as they were identified after testing. Because of the widespread shortage of testing, however, the data is necessarily limited in the picture it presents of the outbreak.\n\nWe have used this data to power our [maps](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) and [reporting](https://www.nytimes.com/coronavirus) tracking the outbreak, and it is now being made available to the public in response to requests from researchers, scientists, and government officials who would like access to the data to better understand the outbreak.\n\nThe data begins with the first reported coronavirus case in Washington State on Jan. 21, 2020. We will publish regular updates to the data in this repository. \n\n## United States Data\n\nData on cumulative coronavirus cases and deaths can be found in two files for states and counties.\n\nEach row of data reports cumulative counts based on our best reporting up to the moment we publish an update. We do our best to revise earlier entries in the data when we receive new information.\n\nBoth files contain [FIPS codes](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/note/US/fips), a standard geographic identifier, to make it easier for an analyst to combine this data with other data sets like a map file or population data.\n\nDownload all the data or clone this repository by clicking the green \"Clone or download\" button above.\n\n### State-Level Data\n\nState-level data can be found in the [states.csv](us-states.csv) file. ([Raw CSV file here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv))\n\n```\ndate,state,fips,cases,deaths\n2020-01-21,Washington,53,1,0\n...\n```\n\n### County-Level Data\n\nCounty-level data can be found in the [counties.csv](us-counties.csv) file. ([Raw CSV file here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv))\n\n```\ndate,county,state,fips,cases,deaths\n2020-01-21,Snohomish,Washington,53061,1,0\n...\n```\n\nIn some cases, the geographies where cases are reported do not map to standard county boundaries. See the list of [geographic exceptions](#geographic-exceptions) for more detail on these.\n\n## Methodology and Definitions\n\nThe data is the product of dozens of journalists working across several time zones to monitor news conferences, analyze data releases and seek clarification from public officials on how they categorize cases. \n\nIt is also a response to a fragmented American public health system in which overwhelmed public servants at the state, county and territorial levels have sometimes struggled to report information accurately, consistently and speedily. On several occasions, officials have corrected information hours or days after first reporting it. At times, cases have disappeared from a local government database, or officials have moved a patient first identified in one state or county to another, often with no explanation. In those instances, which have become more common as the number of cases has grown, our team has made every effort to update the data to reflect the most current, accurate information while ensuring that every known case is counted.\n\nWhen the information is available, we count patients where they are being treated, not necessarily where they live.\n\nIn most instances, the process of recording cases has been straightforward. But because of the patchwork of reporting methods for this data across more than 50 state and territorial governments and hundreds of local health departments, our journalists sometimes had to make difficult interpretations about how to count and record cases.\n\nFor those reasons, our data will in some cases not exactly match the information reported by states and counties. Those differences include these cases: When the federal government arranged flights to the United States for Americans exposed to the coronavirus in China and Japan, our team recorded those cases in the states where the patients subsequently were treated, even though local health departments generally did not. When a resident of Florida died in Los Angeles, we recorded her death as having occurred in California rather than Florida, though officials in Florida counted her case in their records. And when officials in some states reported new cases without immediately identifying where the patients were being treated, we attempted to add information about their locations later, once it became available.\n\n* Confirmed Cases\n\nConfirmed cases are patients who test positive for the coronavirus. We consider a case confirmed when it is reported by a federal, state, territorial or local government agency.\n\n* Dates\n\nFor each date, we show the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths as reported that day in that county or state. All cases and deaths are counted on the date they are first announced.\n\n* Counties\n\nIn some instances, we report data from multiple counties or other non-county geographies as a single county. For instance, we report a single value for New York City, comprising the cases for New York, Kings, Queens, Bronx and Richmond Counties. In these instances, the FIPS code field will be empty. (We may assign FIPS codes to these geographies in the future.) See the list of [geographic exceptions](#geographic-exceptions). \n\nCities like St. Louis and Baltimore that are administered separately from an adjacent county of the same name are counted separately.\n\n* \u201cUnknown\u201d Counties\n\nMany state health departments choose to report cases separately when the patient\u2019s county of residence is unknown or pending determination. In these instances, we record the county name as \u201cUnknown.\u201d As more information about these cases becomes available, the cumulative number of cases in \u201cUnknown\u201d counties may fluctuate.\n\nSometimes, cases are first reported in one county and then moved to another county. As a result, the cumulative number of cases may change for a given county.\n\n### Geographic Exceptions\n\n* New York City\n\nAll cases for the five boroughs of New York City (New York, Kings, Queens, Bronx and Richmond counties) are assigned to a single area called New York City.\n\n* Kansas City, Mo.\n\nFour counties (Cass, Clay, Jackson, and Platte) overlap the municipality of Kansas City, Mo. The cases and deaths that we show for these four counties are only for the portions exclusive of Kansas City. Cases and deaths for Kansas City are reported as their line.\n\n* Alameda, Calif.\n\nCounts for Alameda County include cases and deaths from Berkeley and the Grand Princess cruise ship.\n\n* Chicago\n\nAll cases and deaths for Chicago are reported as part of Cook County. \n\n\n## License and Attribution\n\nIn general, we are making this data publicly available for broad, noncommercial public use including by medical and public health researchers, policymakers, analysts and local news media.\n\nIf you use this data, you must attribute it to \u201cThe New York Times\u201d in any publication.

We do our best to revise earlier entries in the data when we receive new information.\n\nBoth files contain [FIPS codes](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/note/US/fips), a standard geographic identifier, to make it easier for an analyst to combine this data with other data sets like a map file or population data.\n\nDownload all the data or clone this repository by clicking the green \"Clone or download\" button above.\n\n### State-Level Data\n\nState-level data can be found in the [states.csv](us-states.csv) file. ([Raw CSV file here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv))\n\n```\ndate,state,fips,cases,deaths\n2020-01-21,Washington,53,1,0\n...\n```\n\n### County-Level Data\n\nCounty-level data can be found in the [counties.csv](us-counties.csv) file. ([Raw CSV file here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv))\n\n```\ndate,county,state,fips,cases,deaths\n2020-01-21,Snohomish,Washington,53061,1,0\n...\n```\n\nIn some cases, the geographies where cases are reported do not map to standard county boundaries. See the list of [geographic exceptions](#geographic-exceptions) for more detail on these.\n\n## Methodology and Definitions\n\nThe data is the product of dozens of journalists working across several time zones to monitor news conferences, analyze data releases and seek clarification from public officials on how they categorize cases. \n\nIt is also a response to a fragmented American public health system in which overwhelmed public servants at the state, county and territorial level have sometimes struggled to report information accurately, consistently and speedily. On several occasions, officials have corrected information hours or days after first reporting it. At times, cases have disappeared from a local government database, or officials have moved a patient first identified in one state or county to another, often with no explanation. In those instances, which have become more common as the number of cases has grown, our team has made every effort to update the data to reflect the most current, accurate information while ensuring that every known case is counted.\n\nWhen the information is available, we count patients where they are being treated, not necessarily where they live.\n\nIn most instances, the process of recording cases has been straightforward. But because of the patchwork of reporting methods for this data across more than 50 state and territorial governments and hundreds of local health departments, our journalists sometimes had to make difficult interpretations about how to count and record cases.\n\nFor those reasons, our data will in some cases not exactly match with the information reported by states and counties. Those differences include these cases: When the federal government arranged flights to the United States for Americans exposed to the coronavirus in China and Japan, our team recorded those cases in the states where the patients subsequently were treated, even though local health departments generally did not. When a resident of Florida died in Los Angeles, we recorded her death as having occurred in California rather than Florida, though officials in Florida counted her case in their own records. And when officials in some states reported new cases without immediately identifying where the patients were being treated, we attempted to add information about their locations later, once it became available.\n\n* Confirmed Cases\n\nConfirmed cases are patients who test positive for the coronavirus. We consider a case confirmed when it is reported by a federal, state, territorial or local government agency.\n\n* Dates\n\nFor each date, we show the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths as reported that day in that county or state. All cases and deaths are counted on the date they are first announced.\n\n* Counties\n\nIn some instances, we report data from multiple counties or other non-county geographies as a single county. For instance, we report a single value for New York City, comprising the cases for New York, Kings, Queens, Bronx and Richmond Counties. In these instances the FIPS code field will be empty. (We may assign FIPS codes to these geographies in the future.) See the list of [geographic exceptions](#geographic-exceptions). \n\nCities like St. Louis and Baltimore that are administered separately from an adjacent county of the same name are counted separately.\n\n* \u201cUnknown\u201d Counties\n\nMany state health departments choose to report cases separately when the patient\u2019s county of residence is unknown or pending determination. In these instances, we record the county name as \u201cUnknown.\u201d As more information about these cases becomes available, the cumulative number of cases in \u201cUnknown\u201d counties may fluctuate.\n\nSometimes, cases are first reported in one county and then moved to another county. As a result, the cumulative number of cases may change for a given county.\n\n### Geographic Exceptions\n\n* New York City\n\nAll cases for the five boroughs of New York City (New York, Kings, Queens, Bronx and Richmond counties) are assigned to a single area called New York City.\n\n* Kansas City, Mo.\n\nFour counties (Cass, Clay, Jackson and Platte) overlap the municipality of Kansas City, Mo. The cases and deaths that we show for these four counties are only for the portions exclusive of Kansas City. Cases and deaths for Kansas City are reported as their own line.\n\n* Alameda, Calif.\n\nCounts for Alameda County include cases and deaths from Berkeley and the Grand Princess cruise ship.\n\n* Chicago\n\nAll cases and deaths for Chicago are reported as part of Cook County. \n\n\n## License and Attribution\n\nIn general, we are making this data publicly available for broad, noncommercial public use including by medical and public health researchers, policymakers, analysts and local news media.\n\nIf you use this data, you must attribute it to \u201cThe New York Times\u201d in any publication.
