  "descriptionNullable": "**Context:**\nNews portals provide content to millions of users in current days, from topics like sports to politics. In this sense, recommender systems have become key applications for news websites to filter relevant articles to users among an ever-growing catalog. \n\nTaking into account the need for proper datasets publicly available for researchers to discuss and explore solutions on common ground, we introduce the News Portal Recommendations (NPR) dataset by the [Globo](http://www.globo.com) media company. The dataset consists of an improved version of a past dataset ([News Portal User Interactions by Globo.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gspmoreira/news-portal-user-interactions-by-globocom)), but also focusing in providing the necessary information for research on normative diversity in news recommender systems. NPR was built by sampling users from the [G1 portal](http://g1.globo.com), the largest Brazilian news portal maintained by Globo.\n\n\n**Content:**\nThe dataset contains 1,162,802 randomly sampled users who received recommendations in the period between January 3rd, 2023 and May 1st, 2023, where nearly 73% are anonymous users. All users were anonymized in order to protect data privacy. It also contains an articles file containing metadata for 148,099 news items that were either consumed or recommended to the users.\n\nBelow we describe its folders and files:\n&gt; * *behaviors*: folder with recommendations impressions and user consumption history.\n&gt; * *articles*: folder with metadata information about published articles. It contains a file with all columns and also a copy of the file but without the *body* column.\n&gt; * *impressions*: folder with files containing recommendations generated by 3 different approaches (ALS, Recents, and Top). Each file refers to recommendations provided by one specific algorithm, but all files share the same users and impression Ids. The folder also contains a reduced version of the behavior and article files, which refer only to users and articles within the impressions files.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\nWe would like to acknowledge Globo for providing this dataset for this research and for the academic community, in special to the Recommendation team for preparing the original dataset from the G1 Portal.",
