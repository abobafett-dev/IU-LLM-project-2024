  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset has three types of variables: 1) inflow variables, 2) outflow variables, and 3) water level variables. Generally, we expect the water level variables to be the cumulative of inflow - outflow. \n\nAnalysis Tasks:\n\n* There appears to be an outlier / glitch in some of the inflow and water level variables on July 1, 2022. The outlier shows a drastic negative inflow which does not make sense. One preliminary task is to replace this outlier in an informed manner with a reasonable value.\n\n* Another task is forecasting Lake Powell's water level. Specifically, I think forecasting the \"storage\" variable make the most sense, as the other water level variables are dependent on the shape of the canyon. \"storage\" is likely the most linearly related to the inflow variables for this reason.\n",
