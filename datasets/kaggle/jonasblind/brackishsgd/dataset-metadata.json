This paper proposes a synthetic framework for generating realistic underwater fish data, using BOIDs and high-definition rendering. The synthetic data is used to train and test an EfficientDet model, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, on the Brackish data set, an underwater fish detection data set captured in the turbid waters of the Limfjord, Denmark. The results demonstrate that there is no significant disparity observed when synthetic data is incorporated with the Brackish method, assumed to be attributed to the limited number of epochs trained.
