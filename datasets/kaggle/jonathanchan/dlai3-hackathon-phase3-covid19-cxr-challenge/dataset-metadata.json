More details about the challenge can be found at [https://www.kaggle.com/c/dlai3-phase3/](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dlai3-phase3/).\n\nMedical image analysis has continually been an area of prominent and growing importance, in both the research and application aspects. However, it is important to realize that the algorithms, methodology, as well as the source of data, need to be strictly scrutinized. Phase 3 of the DLAI3 Hackathon is a challenge that provides a mixed dataset of publicly available COVID-19 chest x-ray images from various sources, a pneumonia dataset obtained from a study on children, partially verified thorax CXR images of adults from NIH, and unverified no-finding images from NIH. See below for the sources of these data.\n\nThe participants are challenged to obtain good performance in their modeling in the Public and Private Leaderboards, \nas well as to be able to interpret their results in form of a full paper submission to CSBio2020 under CHAT-2020 (www.csbio.org/2020/). A test set will be provided after the Phase 3 DLAI3 Hackathon competition.\n\nPlease cite this dataset as follows: Jonathan H.
