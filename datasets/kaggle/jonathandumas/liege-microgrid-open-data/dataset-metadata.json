Centralized controllers are often subdivided in operational planning controllers that optimize decisions over a time horizon of one or several days, and real-time optimization controllers that deal with actions in the current market period. The coordination of these levels is of paramount importance. In this paper we propose a value function based approach as a way to propagate information from operational planning to real-time optimization. We apply this method to an environment where operational planning, using day-ahead forecasts, optimizes at a market period resolution the decisions to minimize the total energy cost and revenues, the peak consumption and injection related costs, and plans for reserve requirements, while real-time optimization copes with the forecast errors and yields implementable actions based on real-time measurements. The approach is compared to a rule-based controller on three use cases, and its sensitivity to forecast error is assessed.*\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset is composed:\n\n- 15 minutes resolution weather forecast (solar irradiation, air temperature, etc) produced by the Laboratory of Climatology of the university of Li\u00e8ge, based on the MAR regional climate model;\n- 5 seconds resolution monitored PV and consumption of the MiRIS microgrid;\n- 15 minutes resolution PV and consumption weather based forecasts produced by our forecaster and used in the study.\n\nThe weather based forecasts are multi outputs with an horizon of 24 hours ahead and a resolution of 15 minutes.
