The datasets have very detailed information on each accident including location, time, weather, contributing factors and demographic information of the motorists involved in the accident. The sampling program was deeply impacted by the COVID19 pandemic, thus there is nothing beyond the year 2020 due to a major overhaul of the program to accommodate remote work. The 2020 data may be very sparse for the months of March through May given the fact that these reports come from local police departments and many of those were impacted in the spring of 2020. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt; Each year has three files, 'acc' = accident information, 'pers' = demographic and other information relating to individuals involved in the accident, 'veh' detailed vehicle information for the vehicles involved in the reported accident.
