At first thought I did some experimentation to photograph bricks from different angles but this was time consuming. That is why I turned to computer rendering of the bricks. I rendered a first version of dataset in 2018 using Blender, but decided to create a new version in 2019 using Autodesk Maya 2020. \n\n\n### Content\nIn the version 2 dataset, you will find 50 different LEGO bricks rendered by 800 different angles. I have documented step by step how the dataset was created in notebook [How to create a LEGO bricks dataset using Maya](https://www.kaggle.com/joosthazelzet/how-to-create-a-lego-bricks-dataset-using-maya). \n\nPlease take notice of the [notebook ](https://www.kaggle.com/joosthazelzet/how-to-create-a-lego-bricks-dataset-using-maya) why I used a 2 camera setup. They way I see it you have 2 options:\n1. Ignore the 2 camera setup and treat all images a one set. This should be fine and easiest way to proceed\n2. Use the extra left/right information to score a little higher.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\nI used the Autodesk Maya 30 days trial version. Mecabricks.com is a free online Lego modeling tool.  And LEGO for creating their ecosystem. \n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI hope you can take advantage of this simple set in your learning or research. Enjoy! ",
