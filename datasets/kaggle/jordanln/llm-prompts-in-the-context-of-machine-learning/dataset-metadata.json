  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset is an extension of my previous work on creating a dataset for natural language processing tasks. It leverages binary representation to characterise various machine learning models. The attributes in the dataset are derived from a dictionary, which was constructed from a corpus of prompts typically provided to a large language model (LLM). These prompts reference specific machine learning algorithms and their implementations.\nFor instance, consider a user asking an LLM or a generative AI to create a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for a particular application. By applying this concept to multiple machine learning models, we constructed our corpus. This corpus was then transformed into the current dataset using a bag-of-words approach. In this dataset, each attribute corresponds to a word from our dictionary, represented as a binary value: 1 indicates the presence of the word in a given prompt, and 0 indicates its absence. At the end of each entry, there is a label.\nEach entry in the dataset pertains to a single class, where each class represents a distinct machine learning model or algorithm. This dataset is intended for multi-class classification tasks, not multi-label classification, as each entry is associated with only one label and does not belong to multiple labels simultaneously.\nThis dataset has been utilised with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the Keras Automodel API, achieving impressive training and testing accuracy rates exceeding 97%. Post-training, the model's predictive performance was rigorously evaluated in a production environment, where it continued to demonstrate exceptional accuracy.\nFor this evaluation, we employed a series of questions, which are listed below. These questions were intentionally designed to be similar to ensure that the model can effectively distinguish between different machine learning models, even when the prompts are closely related.\n\n**KNN**\nHow would you create a KNN model to classify emails as spam or not spam based on their content and metadata?\nHow could you implement a KNN model to classify handwritten digits
