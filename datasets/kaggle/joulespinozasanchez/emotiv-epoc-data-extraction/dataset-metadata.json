I began planning this project towards the end of my penultimate year of studies. I knew that I wanted to develop a Machine Learning project and was exploring various topics in that field. Concurrently, I was involved in research projects with the Professor **Aurora Torres Soto**, who mentioned the possibility of undertaking a project that could be incorporated into my thesis while also assisting her with her research project. Her project involved using an *Emotiv Epoc+* headset to translate brain activity into specific actions. After several project phases, it evolved to translate brain activity into two mental processes: concept evocation and movement intention.\n\nFor this project, I decided that I would need a data collection phase. This is where I recruited volunteers for data collection using the headset. Throughout this entire process, my bachelor's thesis \"**Comparative analysis of algorithms in the classification of movement intention through a brain-computer interface**\" was concluded, which can be accessed at this link [here](https://github.com/Joul24py/UAA-ICI-Thesis).",
