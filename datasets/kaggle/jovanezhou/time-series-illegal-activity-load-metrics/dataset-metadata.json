  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset, named \"Time Series Illegal Activity Load Monitor,\" offers a comprehensive uni-variable time series analysis of server host load percentages recorded at one-minute intervals. It categorizes system load into four distinct labels: normal operation (0), unauthorized video encoding/decoding activities (1), illicit overclocking for enhanced compute power (2), and covert cryptocurrency mining activities (3). This classification aids in identifying and analyzing the impact of various unauthorized actions on server performance, time length is 1024 for each period, serving as a crucial tool for research in cybersecurity and system integrity maintenance.The dataset is meticulously curated from a real-world production environment, ensuring its relevance and applicability in practical scenarios related to cybersecurity and server management. This aspect significantly enhances the dataset's value for empirical research and the development of robust defense mechanisms against unauthorized server load alterations.",
