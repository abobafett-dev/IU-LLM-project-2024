We believe that multiple opinions are better than one, user voices can be as important as critics, and opinions must be scored to be easy to use.\nOur Metascore system is unique and merits its own explanation page.\n\nEach review includes various data points such as the **movie title**, **release year**,  **review text** , **rating** , and **sentiment** . The data can be used for sentiment analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning applications such as text classification, recommendation systems, and more.\n\nSince the dataset includes reviews from two different websites, it offers a diverse range of opinions and perspectives on a wide variety of movies. Additionally, the large size of the dataset makes it a valuable resource for researchers, analysts, and data scientists who are interested in studying movie reviews and developing new insights into audience preferences, trends, and behaviors.\n\nOverall, this dataset offers a rich source of information for anyone who wants to analyze or explore movie reviews in depth.",
