Computationally, it took its time and it's still incomplete - however I thought I'd put this out there as the only leagues with anything missing are Ligue 1 and the RFPL.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nhttps://understat.com/ - great service for all your football (soccor) stat needs.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI really enjoy football and data - mixing the two into one on Kaggle was a fun summer project in Data engineering & Data Science ahead of the new season! On my other dataset - I have a notebook showing a Neural Network being used to track probability of matches being won/drawn/lost by each team in a given game.",
