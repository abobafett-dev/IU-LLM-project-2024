  "descriptionNullable": "# Hacker News Posts with Text Embeddings\n\n*Disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with Y Combinator*\n\n## Description\n\nThis dataset contains more than 100,000 posts from Hacker News, a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. The dataset includes the following fields for each post:\n\n-     `id`: the story id (primary key)\n-     `title`: the story title\n-     `url`: the story url\n-     `score`: the story score\n-     `time`: the timestamp of the story\n-     `comments`: the number of comments\n-     `author`: the author of the story\n-     `embeddings`: an array of 1536 floats representing the story embedding\n\nThe dataset is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and contains only stories that have a score greater than 100. The text of each article was extracted from the link and embeddings were computed using the `text-ada-embeddings-002` model from OpenAI.\n\n## Data Collection\n\nThe data was collected using the Hacker News API. I have written a blog post explaining how I have fetched the articles and computed the embeddings. You can find the post [here](https://julienc.me/articles/Extract_embeddings_Hacker_News_article).\n\n## Data Visualizations\n\nIn this section, I will include some visualizations of the data to help users better understand the dataset. \n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F6427690%2F820162ee825c8741ae320d05cd774807%2Fpie-category.png?generation=1686496783988983&alt=media)\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of the stories in the dataset.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F6427690%2F5aa6f3a6ca5aed5418f278e2dc68f8df%2Fbar-category.png?generation=1686496805580497&alt=media)\n\nFigure 2: Relationship between the number of comments and the score for the stories in the dataset.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F6427690%2F0c16c95f6edc06bf2f04c714ff2ef703%2Fprojection-embeddings.png?generation=1686496851070905&alt=media)\n\nFigure 3: t-SNE projection of the story embeddings.\n\n## Future Updates\n\nI plan to update this dataset regularly to include new stories from Hacker News. I may also add new fields to the dataset based on user feedback and suggestions. If you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to contact me.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis dataset can be used for various natural language processing tasks such as text classification, clustering, and sentiment analysis. The embeddings can also be used for tasks such as similarity search and recommendation systems.\n\n## Citation\nIf you use this dataset in your research, please cite the following:\n\n```bibles\n@misc{julien cagniart_2023,\n\ttitle={Hacker News OpenAI Embeddings},\n\turl={https://www.kaggle.com/dsv/5901263},\n\tDOI={10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/5901263},\n\tpublisher={Kaggle},\n\tauthor={Julien CAGNIART},\n\tyear={2023}\n}\n```\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to Diffbot for providing their APIs for free to extract the text of the articles.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nHere is an example of how to import the `story.csv` file using Pandas and convert the `embeddings` column from JSON to a numpy array:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport json\n\n# Load the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('story.csv')\n\n# Convert the embeddings column from JSON to numpy array\ndf['embeddings'] = df['embeddings'].apply(lambda x: np.array(json.loads(x)))\n```\n\nNow the `embeddings` column contains a numpy array of shape `(1536,)` for each story.",
