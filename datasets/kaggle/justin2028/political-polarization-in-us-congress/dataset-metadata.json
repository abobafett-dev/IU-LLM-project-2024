This procedure was developed by Keith T. Poole and Howard Rosenthal in the 1980s and is a \"scaling procedure\", representing legislators on a spatial map. In this sense, a spatial map is much like a road map--the closeness of two legislators on the map shows how similar their voting records are. Using this measure of distance, DW-NOMINATE is able to recover the \"dimensions\" that **inform congressional voting behavior**.\n\nWhy did I create this dataset? In my personal opinion, **political polarization** is the **greatest threat to democracy** today, particularly in America. Polarization not only creates an \"US VS THEM\" situation, but also renders legislative bodies **less effective** at passing meaningful legislation. By uploading time-series data regarding American polarization over the past two centuries, I hope that the community will use my dataset to determine insightful statistical trends. Achieving a **quantitative yet objective viewpoint** of **political polarization** is crucial to understanding both its underlying causes and its everlasting effects.\n\n###### IMPORTANT:\nThe **first dimension** picks up **differences in ideolology**, which is represented through the **\"liberal\" vs. \"conservative\"** (also referred to as \"left\" vs. \"right\") proportions throughout American history. \nThe **second dimension** picks up **differences within the major political parties** over slavery, currency, nativism, civil rights, and lifestyle issues during periods of American history.\n\n# Data Sources\n##### The primary data source used was Voteview's official website, which publishes ideological data pertaining to America. Considering the meticulous documentation of congressional activities by such an accredited organization, no other organization is more equipped to provide insight on US polarization.\n\n1.
