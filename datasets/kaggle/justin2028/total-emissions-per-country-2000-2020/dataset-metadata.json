What sets this dataset apart from similar ones is the inclusion of emissions **OUTSIDE** of CO2 such as CH4 and N2O.

As global warming becomes worse, countries across the globe will look to **shift the blame** for environmental consequences on one another. By providing a dataset that tracks emission per country, I hope to keep countries **accountable** for their contributions to the crisis.
