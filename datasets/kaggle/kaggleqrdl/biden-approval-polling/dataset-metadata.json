I often used this data to help predict where it will go next.  For example, Rasmussen is a very fresh pollster (daily), while the others are somewhat lagging.   You can even subscribe to Rasmussen's service and get updates before most people, though this particular exploit is well known.\n\n### Content\n\nThe data is fairly straightforward and I include a brief description of each of the columns.   \n\nSomething to be aware: a few pollsters, such as Ipsos, will report wildly different results within days because they are sometimes polling for specific organizations, such as the Economist and sometimes just for themselves.  In these different surveys, there are different questions used, and thus different 'house effects' (ie: political bias).   For example, some surveys start with the question \"Do you approve of the direction of the country?\", while others will start with \"Do you approve of Joe Biden?\"\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI would like to acknowledge Nate Silver and the whole 538 crew for aggregating this data.  Very interesting and informative - https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/  \n\nPlease note I have removed all 538 model specific information such as weights, grades, etc.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI think it'd be very cool to see how far ahead we could predict changes in Biden's approval ratings, possibly using other sources such as twitter and news organizations, plus maybe other datasets on Kaggle itself.",
