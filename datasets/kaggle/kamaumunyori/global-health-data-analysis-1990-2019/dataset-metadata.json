Men are also at a higher risk of death from these diseases compared to women both globally and locally in Kenya. \n\n-The probability of dying between age 30 and 70 from any of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease in Kenya has been observed to be significantly inversely proportional to the prevalence of alcohol, substance use anxiety and eating disorders.\n\n-Suicide rates have been observed to not have a significant direct relationship with any mental health disorders both globally and locally however the most significant correlation is the probability of dying between age 30 and 70 from any of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease in the global analysis.\n\n-Globally a significant inverse relationship between road traffic death rate and eating disorders has been observed however there is a slightly significant relationship between depressive disorders and road traffic death which should be an indicator for further research.\n\n-In Kenya, its been observed that road traffic deaths are inversely proportional to the probability of dying between age 30 and 70 from any of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease but directly proportional to eating, anxiety, alcohol and substance use disorders.\n\n-Depressive disorders is the most significant variable that has an impact on suicide rates in Kenya therefore further study can look into the impact of depression on attempted and reported suicide cases and other factors that may influence suicide as it has been on the rise in Kenya.\n\n-Road traffic accidents have a significant impact of the mental health of several Kenyans.\n\n# Recommendations.\n-There should be more education regarding suicide prevention for NGOs.\n\n-Corporate firms should look into providing observed health insurance and mental health days off in addition to more sick days for the affected.\n\n-The government can implement policies and programs that provide more efficient facilities for the handling of observed health issues.\n\n-Insurance companies can restructure their products around the knowledge that mental health issues in Kenya have a significant direct relationship to each other and also that the prevalence of alcohol and substance use critically impacts the road traffic death rate in Kenya.\n\n-The government should critically look at the increase in the prevalence of alcohol and substance use disorder in Kenya and especially their impact on mental health and road safety.\n\n-Corporate entities can support any employee impacted by road accident death in order to reduce the risk decreased productivity as a result of emergence mental health issues in their employees.\n\n# Further Research.\n-There should be some research conducted looking into why the probability of death between the age of 30 to 70 from from any of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases in Kenya has been on the rise since 2016 while it has been decreasing globally.\n\n-The impact of depression on attempted and reported suicide cases and other factors that may influence suicide as it has been on the rise in Kenya.\n\n-Why men have a higher suicide rate compared to women and factors that led to higher suicide cases in Kenya compared to global cases.",
