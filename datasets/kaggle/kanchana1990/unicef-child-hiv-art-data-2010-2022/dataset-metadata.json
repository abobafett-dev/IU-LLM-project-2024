The data tracks ART coverage percentages annually across various countries and regions, highlighting the progress in healthcare intervention for affected children.\n\n**Columns**:\n- **Country_Region**: The name of the country or region.\n- **Year**: The calendar year for which data is provided.\n- **ART_Coverage**: The estimated percentage of children living with HIV who received ART during the respective year.\n\n**Usage**:\nDesigned for non-commercial applications, this dataset is apt for academic research, public health policy analysis, and machine learning models focused on time series forecasting and global health studies.\nThe original UNICEF dataset has been meticulously processed to facilitate time series analysis. In this refined version, extraneous columns such as 'ISO3', 'Type', 'UNICEF Region', 'Data Source', 'Lower Bound', and 'Upper Bound' have been omitted to focus exclusively on the temporal progression of ART coverage. The remaining columns are 'Country_Region', capturing the geographical identifier; 'Year', denoting the temporal aspect; and 'ART_Coverage', reflecting the percentage of children receiving ART. This distillation enhances clarity and usability for longitudinal analysis.\n\n\n**Dataset Update Notice**:\nWe've enhanced our dataset collection! Alongside our existing `HIV Paediatric ART Coverage (Processed)` dataset, we've now added the `HIV Paediatric ART Coverage (Cleaned)` version. This new dataset offers refined data with clearer distinctions in the `ART_Coverage` column, representing both percentages and actual numbers of children receiving ART. It's tailored for more immediate analysis, saving time on data preprocessing. \n\n**Note**: Detailed information about the dual nature of the `ART_Coverage` column is provided in the dataset description. We encourage users to explore both versions according to their analytical needs.\n\n\n**License**:\nThis content is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 IGO (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO).
