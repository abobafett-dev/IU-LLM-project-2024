For some subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement). A preview image of the Database of Faces is available.\n\nThe files are in PGM format, and can conveniently be viewed on UNIX (TM) systems using the 'xv' program. The size of each image is 92x112 pixels, with 256 grey levels per pixel. The images are organised in 40 directories (one for each subject), which have names of the form sX, where X indicates the subject number (between 1 and 40). In each of these directories, there are ten different images of that subject, which have names of the form Y.pgm, where Y is the image number for that subject (between 1 and 10).\n\nThe database can be retrieved from http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/DTG/attarchive:pub/data/att_faces.tar.Z as a 4.5Mbyte compressed tar file or from http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/DTG/attarchive:pub/data/att_faces.zip as a ZIP file of similar size.\n\nA convenient reference to the work using the database is the paper Parameterisation of a stochastic model for human face identification.
