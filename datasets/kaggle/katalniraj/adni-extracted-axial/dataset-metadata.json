It becomes slightly difficult to work directly on the 3D data, hence the given dataset was created for easy implementation of the image processing algorithms.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset consists of 2D axial images extracted from the ADNI baseline dataset which consisted of Nifti images. It consists of 3 classes, i.e. AD (Alzheimer's Disease), CI (Mild Cognitive Impaired) and CN (Common Normal) subjects\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe images have been extracted from the ADNI Baseline dataset (NIFTI format) which consisted of 199 instances. The original images can be downloaded from https://ida.loni.usc.edu/login.jsp?project=ADNI.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nAlzheimer's is one of the most prevailing neurodegenerative disorder these days. Data availability becomes a hurdle for researchers. Thus this dataset would be of great help for those researchers who are working in the field of AD diagnosis.",
