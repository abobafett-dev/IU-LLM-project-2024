This will hopefully spark more interest in NLFF on South African data.\n\n\n### Content\n\nStock Exchange News Service (SENS) announcements are South African announcements such as mergers, take-overs, rights offers, capital issues, cautionaries of listed companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). This is a mandatory disclosure as it  impacts the price movement in the market. This is similar to the SEC corporate 8K/10KQ filings. This data spans from August 2012 to January 2019. This was attained through web scraping news vendors and a process of wrangling and joining with other financial data vendors to get the additional information about the companies.\n\nBelow are the fields and their descriptions : \n\n1. datetime - Date and Time of the announcements in SAST\n2. SENS_Ticker - Local Ticker\n3. Yahoo_Ticker - Yahoo Ticker for ease of adding additional features\n4. BBG_Ticker - Bloomberg Ticker for ease of adding additional features\n5. ISIN - ISIN code\n6.

A few suggestions would be : \n\n1. Unsupervised Learning on the announcements to provide further insight into Feature Engineering used in Supervised Learning \n2. Label Data incorporating event study methodology\n3. Look to answer questions in the lines of the information impact on price movement and perhaps incorporating your findings in building a Decision Support System for market participants.\n",
