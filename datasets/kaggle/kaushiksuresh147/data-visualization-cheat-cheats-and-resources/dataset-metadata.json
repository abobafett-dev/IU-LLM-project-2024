By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.\n\nIn the world of Big Data, data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyze massive amounts of information and make data-driven decisions\n\n### The Data Visualizaion Copus\n\n### The Data Visualization corpus consists:\n- **32 cheat sheets**: This includes A-Z about the techniques and tricks that can be used for visualization, Python and R visualization cheat sheets, Types of charts, and their significance, Storytelling with data, etc..\n\n- **32 Charts:** The corpus also consists of a significant amount of data visualization charts information along with their python code, d3.js codes, and presentations relation to the respective charts explaining in a clear manner!\n\n- **Some recommended books for data visualization every data scientist's should read:**\n   1. Beautiful Visualization by Julie Steele and Noah Iliinsky\n   2. Information Dashboard Design by Stephen Few  \n   3. Knowledge is beautiful by David McCandless (Short abstract)\n   4.
