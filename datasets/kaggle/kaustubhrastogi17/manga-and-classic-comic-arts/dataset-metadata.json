  "descriptionNullable": "# Comic Art Dataset: Manga vs. Classic\n\n## Description\n\nThe Comic Art Dataset consists of images categorized into two classes: Manga and Classic. These images are collected from various sources (Google, bing, and webscraped) and carefully labeled to distinguish between manga-style artwork and classic-style artwork.\n\n### Classes:\n\n1. **Manga**: This class includes images that represent artwork typical of manga, a style of Japanese comic books and graphic novels.\n   \n2. **Classic**: This class includes images that represent classic-style artwork, which may include Western comic book art or traditional comic illustrations.\n\n### Contents:\n\n**Images Folder**: The dataset is structured with an Images folder, under which there are two subdirectories:\n\n- Manga: This directory contains images representing manga-style artwork.\n- Classic: This directory contains images representing classic-style artwork.\n  \nThe images are organized into subdirectories corresponding to their respective classes.\n\n### Use Case:\n\nThis dataset can be used for various purposes, including but not limited to:\n\n- Training and testing machine learning models to classify comic art into manga or classic categories.\n- Research in computer vision, pattern recognition, and image classification.\n- Educational purposes for teaching image classification techniques and methodologies.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe would like to express our gratitude to the creators and artists whose works are included in this dataset. Without their contributions, this dataset would not have been possible.",
