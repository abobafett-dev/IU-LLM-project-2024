It's like a living, breathing organism. During an analysis you can find out some very interesting insights, some may even shock you! Other times the data shows the exact opposite thing that you might have expected. And sometimes it ... doesn't tell you anything really. But in that \"nothingness\" there is still a great deal to learn.\n\nHence, I would encourage you to start looking at the datasets with fresh eyes - free of any bias, hunch or belief that you might have. Don't try to \"show\" a conclusion that you might already think you have, as this usually limits your creativity.\n\n### Double Check your Accuracy\nAnother very important thing is the accuracy of the visualization. Nothing is worse than creating an amazing, beautiful graph ... that shows innaccurate insights, information and conclusion. Be sure you create a double verification process, when you reiterate what you have already done and check yourself for any mistakes.\n\n### Tools to help you\nLastly, try to have fun! Take inspiration from outside and bring it into your analysis. I like to look at movies, books, paintings, even interior design to inspire myself. Use color, use images, stickers, movement and pattern. I am leaving here some of my favorite sources and tools for inspiration:\n* Canva for schemas, covers, images etc.: https://www.canva.com/\n* Coolors for creating and combining the perfect color palette: https://coolors.co/\n* How to use Markdown: https://spec-md.com/#note-eb0b0\n* Create your own allerts: https://codepen.io/keikaavousi/pen/eYOmOpN\n* Visualization Inspiration from Cedric Scherer: https://www.cedricscherer.com/\n",
