  "descriptionNullable": "This study aimed to identify the most influential age groups in COVID-19 infection rates at the US county level using the Modified Morris Method and deep learning for time series. The approach involved training the state-of-the-art time-series model Temporal Fusion Transformer on different age groups as a static feature and the population vaccination status as the dynamic feature. The impact of those age groups was analyzed on COVID-19 infection rates by perturbing individual input features and ranked them based on their Morris sensitivity scores, which quantify their contribution to COVID-19 transmission rates. The data contains the population by age subgroups for each of the 3,142 US counties, along with the daily vaccination rate of the population and COVID-19 case report from March 1, 2020, to Dec 27, 2021. The eight age subgroups are 0-4, 5-17, 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-64, 65-74, and 75 and older for all counties.\n\n## Features\n\nThe following table lists the features with their source and description.
