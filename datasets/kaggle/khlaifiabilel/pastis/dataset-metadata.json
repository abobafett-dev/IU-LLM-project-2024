It is composed of 2433 one square kilometer-patches in the French metropolitan territory for which sequences of satellite observations are assembled into a four-dimensional spatio-temporal tensor. The dataset contains both semantic and instance annotations, assigning to each pixel a semantic label and an instance id. There is an official 5 fold split provided in the dataset's metadata.",
