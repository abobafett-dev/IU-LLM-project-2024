  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset contains the price history of 22,492 (as of 4th May 2024). The price history can be extracted from the steam api endpoint 'https://steamcommunity.com/market/pricehistory/?appid=730&market_hash_name={}'. This returns the data of the median sale prices graph (e.g/ https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/2020%20RMR%20Contenders the green line graph). The steam community market api provides the last month of sales split into hour windows containing the number of that item sold and the median price it was sold for during that hour. Anything past a month is given in one day windows containing the number of items sold and the median price during that day. To provide the highest possible resolution data every 28 days the api endpoints can be scraped and stitched to the previous months data to gain 2 months of 1-hour accurate data.\n\nAs of 4th May 2024:\nThe dataset contains information on 22,492 items and has recorded 5,764,583,111 transactions worth \u00a35,723,673,120.27 calculated from 99,348,409 data slices.",
