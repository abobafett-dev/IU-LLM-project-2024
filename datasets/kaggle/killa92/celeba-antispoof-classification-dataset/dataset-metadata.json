The dataset has no split of train, validation, and  test folders; so, there is need to split the data for Machine Learning and Deep Learning model training process. The structure of the data is as follows:\n\n- ROOT\n   - class1:\n       - live:\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - ........\n            - img_file.\n       - spoof:\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - ........\n            - img_file.\n\n   - class2:\n       - live:\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - ........\n            - img_file.\n       - spoof:\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - ........\n            - img_file.\n\n...\n\n - classN:\n       - live:\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - ........\n            - img_file.\n       - spoof:\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - ........\n            - img_file.\n\nFor the image classification task, class names can be obtained from the directory names.
