It takes months of meticulous planning and delegation to host these events impeccably.\nOne such firm has decided to take a data-driven approach for planning their gala nights. Aesthetics and entertainment are the most crucial segments of these events. So, this firm has hired you to help them aggregate and classify all images. These images are published by attendees and the paparazzi on various social media channels and other sources. You are required to build an image auto-tagging model to classify these images into separate categories\n\n\n### Content\n\n**Dataset**\nThe dataset consists of 5,983 images that belong to 4 categories. These categories are food, attire, decor and signage, and miscellaneous.\nThe benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning or Deep Learning techniques are as follows:\nThis challenge encourages you to apply your Machine Learning skills to build models that classify images into multiple categories\nThis challenge helps you enhance your knowledge of classification actively. It is one of the basic building blocks of Machine Learning and deep learning techniques.\nYou are required to build a model that auto-tag images and classifies them into various categories of aesthetics and entertainment for a gala night.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset is taken from Hackerearth Deep Learning comptitation.\nRef: [Hackerearth Deep Learning comptitation Link](https://hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-deep-learning-challenge-auto-tag-images-gala/)\nThanks to Hackerearth for nice datasets.\nThanks to kaggle for the platform.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nGetting Started Deep Learning: Start your Deep Learning journey.",
