We are able to follow the expression of this gene in many neurons for several days to understand how the neural network in the suprachiasmatic nucleus synchronizes the circadian clock of individual neurons to produce a precise circadian rhythm. We analyze each image to determine the fluorescence intensity of each neuron over multiple\ncircadian cycles. \n## FAQ\n\n### How where the images obtained: which animal and what staining?\n\nThe images were taken from a transgenic mouse in which expression of the fluorescent protein Venus is driven by the promoter for the circadian clock gene Period 1.\n\n### What is the anatomy of the images, and how are they oriented?\n\nThe bright line is the third ventricle, which resides on the midline of the brain. The two bright regions on either side of the ventricle are the two portions of the Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Below the ventricle and the SCN is a dark horizontal band that represents the optic chasm. \n\n### What is the bright vertical line in the top middle?\n\nThe bright line is the third ventricle. Pericytes that line the ventricle express the Venus at very high levels. We don't know the function of the circadian clock in these cells.  \n\n## Challenge\n\nCurrently we have to analyze each experiment by hand to follow an individual through a couple hundred images. This takes several days. This problem is going to get worse because we have just purchased a new automated microscope stage that will allow us to simultaneously image\nfrom four suprachiasmatic nuclei. \n\n# Preview\n\n<div style=\"position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:75.0%\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2kx1LM_AU-0?ecver=2\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n[![Video of Measurements](https://img.youtube.com/vi/2kx1LM_AU-0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kx1LM_AU-0)\n\n# Ideas for Analysis\n- Wavelets (pywavelets) following https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18931366 \n\n# Questions\n\n - Do the cells move during the experiment? \n - How regular is their signal?\n - Is the period 24 hours?\n - Do nearby cells oscillate together?\n - Do they form chunks or groups, over what range do they work?\n - Are there networks formed from time-precedence?",
