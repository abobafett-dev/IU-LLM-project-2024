In particular, the data has 8 different classes of tissue (but Cancer/Not Cancer can also be an interesting problem).\n\n## Challenge\n- Classify tiles correctly into one of the eight classes\n- Which classes are most frequently confused? \n- What features can be used (like texture, see scikit-image) to improve classification?\n- How can these models be applied to the much larger 5000x5000 models? How can this be done efficiently?\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\nThe dataset has been copied from Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/record/53169#.W6HwwP4zbOQ with [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.53169.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.53169)\n\n made by: Kather, Jakob Nikolas; Z\u00f6llner, Frank Gerrit; Bianconi, Francesco; Melchers, Susanne M; Schad, Lothar R; Gaiser, Timo; Marx, Alexander; Weis, Cleo-Aron\n\nThe copy here is to make it more accessible to Kaggle users and allow kernels providing basic analysis of the data\n\n## Content\n\nThis data set represents a collection of textures in histological images of human colorectal cancer. It contains two files:\n\n\"Kather_texture_2016_image_tiles_5000.zip\": a zipped folder containing 5000 histological images of 150 * 150 px each (74 * 74 \u00b5m). Each image belongs to exactly one of eight tissue categories (specified by the folder name). \n\"Kather_texture_2016_larger_images_10.zip\": a zipped folder containing 10 larger histological images of 5000 x 5000 px each. These images contain more than one tissue type. \nImage format\n\nAll images are RGB, 0.495 \u00b5m per pixel, digitized with an Aperio ScanScope (Aperio/Leica biosystems), magnification 20x. Histological samples are fully anonymized images of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human colorectal adenocarcinomas (primary tumors) from our pathology archive (Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany).\n\n## Ethics statement\n\nAll experiments were approved by the institutional ethics board (medical ethics board II, University Medical Center Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Germany; approval 2015-868R-MA).
