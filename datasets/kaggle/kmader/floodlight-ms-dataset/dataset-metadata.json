The tasks are categorized into the following:\n- **Brain**: Quick daily questions about how participants feel to understand their well-being and mood. Matching symbol tasks to assess the speed of processing information.\n- **Hand**: Hand-motor function tasks designed by healthcare professionals to gather information on manual dexterity, strength, and precision over time.\n- **Mobility**: Walking and posture tasks to track changes in your mobility, stability, speed, and balance over time.\n- **Passive monitoring**: Collect data continuously in the background on how participants move throughout the day. \n\n### Related Publications\n- [FLOODLIGHT Open \u2013 A Global, Prospective, Open-Access Study to Better Understand Multiple Sclerosis Using Smartphone Technology](https://cmsc.confex.com/cmsc/2019/mediafile/Handout/Paper5900/QOL10_CMSC%202019%20FLOODLIGHT%20Open%20Poster_Global_van%20Beek%20et%20alFINA.pdf ) \n- [Digital Health: Smartphone-based monitoring of multiple sclerosis using Floodlight](https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-019-00412-0) \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe data came from the Floodlight Open Study: https://floodlightopen.com, please reference and cite the original page and check there for more details on the acquisition, protocol, ethics approval, and updated data.\n\n### Inspiration\n\n- Can you come up with a classifier for accurately differentiating the MS from the control patients? \n- How does the time change for activity performance vary between MS and healthy patients?\n- Can you predict the severity (speed and amount of deterioration) of MS from information about the patient (age, initial abilities, location)",
