In these countries projects there are in many cases available X-ray machines (through low-cost projects and donations), but often the radiological expertise is missing for accurately assessing the images. An algorithm that could perform this task quickly and cheaply could drastically improve the ability to diagnose and ultimately treat the disease.\n\nIn more developed countries, X-ray radiography is often used for screening new arrivals and determining eligibility for a work-permit. The task of manually examining images is time consuming and an algorithm could increase efficiency, improve performance and ultimately reduce cost of this screening. \n\nThis dataset contains over 500 x-rays scans with clinical labels collected by radiologists.\n\n# Acknowledgements\nThe two datasets were published together in an analysis here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4256233/.\nThe datasets come from Shenzhen and Montgomery respectively.\n\n### China Set - The Shenzhen set - Chest X-ray Database\n\nThe standard digital image database for Tuberculosis is created by the National Library of Medicine, Maryland, USA in collaboration with Shenzhen No.3 People\u2019s Hospital, Guangdong Medical College, Shenzhen, China. The Chest X-rays are from out-patient clinics, and were captured as part of the daily routine using Philips DR Digital Diagnose systems. \nNumber of X-rays: \n\n* 336 cases with manifestation of tuberculosis, and \n* 326 normal cases.\n\nIt is requested that publications resulting from the use of this data attribute the source (National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA and Shenzhen No.3 People\u2019s Hospital, Guangdong Medical College, Shenzhen, China) and cite the following publications:  \n\n* Jaeger S, Karargyris A, Candemir S, Folio L, Siegelman J, Callaghan F, Xue Z, Palaniappan K, Singh RK, Antani S, Thoma G, Wang YX, Lu PX, McDonald CJ.
