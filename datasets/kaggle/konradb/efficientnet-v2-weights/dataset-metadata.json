Built upon EfficientNetV1, our EfficientNetV2 models use neural architecture search (NAS) to jointly optimize model size and training speed, and are scaled up in a way for faster training and inference speed. \n\nThe original github repo: https://github.com/google/automl/tree/master/efficientnetv2",
