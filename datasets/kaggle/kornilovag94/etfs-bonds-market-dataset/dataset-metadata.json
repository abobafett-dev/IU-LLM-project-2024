I provide prices, volumes, and connected options' data. In my opinion, it's the best ETFs datasets on Kaggle you can find. \n\nThe data is presented in CSV format as follows: \n1. Date.\n2. Close Price.\n3. Open Price.\n4. Low Price.\n5. High Price. \n6. Volume - Total number of shares traded on security on the date.\n7. Average Bid Ask Spread % - Average of all bid/ask spreads taken as a percentage of the mid price.\n8. Total Put Volume - The total amount of put option contracts (all strike prices and all expiration dates) traded during the previous trading day. If there were no trades the previous day,  this field will return the latest volume available, if any, from the most recent 10 trading days.\n9. Total Call Volume - The total amount of call option contracts (all strike prices and all expiration dates) traded during the previous trading day. If there were no trades the previous day,  this field will return the latest volume available, if any, from the most recent 10 trading days.\n10.

For historical values, the dates represent the end date of the period the data is for, not the date when the data was made publicly available. For example, if the data is for the two-week period ending on October 15 and that data is made publicly available on October 25, the date shown is October 15.\nFor options' columns and bid-ask spread the data available from 2012 year.\n\n",
