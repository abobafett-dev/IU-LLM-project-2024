It incorporates gamification elements to increase participation and foster a sense of community among members. The model consists of eight levels of Good Ways and their respective sets, with 205 indices defining the totality of human cognition (Pure Ontology).\n\nThe model is based on commonalities found in ontological, phenomenological, and epistemological research across various cultures and time periods. The goal is to encourage members to incorporate the principles of good governance into their daily lives and contribute to positive change in their communities.\n\nMore info: https://crisisresolutions.com/",
