  "descriptionNullable": "**Context**\nAdult diffuse gliomas are classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as astrocytic tumors of grades II and III, oligodendrogliomas of grades II and III, and glioblastomas of grade IV. Grade IV glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and deadly kind of glioma. It invades adjacent brain regions but rarely spreads to other parts of the body. Less than 5% of patients with GBM survive 5 years after diagnosis, according to clinical statistics, indicating a poor prognosis.\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F3512421%2F8cffb83961834e7306bf46aac1caba7b%2FDataset%20description%20demos.png?generation=1715261363123882&alt=media)\n\n**Content**\nWe used four databases to construct a model for detecting the severity of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) using an Image Residual Agnostics Meta Learning Network (IRAM\u2013NET) model. The four large datasets used in our study were obtained from \u2013\n1. The University of California San Francisco Preoperative Diffuse Glioma MRI (UCSF-PDGM) dataset. A total of 501 patients with clinically confirmed diffuse gliomas are included in this data collection. These individuals had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed before surgery on a brain tumor, with the focus being on 3D imaging. Imaging techniques including diffusion and perfusion were included in this procedure.\n2. The dataset consists of high-resolution MRI images obtained from a group of 30 adult patients with brain glioma. These images were acquired using a 3 Tesla Philips scanner at the Neuroradiology Unit and CERMAC (Centre of Excellence for High Field Magnetic Resonance), located at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University and IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele in Milano, Italy. The acquisition process is conducted within the framework of the European Union's Horizon EDEN2020 project, specifically as a component of the efforts towards Deliverable D2.2, which pertains to the Human Brain Imaging Database.\n3. The dataset was acquired from a cohort of 20 recurrent patients who received surgical intervention for glioblastoma. The images obtained at magnetic field strengths of 1.5 or 3 Tesla were retrospectively retrieved from the radiology database at St. Olav's University Hospital. Three distinct scanner systems were utilized to conduct magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The study's exclusion criteria encompassed several factors, including prior brain tumor surgery or chemotherapy, non-contrast-enhancing tumors, gliomatosis cerebri, and the unavailability or unsuitability of preoperative MRI images.\n4. The high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) datasets of a group of 15 healthy adult participants were obtained using a 3T scanner at the Neuroradiology Unit and CERMAC (Centre of Excellence for High Field Magnetic Resonance), located at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University and IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milano, Italy.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\nThe original files are located here: \n1. https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/ucsf-pdgm/\n2. https://zenodo.org/records/5714812\n3. https://archive.norstore.no/pages/public/datasetDetail.jsf?id=10.11582/2016.00004\n4. https://zenodo.org/records/3994749\n\n**Cite our work**\nKuljeet Singh, Deepti Malhotra, \u201cIRAM\u2013NET Model: Image Residual Agnostics Meta Learning based Network for Rare De Novo Glioblastoma Diagnosis\u201d Neural Computing and Applications, 2024.",
