You can learn **Image preprocessing** though this dataset. Because the images are of non-similar dimensions like (1350, 1200, 4), (1073, 925, 3), (360, 360) etc. \n\n3. Be cautious at applying **Data augmentation** in cases like symbol classification, where the orientation of an image is an identity of it. For example, rotating a Hindu's sacred symbol, Swastika, can turn out to be Nazi's symbol.\n\n\nPS: For wise people religion is a wake to make friends- DR APJ ABDUL KALAM.  So if you find any error in labelling then you can bring my attention. Also you can tell me to add more symbols",
