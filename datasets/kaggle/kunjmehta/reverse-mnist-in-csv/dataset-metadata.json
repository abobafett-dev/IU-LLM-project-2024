However, the same dataset can be used in reverse fashion to train a neural network like GAN to generate 'handwritten' digit images.\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset contains 4 files corresponding to the features and labels for both the training and test set. This allows for easy load-and-train and relieves the user from doing data manipulation. As mentioned [here](url), the images (labels in the image generation case) are represented in a flattened manner with each column representing a pixel in the 28x28 sized image. Also, the original labels (features in the image generation case) have been one-hot encoded for use in training for image generation.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe CSV format of the original MNIST dataset has been taken from [here](url)",
