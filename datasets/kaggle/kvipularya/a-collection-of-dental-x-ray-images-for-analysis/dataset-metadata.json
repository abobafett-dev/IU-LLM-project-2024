  "descriptionNullable": "Dental imaging plays a pivotal role in diagnosing oral health conditions, guiding treatment plans, and enhancing patient care. This meticulously curated dataset features a diverse collection of orthopantomogram (OPG) teeth X-ray images, comprising 70 high-quality samples sourced from local hospitals and trusted acquaintances. With annotations provided, this dataset is primed for training and testing machine learning models for dental image analysis tasks such as tooth type classification, anomaly detection, and more. Inspired by the burgeoning field of computer vision and driven by the need for improved diagnostic tools in dentistry, this dataset aims to empower researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts to explore innovative solutions for enhancing oral healthcare outcomes",
