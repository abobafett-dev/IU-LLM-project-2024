As a result, a vast number of cases go unreported.\n\nThe Washington Post is tracking more than a dozen details about each killing - including the race, age and gender of the deceased, whether the person was armed, and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis. They have gathered this information from law enforcement websites, local new reports, social media, and by monitoring independent databases such as \"Killed by police\" and \"Fatal Encounters\". The Post has also conducted additional reporting in many cases.\n\nThere are four additional datasets. These are US census data on poverty rate, high school graduation rate, median household income, and racial demographics. \n\nSource of census data:\nhttps://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml",
