In the \u201cData\u201d tab above, you\u2019ll find the annotated data, with 40 class labels for intent and content.\n\nThis dataset contains the original message in its original language, the English translation, and dozens of classes for message content. These classes are noted in column titles with a simple binary 1= yes, 2=no.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nUpon release, this is the featured dataset of a new Udacity course on Data Science and the AI4ALL summer school and is especially utile for text analytics and natural language processing (NLP) tasks and models.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nA set of messages related to disaster response, covering multiple languages, suitable for text categorization and related natural language processing tasks.",
