  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\nAction Recognition in video is known to be more challenging than image recognition problems. Unlike image recognition models which use 2D convolutional neural blocks, action classification models require additional dimensionality to capture the spatio-temporal information in video sequences. This intrinsically makes video action recognition models computationally intensive and significantly more data-hungry than image recognition counterparts. Unequivocally, existing video datasets such as Kinetics, AVA, Charades, Something-Something, HMDB51, and UFC101 have had tremendous impact on the recently evolving video recognition technologies. Artificial Intelligence models trained on these datasets have largely benefited applications such as behavior monitoring in elderly people, video summarization, and content-based retrieval. However, this growing concept of action recognition has yet to be explored in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), particularly in vital applications such as incidents detection. This is partly due to the lack of availability of annotated dataset adequate for training models suitable for such direct ITS use cases. In this paper, the concept of video action recognition is explored to tackle the problem of highway incident detection and classification from live surveillance footage. First, a novel dataset - HWID12 (Highway Incidents Detection) dataset is introduced. The HWAD12 consists of 11 distinct highway incidents categories, and one additional category for negative samples representing normal traffic. The proposed dataset also includes 2780+ video segments of 3 to 8 seconds on average each, and 500k+ temporal frames. Next, the baseline for highway accident detection and classification is established with a state-of-the-art action recognition model trained on the proposed HWID12 dataset. Performance benchmarking for 12-class (normal traffic vs 11 accident categories), and 2-class (incident vs normal traffic) settings is performed. This benchmarking reveals a recognition accuracy of up to 88% and 98% for 12-class and 2-class recognition setting, respectively.\n\n\n\n### Data Acquisition\nThe Proposed Highway Incidents Detection Dataset (HWID12) is the first of its kind dataset aimed at fostering experimentation of video action recognition technologies to solve the practical problem of real-time highway incident detections which currently challenges intelligent transportation systems.\nThe lack of such dataset has limited the expansion of the recent breakthroughs  in video action classification for practical uses cases in intelligent transportation systems..\nThe proposed dataset contains more than 2780 video clips of length varying between 3 to 8 seconds.
