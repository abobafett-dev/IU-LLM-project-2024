(check out [my website](http://whatsthatpokemon.com) if you are interested, it's kind of buggy but mostly functioning) I couldn't find any usable datasets online so I made my own by going through every image in [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thedagger/pokemon-generation-one), cropping each image, and removing falsely labeled ones , which was pretty painful and took me many hours but the results are great.\n\n\n### Content\n\nAll the 150 Pokemons included in this dataset are from generation one. There are around 25 - 50 images for each Pokemon. All of them with the Pokemon in the center. Most (if not all) of the images have relatively high quality (correct labels, centered). The images don't have extremely high resolutions so it's perfect for some light deep learning.",
