This information enables researchers to investigate the prevalence of illicit practices within the cryptocurrency domain.  \nSentiment, polarity and subjectivity criteria were generated using TextBlob.  \nThis example dataset was collected using a news web-scrapper https://github.com/LaraCodesmith/crypto-news-scraper.",
