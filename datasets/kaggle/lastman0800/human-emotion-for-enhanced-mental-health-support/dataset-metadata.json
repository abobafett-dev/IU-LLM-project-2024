  "descriptionNullable": "Participant_ID: This is a numerical identifier for each participant in the study or survey. It seems to be a unique identifier for each row.\n\nAge: This column represents the age of the participants. The data type is numerical.\n\nGender: This field indicates the gender of the participants. From the sample, it includes categories like 'Male', 'Female', and 'Non-binary'.\n\nAnxiety_Level: A numerical score indicating the level of anxiety experienced by the participant. The scale or range of this score isn't clear from the initial rows, but it's likely to be a standardized measure.\n\nDepression_Level: Similar to the Anxiety_Level, this is a numerical score representing the level of depression. Again, the scale is not immediately clear.\n\nEmpathy_Score: This seems to be a numerical score reflecting the participant's level of empathy. The methodology or scale used to determine this score isn't evident from the data provided here.\n\nAI_Response_Score: This is likely a score related to a response or interaction with an AI system, perhaps measuring the effectiveness or satisfaction with an AI response. The exact nature of this score is not detailed in the snippet provided.",
