This country has diverse climates and ecological floors, where various crops have been developed. In this way, it has a lot of natural and unique inputs. So, peruvian food is a cuisine of opposites: hot and cold on the same plate. Acidic tastes melding with the starchy. Robust and delicate at the same time. This balance occurs because traditional Peruvian food relies on spices and bold flavors, ranging from the crisp and clean to the heavy and deep. Each flavor counters or tames the other. While many people see Peru as a land of cloud-topped mountains and ruins of ancient civilizations, Peru\u2019s true treasure is its rich culinary heritage. Ingredients and cooking techniques from Africa, Europe, and East Asia come together in a delightful melange that is utterly unique the world over. But what kind of food do Peruvians eat?

More info about the used web-scraping in this [github repository](https://github.com/Lazaro-97/satisfaction-in-restaurants)\nThe content here have a lot (at the moment not all) of restaurants reviews in Lima, Peru between 2010 and 2021. In total exist more of 8791 restaurants and more of 1160666 reviews. With a total of 20 features with a high diversity: geospatial, text, date ,categoric and numeric feafures!\n\nThis has two general sections. The first is the *Restaurants*. This contains general and geospatial information.  The second is the *Reviews*. This contains the interaction between user and restaurant, with this way is possible to see the satisfaction of the client with a service.\nExist a possible third section: the *Users*. This information maybe will be added in two months.\n\nAbout the collection methodology, this is explained below:\n\n-**The sample:** The scraped reviews are the most recent reviews in all possible restaurants in the province of Lima. \n\n-**Set of items:** In one way, the users. In other way: the restaurants.\n\n-**Set of variables:** Exist two general tables. See the information below\n\nThe following diagram and table summarise all.\n\n**Table 1:** Restaurants\n|Variable|Description|\n| --- | ---|\n| Id | Id of the restaurant |\n|Name| Name of the restaurant |\n|Tag| The category of the restaurant |\n|x, y| Geospatial information and exact location of restaurant |\n|District|District where the restaurant is located |\n|Direction|District where the restaurant is located|\n|Stars|Mean Stars of restaurant in all time|\n|N_reviews|Number of reviews of restaurant in all time |\n|Min_Price| Minimum price in the menu of restaurant |\n|Max_Price| Maximum price in the menu of restaurant |\n|Platform| Platform where the information was downloaded |\n\n**Table 2:** Reviews\n\n|Variable|Description|\n| --- | ---|\n| Id_review | Id of the review |\n|Id_nick| Id of the user.

This probabilities was obtained with a Spanish NrcLexicon, however, that results is not ok. Anyway, that is a reference and you can propose a fine tuning here. In adittion, also exist the probability to get a specific star, however, this was obtained with a simple logistic regression. Also i showed the information about Spanish NrcLexicon and Geospatial Borders.
