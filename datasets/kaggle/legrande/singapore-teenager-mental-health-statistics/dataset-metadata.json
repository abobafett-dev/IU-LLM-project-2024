  "descriptionNullable": "The rising trend in Singaporean teenager suicidal cases reflects a concerning societal issue, with the numbers steadily increasing over the past few years. In 2022, the total cases reached 429, marking a continuous uptick since 2018. The consistent year-on-year rise suggests a complex interplay of various factors impacting the mental well-being of teenagers, including academic pressure, social expectations, and the challenges posed by the modern digital landscape. Addressing this alarming trend requires a comprehensive approach that involves not only mental health support but also broader societal measures to create a more supportive and understanding environment for teenagers.\nThe 12-month prevalences of psychiatric disorders based on age groups in 2022 underscore a notable variation in mental health challenges across different life stages. Among individuals aged 15-22, 7% of the population reported experiencing any psychiatric disorder, indicating a higher prevalence in this younger age bracket. The prevalence decreases in older age groups, with 4.9% for ages 23-30, 0.5% for ages 31-50, and 0.7% for those aged 50 and above. These findings highlight the importance of targeted mental health interventions, especially for adolescents and young adults, while acknowledging the evolving nature of mental health needs across the lifespan. Understanding these age-specific patterns can inform tailored strategies for prevention, early intervention, and support across diverse age demographics.",
