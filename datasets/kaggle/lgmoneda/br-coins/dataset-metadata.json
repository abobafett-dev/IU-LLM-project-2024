  "descriptionNullable": "# Context \n\nThese datasets were created for college course work. It was an opportunity to test Deep Learning capabilities for computer vision in a very restricted problem.\n\nThe idea is to explore a classification problem for a single coin and a regression problem for a group of coins, trying to count how much money they sum.  You can see my initial approach [here](https://github.com/lgmoneda/tio-pytinhas).\n\n# Content\n\nThere are two datasets. One for classification and another for regression. The first contains 3000 images with just a single coin in it. The second contains the first one and another 3000 images with two or more coins present in each example.\n\nIn the classification problem, there are five classes: 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 cents. For regression, there are examples from 5 to 175 cents.\n\nEvery file contains its value in money as its filename. For example, 5_1477146780.jpg contains a single 5 cents coin. If there's only one coin, it's the coin value itself. In the 80_1477851090.jpg you're going to find enough coins to sum 80 cents. An example (90_1477854720.jpg):\n\n![90 exemple][2]\n\nDifferent coins from each type were used to make it more interesting. My fingers appear in some images!\n\nI tried to keep the distance, illumination, and background constant for all of them, but some differences will be noticed, especially in the illumination. Changing the coin position has a great impact on how the light reflects over it. The structure used to take the pictures (in fact, a second light source was added):\n\n![The structured used to take pictures of the coins][1]\n\n# Inspiration\n\nA model that can sum coins and tell how much money we have in a group of coins could be used for people with vision disabilities. Can Deep Learning count, classify, and sum in a single model? Should we split the problem into segmentation, classification, and then sum it? What can be done with this amount of data? Can we achieve good generalization and predict sums beyond the dataset's greatest value?\n\n# Annotations\n\nA second version of the dataset is available with annotations thanks to David Yonekura and Ello\u00e1 Guedes. \n\n&gt; The labelme format consists of one json per image, where the labels can assume one of two types: circle or polygon; A circle label has a center and edge point, and a polygon is a set of points (Polygons where used for partial coins). \n\n&gt; The COCO format consists of a single json for the dataset.\n\nFor further information, please check the [IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/brazilian-coin-detection-dataset). \n\n# Citation\n\nFor the annotated dataset, please use the following reference:\n\n@data{kj4c-y809-20,\ndoi = {10.21227/kj4c-y809},\nurl = {http://dx.doi.org/10.21227/kj4c-y809},\nauthor = {Luis Moneda; David Yonekura; Ello\u00e1 Guedes },\npublisher = {IEEE Dataport},\ntitle = {Brazilian Coin Detection Dataset},\nyear = {2020} } \n\nFor the older version, If you want to use this dataset for any purpose contemplated by its license, add the reference:\n\nMONEDA, L.
