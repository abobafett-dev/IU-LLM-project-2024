Data is verified, cleansed, analyzed and aggregated.\n\n- No \"private\" information is being used. Names, photographs, listings and review details are all publicly displayed on the Airbnb site.\n\n- Airbnb claims \"fair use\" of any information compiled in producing a non-commercial derivation to allow public analysis, discussion and community benefit.\n\n- Accuracy of the information compiled from the Airbnb site is not the responsibility of Inside Airbnb. Due care has been taken with any processing and analysis.\n\n- Listings can be deleted in the Airbnb platform. The data presented here is a snapshot of listings available at a particular time.\n\n- The Airbnb calendar for a listing does not differentiate between a booked night vs an unavailable night, therefore these bookings have been counted as \"unavailable\". This serves to understate the Availability metric because popular listings will be \"booked\" rather than being \"blacked out\" by a host.\n\n- Some hosts might not keep their calendar updated, or have it highly available even though they live in the entire home/apartment.\n\n- Neighbourhood names for each listing are compiled by comparing the listing's geographic coordinates with a city's definition of neighbourhoods. Airbnb neighbourhood names are not used because of their inaccuracies.\n\n- All copyright and registered trademarks remain the property of their owners.",
