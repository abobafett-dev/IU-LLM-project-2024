  "descriptionNullable": "# Description:\n\nThe Bank of England Individual Write-off Dataset is a comprehensive and meticulously curated collection of time-series data spanning the period from 1993 to 2023. This dataset provides valuable insights into the dynamics of write-off activities related to individuals' financial transactions, encompassing various credit facilities. The primary focus of the dataset is on write-off occurrences in the domains of secured credit, credit cards, and other unsecured credit facilities.\n\n# Key Features:\n\n**Time Range (1993-2023):** The dataset covers a substantial 30-year period, allowing users to analyze long-term trends, patterns, and fluctuations in individual write-off data.\n\n**Granular Time Series:** Time series data is available at a granular level, providing monthly or quarterly breakdowns of write-off events. This level of detail enables users to identify seasonal trends, economic cycles, and other time-dependent patterns.\n\n**Secured Credit:** The dataset includes detailed information on write-offs related to secured credit. This encompasses loans and financial transactions backed by collateral, such as mortgages and other secured assets.\n\n**Credit Cards:** A specific focus is given to write-offs associated with credit card transactions. This subset of data provides insights into consumer behavior, credit card usage trends, and the risk factors contributing to write-off events.\n\n**Other Unsecured Credit Facilities:** Beyond secured credit and credit cards, the dataset also encompasses other unsecured credit facilities. This category includes personal loans, lines of credit, and other financial instruments without collateral requirements.\n\n**Detailed Write-off Metrics:** The dataset provides comprehensive metrics related to write-offs, such as the amount written off, the reasons for write-offs, and potentially demographic information of the individuals involved. This allows for a nuanced understanding of the factors contributing to write-off events.",
