  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nThis is the data related to the Digimon in Bandai\u2019s Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition (both Cyber Sleuth and Hacker\u2019s Memory games). Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth is a role-playing game, played from a third-person perspective where players control a human character with the ability to command Digimon, digital creatures with their own unique abilities who do battle against other Digimon. The Complete Edition includes the 92 new Digimon from Hacker's Memory, for a total of 341 Digimon.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains 5 different tables; *Digimon*, *Digivolutions*, *Digivolution Requirements*, *Skills* and *Skills by Digimon*.\n\n\n### Digimon\n\nThis table has all the Digimon in the game with their respective stats.\n\n- **Number** : The Digimon\u2019s unique number (1 to 341)\n- **Digimon**: The name of the Digimon\n- **Stage**: The stage of the Digimon (Baby, In-Training, Rookie, Champion, Ultimate, Mega, Ultra, Armor, None)\n- **Type**: The type of the Digimon (Free, Vaccine, Virus, Data)\n- **Attribute**: The attribute of the Digimon (Fire, Water, Plant, Earth, Wind, Electric, Light, Dark, Neutral)\n- **Memory**: The quantity of memory the Digimon takes in the team\n- **Equip Slots** : The number of equip slots for items the Digimon has\n- **HP lvl 1** : The amount of HP the Digimon has at lvl 1\n- **SP lvl 1** : The amount of SP the Digimon has at lvl 1\n- **ATK lvl 1** : The amount of ATK the Digimon has at lvl 1\n- **DEF lvl 1** : The amount of DEF the Digimon has at lvl 1\n- **INT lvl 1** : The amount of INT the Digimon has at lvl 1\n- **SPD lvl 1** : The amount of SPD the Digimon has at lvl 1\n- **HP lvl 50** : The amount of HP the Digimon has at lvl 50\n- **SP lvl 50** : The amount of SP the Digimon has at lvl 50\n- **ATK lvl 50** : The amount of ATK the Digimon has at lvl 50\n- **DEF lvl 50** : The amount of DEF the Digimon has at lvl 50\n- **INT lvl 50** : The amount of INT the Digimon has at lvl 50\n- **SPD lvl 50** : The amount of SPD the Digimon has at lvl 50\n- **HP lvl 99** : The amount of HP the Digimon has at lvl 99\n- **SP lvl 99** : The amount of SP the Digimon has at lvl 99\n- **ATK lvl 99** : The amount of ATK the Digimon has at lvl 99\n- **DEF lvl 99** : The amount of DEF the Digimon has at lvl 99\n- **INT lvl 99** : The amount of INT the Digimon has at lvl 99\n- **SPD lvl 99** : The amount of SPD the Digimon has at lvl 99\n\nNote: All these stats do NOT count stat boosts by digi-farm training\n\n\n### Digivolutions\n\nThis table has all the pairs of possible digivolutions \u2013 (Digivolves from -&gt; Digivolves to)\n\n\u2022\t**Number**: The number of the digivolving Digimon\n\u2022\t**Digivolves from** : The name of the digivolving Digimon\n\u2022\t**Digivolves to** : The name of the Digimon obtained from the digivolution\n\n\n### Digivolution Requirements\n\nThis table shows the stats needed to obtain any digivolution. Note: there are null values in this table as not all digivolutions have requirements in all stats.\n\n\u2022\t**Number** : The number of the Digimon obtained from the digivolution\n\u2022\t**Digimon** : The name of the Digimon obtained from the digivolution\n\u2022\t**Level** : The level needed for the digivolving Digimon to unlock the digivolution\n\u2022\t**HP** : The HP needed for the digivolving Digimon to unlock the digivolution\n\u2022\t**SP** : The SP needed for the digivolving Digimon to unlock the digivolution\n\u2022\t**ATK** : The ATK needed for the digivolving Digimon to unlock the digivolution\n\u2022\t**DEF** : The DEF needed for the digivolving Digimon to unlock the digivolution\n\u2022\t**SPD** : The SPD needed for the digivolving Digimon to unlock the digivolution\n\u2022\t**ABI** : The ABI needed for the digivolving Digimon to unlock the digivolution\n\u2022\t**CAM** : The CAM% needed for the digivolving Digimon to unlock the digivolution\n\u2022\t**Extra Condition** : A comment or an extra condition needed for the digivolution. Ex: Some Digimon need a certain item for the digivolution to unlock; some are a DNA digivolution and need 2 digimon\n\n**Example** : Agumon can digivolve to Greymon. In the Greymon row, we can see all the stats Agumon needs to unlock Greymon. Note that other digimon can also digivolve to Greymon. The requirements for those digimon are the same as for Agumon. This goes for any digivolution in the table. \n\n\n### Skills\n\nThis table shows all the skills in game and their characteristics. \n\n\u2022\t**Skill** : The name of the skill\n\u2022\t**SP Cost** : The cost of SP to use the skill\n\u2022\t**Type** : The type of the skill (Physical, Magic, Support, Fixed, Direct)\n\u2022\t**Power** : The power of the skill\n\u2022\t**Attribute** : The attribute of the skill (Fire, Water, Plant, Earth, Wind, Electric, Light, Dark, Neutral)\n\u2022\t**Inheritable** : If the skill is inheritable throughout the digivolutions\n\u2022\t**Description** : A description of the skill\n\n\n### Skills by Digimon\n\nThis table pairs Digimon names and their skills. This means a Digimon\u2019s name can appear multiple times; it will appear for the number of skills it has.\n\n\u2022\t**Number** : The number of the Digimon\n\u2022\t**Digimon** : The name of the Digimon\n\u2022\t**Skill** : The name of the skill\n\u2022\t**Level** : At what level the skill is learned by the Digimon\n\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe data has mostly been gathered from the [DigiBD website](http://digidb.io/). I would recommend checking it out for more detailed information about each Digimon and for more tools and charts related to Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThis game is one of my absolute favorites. I have put countless hours in it and there is so much room for data analysis or creation of tools with the Digimon data. One tool I had in mind that could be useful was a digivolution tool. In this game, all Digimon have an evolution path to any other Digimon. When playing, I wanted to unblock all Digimon and I would make lists about which Digimon still had an unblocked digivolution. I would then note the Digimon I already had in my bank, open the menus, and find the evolution path that would bring me to the unblocked digivolution. What if I had a tool that could find this path for me?* Also, what if I want a specific Digimon with a specific skill? I could find the evolution path that would first get to a Digimon with the skill needed, and then bring it back to the Digimon I want. What if I want the evolution path to Digimon A without passing by Digimon B because of the ABI it would cost? I could find that too. There is also room for basic data analysis, like finding the best Digimon by stat (HP, SP, ATK, DEF, INT, SPD), the best rookie, champion, ultimate or mega\u2026 and so much more!\n\nI also have many tables with the Digimon column, so this data can help with practicing joining tables. I also have null data in the Digivolution Requirement table, so it can also help practice dealing with null values.\n\nAnother element that could be interesting for analysis is determining if a Digimon needs to use the digi-farm to get to a certain digivolution. Ex: if my Digimon needs 200 ATK for an evolution, but his ATK caps at 190 at lvl 99, my Digimon would need to put 10 points in ATK with the digi-farm. Also, does the Digimon have enough training points left to put that many in ATK? All Digimon start with 50 free training points, and you get more by increasing ABI \u2013 1 training point for every 2 ABI. The general formula for available training points is (ABI/2) + 50 and the maximum limit for ABI in Cyber Sleuth Complete Edition is 200. I would recommend reading [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberSleuth/comments/esbyku/abi_guide/) about ABI to understand it more and how it is gained.\n\n*Note that I had found a tool online that did exactly this (the [DigiPath Finder](http://37.97.147.73/DigiPathFinder.htm)), but I am still interested to see if it can be replicated.
