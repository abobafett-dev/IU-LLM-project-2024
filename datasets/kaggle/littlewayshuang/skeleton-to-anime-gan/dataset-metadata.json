  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nFollowing the  \"[Everybody Dance Now](https://github.com/topics/everybody-dance-now)\" topic, we tried to make anime character move as we move. We provided 3 sets of different [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) characters for this image generation task. \nA generator-discriminator network was built for training anime image generation from key points for each character. The network was trained on each pair of the image and the corresponding keypoints o of the character's pose. Each keypoint set should be able to generate the image of the specific anime character with the same pose.\nHope you enjoy teaching these characters to dance!\n\n### Content\n\nThe images were fetched from Mixamo and resized to 512x512 size. There are more than 4000 images for each character with different poses.  The corresponding keypoints (facial features, joints, ...) were generated by [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose):\n1. 70 facial keypoints\n2. 25 body keypoints\n3. 21 left-hand keypoints\n4. 21 right-hand keypoints\nSpecific keypoint assignment can be found at [openpose doc file](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/output.md)\n\n### Further Discription\nhttps://hackmd.io/@usmile/Bkn9Vz-7P\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks for the opportunity provided by [Taiwan AI Academy](https://en.aiacademy.tw/) for us to form a study group of GAN. Thanks to Eric for inviting all the members to the group.

Inspired by this project, we proposed to automatically replace someone in the photo with the specific anime character with the same pose.",
