  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset is curated for the purpose of detecting and classifying four distinct types of rice leaf diseases: Hispa, Brown Spot, Leaf Blast, Leaf Scaled,Narraow brown spot and Neck Blast. Each category represents a specific pathology affecting rice plants. The dataset provides annotated images to facilitate the training and evaluation of machine learning models aimed at automating the detection of these diseases. Researchers and enthusiasts in the field of agricultural technology and plant pathology can leverage this dataset to develop robust solutions for early diagnosis and effective management of rice crop health.",
