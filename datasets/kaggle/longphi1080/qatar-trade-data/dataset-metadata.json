At the time of compiling this data, the blockade was still in place, though Qatar appeared to have been coping with the crisis well. The blockade ended in January 2021.\n\n### Content\n\nThis is a balanced dataset of every single thing Qatar imported from 2015 - 2018, from hat pegs to cow milk.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nHow exactly did a tiny country withstand a blockade from its biggest trading partners?",
