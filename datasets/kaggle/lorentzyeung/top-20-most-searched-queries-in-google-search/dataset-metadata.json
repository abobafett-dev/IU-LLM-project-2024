One major challenge we data analysts encountered was the difficulty in understanding the significance of specific events from several months or even years prior. Although we could employ various filtering mechanisms to sift through news articles, it was still a challenge to gauge whether a subject was a trending topic at that time.\n\nTo address this, I developed a Python-based web scraping utility. This tool captures the top 20 search results from various countries\u2014specifically the US, UK, Germany (DE), France (FR), Netherlands (NL), Italy (IT), and Australia (AUS)\u2014and stores them in my personal SQL database. \n\nIt's worth noting that there are gaps in the collected data, owing to a range of unforeseen circumstances such as power outages, residential moves, and server maintenance among others.\n\nYou are welcome to use this dataset for various types of analysis. For example, you could examine how long public sentiment around a particular event, like the outbreak of the Ukrainian War, remains prevalent in a specific country, like the United States.\n\nI plan to update this dataset on a monthly basis and will also release past datasets for further scrutiny.",
