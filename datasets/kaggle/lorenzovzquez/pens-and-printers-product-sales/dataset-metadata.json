We are a trusted provider of everything from pens and notebooks to desk\nchairs and monitors. We don\u2019t produce our own products but sell those made by other\ncompanies.\n\nWe have built long lasting relationships with our customers and they trust us to provide them\nwith the best products for them. As the way in which consumers buy products is changing,\nour sales tactics have to change too. Launching a new product line is expensive and we need\nto make sure we are using the best techniques to sell the new product effectively. The best\napproach may vary for each new product so we need to learn quickly what works and what\ndoesn\u2019t.\n\n### New Product Sales Methods\n\nSix weeks ago we launched a new line of office stationery. Despite the world becoming\nincreasingly digital, there is still demand for notebooks, pens and sticky notes.\n\nOur focus has been on selling products to enable our customers to be more creative, focused\non tools for brainstorming. We have tested three different sales strategies for this, targeted\nemail and phone calls, as well as combining the two.\n\n**Email**: Customers in this group received an email when the product line was launched, and a\nfurther email three weeks later. This required very little work for the team.\n**Call**: Customers in this group were called by a member of the sales team. On average\nmembers of the team were on the phone for around thirty minutes per customer.\n**Email and call**: Customers in this group were first sent the product information email, then\ncalled a week later by the sales team to talk about their needs and how this new product\nmay support their work. The email required little work from the team, the call was around ten\nminutes per customer.\n\n## Information about the columns in the dataset:\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F7856604%2Fe051d7bc81494a713a73f10f43685810%2Fdata_information.png?generation=1697571836673174&alt=media)\n\n### Posible use of the dataset:\nThis dataset can be used to analyze the different sales method and define which one is the best for the company.
