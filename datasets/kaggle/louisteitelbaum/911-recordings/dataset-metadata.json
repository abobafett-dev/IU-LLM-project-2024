He describes his collection process as follows: \"I have posted these particular recordings because they represent examples of critical or unusual calls, and provide excellent second-hand experience for a public safety dispatcher. In many cases, a 911 call here might be the only time you\u2019ll ever encounter the situation being reported, such as an airline crash.\"\n\nRecordings (all in mp3 format) and brief text descriptions of each event were retrieved from an Internet Archive capture of the 911 Dispatch website, which is now defunct. Additional metadata (date, state, citizen initiated, deaths, potential death, and false alarm) were manually coded based on the descriptions, recordings, and additional news sources.\n\nMost recordings are of a single, full, uncensored 911 call. However, some begin in the middle, include censored material, or include multiple calls. Some also include brief intros, such as a dispatcher declaring that the recording is legitimate for use in a court case.",
