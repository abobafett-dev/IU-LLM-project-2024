Their notes on the data collected in the codebook.txt\n\nFrom Wikipedia: \n&gt; The empathizing\u2013systemizing (E\u2013S) theory is a theory on the psychological basis of autism and male\u2013female neurological differences originally put forward by English clinical psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen. It classifies individuals based on abilities in empathic thinking (E) and systematic thinking (S). It measures skills using an Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ) and attempts to explain the social and communication symptoms in autism spectrum disorders as deficits and delays in empathy combined with intact or superior systemizing.\n\n&gt; According to Baron-Cohen, the E\u2013S theory has been tested using the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ), developed by him and colleagues, and generates five different 'brain types' depending on the presence or absence of discrepancies between their scores on E or S. E\u2013S profiles show that the profile E&gt;S is more common in females than in males, and the profile S&gt;E is more common in males than in females.[1] Baron-Cohen and associates say the E\u2013S theory is a better predictor than gender of who chooses STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). The E\u2013S theory has been extended into the extreme male brain (EMB) theory of autism and Asperger syndrome, which are associated in the E\u2013S theory with below-average empathy and average or above-average systemizing.",
