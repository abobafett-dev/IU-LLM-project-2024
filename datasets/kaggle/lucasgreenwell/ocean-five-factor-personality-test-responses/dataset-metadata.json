The data was hosted on OpenPsychometrics.org a nonprofit effort to educate the public about psychology and to collect data for psychological research. Their notes on the data collected in the codebook.txt\n\nFrom Wikipedia: \n\n&gt; In psychological trait theory, the Big Five personality traits, also known as the five-factor model (FFM) and the OCEAN model, is a suggested taxonomy, or grouping, for personality traits, developed from the 1980s onwards. When factor analysis (a statistical technique) is applied to personality survey data, some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person. For example, someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as \"always prepared\" rather than \"messy\". This theory is based therefore on semantic associations between words and not on neuropsychological experiments. This theory uses descriptors of common language and suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche.\n\n&gt; The theory identifies five factors:\n\n&gt; openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)\n&gt; conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)\n&gt; extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)\n&gt; agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/callous)\n&gt; neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)\n&gt; The five factors are represented using the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE. Beneath each proposed global factor, there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors. For example, extroversion is typically associated with qualities such as gregariousness, assertiveness, excitement-seeking, warmth, activity, and positive emotions.\n\n&gt; Family life and the way someone was raised will affect these traits. Twin studies and other research have shown that about half of the variation between individuals results from their genetics and half from their environments. Researchers have found conscientiousness, extroversion, openness to experience, and neuroticism to be relatively stable from childhood through adulthood.",
