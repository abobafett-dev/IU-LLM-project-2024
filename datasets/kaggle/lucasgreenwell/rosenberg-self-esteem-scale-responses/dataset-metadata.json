The data was hosted on OpenPsychometrics.org a nonprofit effort to educate the public about psychology and to collect data for psychological research. Their notes on the data collected in the codebook.txt\n\nFrom Wikipedia: \n&gt; The Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES), developed by the sociologist Morris Rosenberg, is a self-esteem measure widely used in social-science research. It uses a scale of 0\u201340 where a score less than 15 may indicate a problematic low self esteem.\n\n&gt; The RSES is designed similar to the social-survey questionnaires. It is a ten-item Likert-type scale with items answered on a four-point scale\u2014from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Five of the items have positively worded statements and five have negatively worded ones. The scale measures global self-worth by measuring both positive and negative feelings about the self. The original sample for which the scale was developed consisted of 5,024 high-school juniors and seniors from 10 randomly selected schools in New York State. The Rosenberg self-esteem scale is considered a reliable and valid quantitative tool for self-esteem assessment.\n\n&gt; The RSES has been translated and adapted to various languages, such as Persian, French, Chinese, Italian, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. The scale is extensively used in cross-cultural studies in up to 53 different nations.",
