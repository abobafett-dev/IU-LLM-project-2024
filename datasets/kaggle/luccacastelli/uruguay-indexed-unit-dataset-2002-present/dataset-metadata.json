Introduced in 2003, it is tied to the country's Consumer Price Index (CPI). The UI's value is adjusted daily based on inflation rates, making it a reliable store of value. It is commonly used for long-term contracts, such as real estate transactions and loans, providing stability and protecting borrowers from inflation risks. The UI has been successful in reducing financial uncertainty, allowing individuals and businesses to plan and budget effectively in an inflationary environment, thus contributing to Uruguay's economic stability.\n\nThe source is the National Institute of Statistics.
