Throughout much of the 20th century, Uruguay experienced high levels of inflation, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. Chronic inflation severely affected the purchasing power of citizens and eroded economic stability. However, starting in the 1990s, the country implemented measures to control inflation, including adopting an inflation targeting regime and a more prudent fiscal policy. These measures had a positive impact, achieving a significant reduction in inflation and greater economic stability in Uruguay in recent decades. Although challenges persist, the fight against inflation has been a key objective for the country, aiming to ensure sustainable growth and improve the well-being of its population.\n\nThis dataset was generated by the National Institute of Statistic of Uruguay.
