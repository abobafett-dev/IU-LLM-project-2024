I picked worldwide, Canada, US, Italy, Iran, Japan, South Korea and UK as the population. The dataset also includes data of Canada for the past 4 years, from 2016 to 2019.\n\nThe mental health related search terms are \"mental health\", \"depression\", \"anxiety\", \"ocd\", \"obsessive compulsive disorder\", \"insomnia\", \"panic attack\", \"counseling\", \"psychiatrist\".\n\nSearch interest is indicated by a number between 0 and 100, where 100 means the most popular point of time(by week), 1 means the least, and 0 no enough data.\n\nAll data is collected from Google Trends. I assumed, when searching the terms, users from countries other than English-speaking performed the search in their own language, and they typed the word correctly.",
