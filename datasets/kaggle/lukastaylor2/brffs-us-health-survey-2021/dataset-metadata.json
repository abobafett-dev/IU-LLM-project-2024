Established in 1984 with 15 states, BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories.

Currently, there is a wide sponsorship of the BRFSS survey, including most divisions in the CDC National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; other CDC centers; and federal agencies, such as the Health Resources and Services Administration, Administration on Aging, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\" - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, About BRFFS\n\nPermission to reproduce material:\n\n\"Generally, data and materials produced by federal agencies are in the public domain and may be reproduced without permission.
