After this, count how many hairs that fell on your hand. Under 3(Low) means normal hair fall-off, a 4-6(Medium) means you have a slight hair loss symptom, if it's 6-10(Many) means you are experiencing hair losses, and over 10(A lot) indicates that you could have serious hair loss symptoms.\n\n#### Scientifical test method: Pull Test and Tug Test\nThis simple test measures the severity of hair loss. During a pull test, a dermatologist grasps small sections of hair, about 40 strands, from different parts of the scalp and gently tugs. If six or more strands fall out, you have what\u2019s known as active hair loss.
