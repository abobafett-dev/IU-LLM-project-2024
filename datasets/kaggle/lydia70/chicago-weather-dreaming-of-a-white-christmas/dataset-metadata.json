  "descriptionNullable": "# **Intro**\nThe Christmas and Holiday Season has begun! For most people, the season is the most wonderful time of the year. Christmas decorations make your entire home festive, lights are everywhere, you have some quality time with your closest relatives, Christmas-themed movies are on TV, the weather outside could be delightful, and the holiday season is full of discounts, gift-giving, and huge sales.\n\nRecently, I found Christmas weather data online for Chicago. Will Chicago have a white Christmas in 2020? \n\n### **Content**\nThis dataset contains Chicago weather data at Christmas spanning over 148 years. The first observation is from 1871, and the last observation is from 2018.\nEach observation, or row, contains the lowest and highest temperature measured (in degrees Fahrenheit) each year. Also, it includes the frequency of precipitation, snowfall, and snow at Christmas (true = white Christmas, false = no white Christmas, not defined = missing data). I included the lowest and highest temperature in degrees Celsius, based on the formula given for conversion.\n\nThe city of Chicago had the snowiest Christmas in 1950. The coldest Christmas was in 1983, and the warmest Christmas was in 1982. \n\n### **Source and acknowledgment**\nData has been collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric weather service: https://www.weather.gov/.",
