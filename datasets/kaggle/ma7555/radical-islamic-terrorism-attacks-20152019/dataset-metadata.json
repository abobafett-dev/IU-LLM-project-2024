Incidents of deadly violence that are reasonably determined to have been committed out of religious duty - as interpreted by the perpetrator - are only included.  Islam needs to be a motive, but it need not be the only factor.\n\nFor example, the Munich mall shooting in July, 2016 was by a Muslim, but it is not on the list, because it was not inspired by a sense of religious duty. \n\nThe incidents were collected each day from public news sources.  There is no rumor or word-of-mouth involved.
