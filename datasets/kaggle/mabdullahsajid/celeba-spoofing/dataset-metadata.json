  "descriptionNullable": "**CelebA-Spoof Dataset**\n\nThe CelebA-Spoof dataset is a large-scale collection of face images designed for anti-spoofing research. It comprises 625,537 images sourced from 10,177 subjects, encompassing both live and spoofed images. The dataset is rich in attributes, with 43 annotations covering various facial components, illumination conditions, environments, and spoof types.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\nLive Images: Derived from the CelebA dataset, featuring 40 attributes covering facial components (e.g., skin, nose, eyes), accessories (e.g., hat, eyeglasses), and more.\nSpoof Images: Comprising 3 attributes related to spoof types, environments, and illumination conditions.\n\n**Applications:**\n1. CelebA-Spoof serves as a valuable resource for:\n2. Training and evaluating face anti-spoofing algorithms.\n3. Studying face presentation attacks.\n4. Conducting research on robustness and security in facial recognition systems.\n5. Accessibility on Kaggle:\nWe've made the CelebA-Spoof dataset available on Kaggle to facilitate easy access and utilization for researchers and practitioners. This enables seamless integration into machine learning workflows, experimentation, and model development.\n\n**References:**\nFor further details and updates, please refer to the official CelebA-Spoof webpage:\nhttps://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA/CelebA_Spoof.html\n\n**Note:** When using this dataset, kindly adhere to the usage policies and guidelines outlined on the official website.\n\n**Disclaimer:** The CelebA-Spoof dataset is provided for research purposes only. Any commercial use requires proper authorization from the dataset creators.",
