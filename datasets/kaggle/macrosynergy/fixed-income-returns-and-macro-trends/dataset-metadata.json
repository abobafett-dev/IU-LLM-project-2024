Morgan Macrosynergy Quantamental System. JPMaQS is a service that makes it easy to use quantitative-fundamental (quantamental) information for algorithmic trading, as well as for the development of discretionary trader support tools. The system allows for quick and cost-efficient backtesting of macro quantamental investment strategies. Full JPMaQS data and content are proprietary and offered to J.P. Morgan\u2019s institutional clients as a premium data and content service; however, Macrosynergy is dedicated to promoting economic knowledge to benefit the broader community. We are open to reviewing any potential study with this commitment in mind as long as the data is not used for trading and investment. Please visit here for details:  https://academy.macrosynergy.com/academia/\n\nMacrosynergy developed and maintains a free educational site https://academy.macrosynergy.com/strategies/, where we publish examples of how quantamental indicators can create simple trading strategies. This is an excellent resource for both aspiring and seasoned macro investors. \n\nFor more information on JPMaQS please visit https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/markets/macrosynergy-quantamental-system \n\n\n###The example dataset\n\nThe example dataset contains a small selection of quantamental indicators. JPMaQS data are usually available in panels, with one type of indicator (category) being available for a range of currency areas. The example notebook contains a few select categories for a subset of developed and emerging markets: AUD (Australian dollar), CAD (Canadian dollar), CHF (Swiss franc), CLP (Chilean peso), COP (Colombian peso), CZK (Czech Republic koruna), EUR (euro), GBP (British pound), HUF (Hungarian forint), IDR (Indonesian rupiah), ILS (Israeli shekel), INR (Indian rupee), JPY (Japanese yen), KRW (Korean won), MXN (Mexican peso), NOK (Norwegian krone), NZD (New Zealand dollar), PLN (Polish zloty), SEK (Swedish krona), TRY (Turkish lira), TWD (Taiwanese dollar), USD (U.S. dollar), ZAR (South African rand).\n\n\nShould users find the data inspiring, have questions or want to explore the full set of 5000+ unique macro quantamental indicators (available for JP Morgan clients), please email kaggle@macrosynergy.com.\n\n#Categories\n\n##Quantamental Indicators\n\n###Intuitive growth trends \n\n*Ticker:* **INTRGDP\\_NSA\\_P1M1ML12\\_3MMA / INTRGDPv5Y\\_NSA\\_P1M1ML12\\_3MMA**\n\n*Label:* Intuitive real GDP growth: % oya, 3mma / Excess intuitive real GDP growth trend: based on 5 year lookback\n\n*Definition:*  Latest estimable GDP growth trend based on actual national accounts and monthly activity data, based on sets of regressions that replicate conventional charting methods in markets (Macrosynergy methodology): % over a year ago, 3-month moving average / Latest estimated \"intuitive\" GDP growth trend, % over a year ago, 3-month moving average minus a long-term median of that country's actual GDP growth rate at that time: based on 5 year lookback of the latter \n\n*Notes:*\n\n- Each day on which a new economic indicator is released a full new vintage of monthly-frequency GDP growth rates (% over a year ago) is being estimated\n- For the __latest months__ of each vintage, for which national accounts data have not yet been published, GDP growth is estimated based on GLS (generalized least squares) regression. This regression predicts GDP growth for a month based on the relevant growth indicators that have so far been published and the autocorrelation effects of past error terms. This means that the error of that same regression for the latest reported quarter carries over into subsequent months. Errors of linear predictions of GDP growth based on a selected few growth indicators are often autocorrelated due to unobservable trends, typically related to sectors for which no data are available\n- For the older history of each vintage, for which national accounts have already bveen released, the official quarterly-frequency GDP growth rates are decomposed into monthly-frequency growth rates using OLS regression based on monthly activity indicators.\n- The candidate monthly-frequency indicators are pre-selected according to markets' popular economic release calendars and further narrowed down based their predictive power prior to the point in time at which the selection must have been done. Thus, there is statistical pre-selection based on prior training data. In summary, this means that the set of explanatory monthly-frequency activity indicators changes overtime according to (i) publication schedule and (ii) past predictive power\n- Only country-specific activity data are used for forestimating country growth. We would not use, for example, U.S. activity data to estimated Canadian growth. This allows differentiating growth information cleanly across countries, which is a good basis for building good relative growth indicators across countries\n- Important note: The quantamental series of a 3-month moving average, as presented here, is not the same as the 3-month moving average of a quantamental series. Instead the former is a 3-month moving average of the concurrently available vintage. Since the latest month and the previous months may be estimated based on different monthly-frequency data, depending on publication lag, the quantamental 3-month moving averages contain independent information and may look very different from the smoothed monthly quantamental series\n- The excess intuitive GDP growth trend subtracts a real-time 5-year or 10-year GDP growth median. This serves as a simplistic but fairly objective estimate for potential GDP growth at the time\n\n*Ticker:* **RGDP_SA_P1Q1QL4_20QMA**\n\n*Label:* Long-term real GDP growth: 5-year moving average\n\n*Definition:* Long-term real GDP growth, % over a year ago, based on trailing lookback window: 5-year (20 quarters) moving average\n\n*Notes:* \n\nThis average uses only quarterly national accounts data of the concurrently available vintage. For some older history where quarterly reports were not available, annual data history has been used\n\n###Consumer price inflation trends\n\n*Ticker:* **CPIH\\_SA\\_P1M1ML12** \n\n*Label:* Standard annual headline consumer price inflation\n\n*Definition:* Most widely watched consumer price measure of the currency area, % change of latest release over a year ago\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- Typically this inflation rate is based on the main CPI index of a country. In some countries other indices were used in the past, such as the UK (retail price index) and India (a wholesale price index)\n- The headline consumer price index is not necessarily the one preferred by the central bank, who may focus more on core or net inflation measures. However, it typically does have a great weight in the public discussion on inflation\n- The underlying data series are monthly with the exception of Australia and New Zealand\n- Australia and New Zealand only produce quarterly official CPIs. For Australia a monthly CPI inflation rate is estimated based on a monthly TD-MI Inflation Gauge. For New Zealand only the latest quarterly official CPI data are used\n\n\n*Ticker:* **CPIH\\_SJA\\_P3M3ML3AR / \\_P6M6ML6AR** \n\n*Label:* Adjusted headline consumer price trend: % 3m/3m ar / % 6m/6m ar\n\n*Definition:* Headline consumer price index, seasonally- and jump-adjusted: % of latest 3 months over previous 3 months at annualized rate / % of latest 6 months over previous 6 months at an annualized rate\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- Seasonal adjustment factors are sequentially re-estimated as new data are being released. This means a new data vintage is being created at every estimation\n- Jump adjustment means that two types of outliers are adjusted for. First, large \"spikes\" (i.e. two subsequent large moves of the seasonal index in opposite directions) are averaged. The causes for such spikes are often holiday shifts between two months, while the causes for jumps are mostly indirect taxes, administered prices or FX turbulences. Second, large one-off jumps in the index are replaced by the local trend. The criteria for adjustment are statistical based on pattern recognition\n- In most markets shorter-horizon price trends are watched mainly by market economists rather then the broader public\n- Australia and New Zealand only produce quarterly offical CPIs. For Australia a monthly CPI is estimated based on a monthly TD-MI Inflation Gauge. For New Zealand latest quarterly official CPI data are used\n\n\n\n*Ticker:* **CPIC_SA_P1M1ML12**\n\n*Label:* Annual core consumer price inflation\n\n*Definition:* Core consumer price index preferred by the central bank or market, % change of latest release over a year ago\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- Unlike headline consumer prices, this index is chosen based on local central bank or market convention rather than popular following.\n- The basic idea behind core price indices is to exclude volatile or erratic prices that cloud the detection of a trend. Often this means the exclusion of specific food and energy products from the basket\n- The basis for the adjustment is usually a consumer price index. An exception is the U.S. for which the central bank has preferred focusing on a price index of personal consumer expenditures\n- Australia and New Zealand only produce quarterly offical CPIs. For Australia a monthly CPI is estimated based on a monthly TD-MI Inflation Gauge (core measure, ex volatile items). For New Zealand latest quarterly official CPI data are used\n\nCore CPI here means CPI that excludes volatile price components according to preferred local convention. The list of excluded items by market can be checked on https://markets.jpmorgan.com/#jpmaqs (password protected)\n\n\n\n\n*Ticker:* **CPIC\\_SJA\\_P3M3ML3AR / CPIC\\_SJA\\_P6M6ML6AR**\n\n*Label:* Adjusted latest core consumer price trend: % 3m/3m ar / % 6m/6m ar\n\n*Definition:* Core consumer price index, seasonally and jump-adjusted: % of latest 3 months over previous 3 months at an annualized rate / % of latest 6 months over previous 6 months at an annualized rate\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- Seasonal adjustment factors are sequentially re-estimated as new data are released\n- Jump adjustment means that two types of outliers are adjusted. First, large \"spikes\" (i.e. two subsequent large moves of the seasonal index in opposite directions) are averaged. The causes for spikes are often holiday shifts between two months, while the causes for jumps are mostly indirect taxes, administered prices or FX turbulences. Second, large one-off jumps in the index are replaced by the local trend. The criteria for adjustment are statistical and based on pattern recognition\n\n###Inflation target\n\n*Ticker:* **INFTEFF_NSA / INFTARGET\\_NSA**\n\n*Label:* Effective official inflation target (Macrosynergy method), % over a year ago / Estimated extended official target for next year, % over a year ago\n\n*Definition:* Estimated offical inflation target for next year, adjusted for past target deviations. / Estimate of the inflation rate targeted by the government or central bank for the next calendar year, % over a year ago, extended to non-target years.\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- The effective inflation target is the estimated official inflation target plus an adjustment for past \"target misses\". This adjustment is the last 3 years' average gap between actual inflation and the estimated official target mean\n- The formula implies that central banks gradually lose credibility if they miss their targets consistently on either the high or low side for several years. However, the formula does not allow for a sudden loss in credibility, which may arise from a change in policy or policy annoucements\n\n- for **INFTARGET\\_NSA** The calculation of this category is largely similar to \"official inflation target\". However, for periods back to 2000 for which neither a formal nor informal target value was available, pro-forma estimates have been generated based on the average of (i) the past three years' median of CPI core and headline inflation and (ii) the global benchmark for price stability of 2%. This estimate is based on the idea that a generic country targets an inflation between its recent experienced price growth and what is commonly seen as price stability\n- The main purpose of this series is to have a full set of plausible target reference values across all developed and emerging countries back to 2000\n\n###Private credit expansion\n\n*Ticker:* **PCREDITBN\\_SJA\\_P1M1ML12**/**PCREDITGDP\\_SJA\\_D1M1ML12**\n\n*Label:* Private bank credit, jump-adjusted, % over a year ago/ Banks' private credit expansion, jump-adjusted, as % of GDP over 1 year\n\n*Definition:* Private bank credit at the end of the latest reported month, % change over a year ago, seasonal and jump-adjusted/ Change of private credit over 1 year ago, seasonal and jump-adjusted, as % of nominal GDP (1-year moving average) in the base period\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- For most countries the indicator is limited to bank loans to private households and companies\n- The stock of credit is denominated in local currency\n- Jump adjustment means that two types of outliers are adjusted for. First, large \"spikes\" (i.e. two subsequent large moves of the seasonal index in opposite directions) are averaged. The causes for spikes can holiday patterns or tax effects. Second, large one-off jumps in the index are replaced by the local trend. The causes of one-off jumps can be balance sheet restructurings in the banking systems and tax-related asset shifts. The criteria for adjustments are statistical, based on pattern recognition\n- For **PCREDITGDP\\_SJA\\_D1M1ML12** the expansion is calculated as the change in the stock of bank credit over the latest reported 12 months as % of the annual nominal GDP at the beginning of this 12 month period\n\n\n###Longer-term real IRS yields\n\n*Ticker:* **RYLDIRS02Y\\_NSA / RYLDIRS05Y\\_NSA**\n\n*Label:* Real IRS yield: 2-year maturity / 5-year maturity\n\n*Definition:* Main local interest rate swap yield minus inflation expectations: 2-year maturity / 5-year maturity\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- The nominal yield is the yield on a fixed receiver position in the main interest rate swaps contract traded in the currency area. Here inflation expectation is the 2-year or 5-year ahead ahead estimated inflation expectation according to Macrosynergy methodology. See notes on category tickers INFE2Y_JA and INFE5Y_JA on the page \"Inflation expectations (Macrosynergy methodology)\"\n\n##Generic returns\n\n###Duration Returns\n\n*Ticker:* **DU02YXR\\_NSA**/**DU05YXR\\_NSA**\n\n*Label:* Duration return, in % of notional: 2-year maturity / 5-year maturity\n\n*Definition:* Return on fixed receiver position in main interest rate swaps contract traded in the currency area, % of notional of the contract, daily roll: 2-year maturity / 5-year maturity\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- The interest rate derivative for most currency areas is an interest rate swap. For some EM countries (CNY, INR, KRW, THB, TWD) non-deliverable swaps have been used\n- The returns have been approximated as the sums of the yield spread between the fixed and floating leg and the daily change in yield times duration\n\n*Ticker:* **DU02YXR\\_VT10**/**DU05YXR\\_VT10**\n\n*Label:* Duration return for 10% vol target: 2-year maturity / 5-year maturity\n\n*Definition:* Return on fixed receiver position, % of risk capital on position scaled to 10% (annualized) volatility target, assuming monthly roll: 2-year maturity / 5-year maturity\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- Positions are scaled to 10% vol target based on historic standard deviation for an exponential moving average with a half-time of 11 days. Positions are rebalanced at the end of each month and constrained maximum leverage (notional to risk capital) of 20\n- See also related important notes on \"Duration return in % of notional\" (DU02YXR_NSA / DU05YXR_NSA)\n\n###FX forward returns\n\n*Ticker:* **FXXR\\_NSA**/**FXXR\\_VT10**\n\n*Label:*  FX forward return, % of notional: dominant cross / FX forward return for 10% vol target: dominant cross\n\n*Definition:* 1-month FX forward return, % of notional of the contract, assuming roll back to full 1-month maturity at the end of the month: long against natural benchmark currencies / 1-month FX forward return, % of risk capital on position scaled to 10% (annualized) volatility target, assuming roll back to full 1-month maturity at the end of the month: long against natural benchmark currencies\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- The default returns are calculated for a contract that is long the local currency of the cross section against its dominant traded benchmark. For most currencies the benchmark is the dollar. For some European currencies (CHF, CZK, HUF, NOK, PLN, RON, SEK) the benchmark is the euro. And for GBP, TRY, and RUB an equally weighted basked of dollar and euro has been used\n\n- For the following currencies returns are at least based on non-deliverable contracts: BRL, CLP, CNY, IDR, INR, KRW, MYR and TWD. CLP has become deliverable as of 2021\n- For some currencies the returns include periods of low liquidity and FX targeting. If one wishes to 'blacklist' such periods one should use the non-tradability and FX-target dummmies, which have category ticker codes \"FXUNTRADABLE_NSA\" and \"FXTARGETED_NSA\".\n- for **FXXR\\_VT10** Positions are scaled to 10% vol target based on historic standard deviation for an exponential moving average with a half-time of 11 days. Positions are rebalanced at the end of each month.Also, a maximum leverage ratio of 5 (of implied notional to cash position) is imposed\n\n\nReal carry versus dominant cross (no hedges)\n*Ticker:* **FXCRR_NSA**\n\n*Label*: Real forward-implied carry vs. dominant cross: % ar\n\n*Definition:* 1-month FX forward carry against dominant cross(es), % annualized and adjusted for expected inflation differential: based on notional of the contract\n\n*Notes:*\n\nIn contrast to nominal carry, real carry subtracts the differential between the expected local and benchmark inflation rate from annualized carry. The basis for the adjustment is the quantamental indicator \"Estimated 1-year ahead inflation expectation\" (INFE1Y_JA). The basis of these expectations are the dominant headline and core price indices (50-50) according to popular local conventions. \n\n### Exchange rate target dummy\n\n*Ticker*: **FXTARGETED_NSA**\n\n*Label:* Exchange rate target dummy\n\n*Definition:* Binary variable that takes the value 1 (rather than 0) if the exchange rate is targeted through a peg or any regime that significantly reduces exchange rate flexibility.\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- The exchange rate is considered targeted if the authorities have formally or informally set a peg, target corridor, cap or floor that is known in the market and expected to be defended by intervention and that significantly restricts the variation of the exchange rate.\n- The dummies are updated once per month at the end of the month based on the assessment of J.P. Morgan market makers and/or research. For example, if a target has been announced in the middle of the month the variable shifts from 0 to 1 at the end of this month.\n- Older history (prior to launch of JPMaQS)is based on heritage data of Macrosynergy Partners and, before that, replication of real-time liquidity and flexibility status based on an expert review.\nFX untradability dummy\n\n\n*Ticker*: **FXUNTRADABLE_NSA**\n\n*Label:* FX untradability dummy\n\n*Definition:* Binary variable that takes the value 1 (rather than 0) if either (i) liquidity in the main FX forward market is limited or (ii) convertibility restrictions significantly distort the link between tradable offshore and untradable onshore contracts.\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- Liquidity is considered limited if it is not possible to trade at least USD30 million in one ticket without significant market impact.\n- The dummies are updated once per month at the end of the month based on the assessment of J.P. Morgan market makers and/or research. Brief spells of illiquidity would not be captured by this series.\nOlder history (prior to launch of JPMaQS) is based on heritage data of Macrosynergy Partners and, before that, replication of real-time liquidity and flexibility status based on an expert review.\n\n\n\n###Equity index future returns\n\n*Ticker:* **EQXR\\_NSA**/**EQXR\\_VT10**\n\n*Label:* Equity index future returns in % of notional / Equity index future return for 10% vol target\n\n*Definition:* Return on front future of main country equity index, % of notional of the contract / Return on front future of main country equity index, % of risk capital on position scaled to 10% (annualized) volatility target\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- The return is simply the % change of the futures price. The return calculation assumes rolling futures (from front to second) on IMM (international monetary markets) days\n- For **EQXR\\_VT10**  positions are scaled to 10% vol target based on the historic standard deviation for an exponential moving average with a half-time of 11 days. Positions are rebalanced at the end of each month",

The criteria for adjustment are statistical and based on pattern recognition\n\n###Inflation target\n\n*Ticker:* **INFTEFF_NSA / INFTARGET\\_NSA**\n\n*Label:* Effective official inflation target (Macrosynergy method), % over a year ago / Estimated extended official target for next year, % over a year ago\n\n*Definition:* Estimated offical inflation target for next year, adjusted for past target deviations. / Estimate of the inflation rate targeted by the government or central bank for the next calendar year, % over a year ago, extended to non-target years.\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- The effective inflation target is the estimated official inflation target plus an adjustment for past \"target misses\". This adjustment is the last 3 years' average gap between actual inflation and the estimated official target mean\n- The formula implies that central banks gradually lose credibility if they miss their targets consistently on either the high or low side for several years. However, the formula does not allow for a sudden loss in credibility, which may arise from a change in policy or policy annoucements\n\n- for **INFTARGET\\_NSA** The calculation of this category is largely similar to \"official inflation target\". However, for periods back to 2000 for which neither a formal nor informal target value was available, pro-forma estimates have been generated based on the average of (i) the past three years' median of CPI core and headline inflation and (ii) the global benchmark for price stability of 2%. This estimate is based on the idea that a generic country targets an inflation between its recent experienced price growth and what is commonly seen as price stability\n- The main purpose of this series is to have a full set of plausible target reference values across all developed and emerging countries back to 2000\n\n###Private credit expansion\n\n*Ticker:* **PCREDITBN\\_SJA\\_P1M1ML12**/**PCREDITGDP\\_SJA\\_D1M1ML12**\n\n*Label:* Private bank credit, jump-adjusted, % over a year ago/ Banks' private credit expansion, jump-adjusted, as % of GDP over 1 year\n\n*Definition:* Private bank credit at the end of the latest reported month, % change over a year ago, seasonal and jump-adjusted/ Change of private credit over 1 year ago, seasonal and jump-adjusted, as % of nominal GDP (1-year moving average) in the base period\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- For most countries the indicator is limited to bank loans to private households and companies\n- The stock of credit is denominated in local currency\n- Jump adjustment means that two types of outliers are adjusted for. First, large \"spikes\" (i.e. two subsequent large moves of the seasonal index in opposite directions) are averaged. The causes for spikes can holiday patterns or tax effects. Second, large one-off jumps in the index are replaced by the local trend. The causes of one-off jumps can be balance sheet restructurings in the banking systems and tax-related asset shifts. The criteria for adjustments are statistical, based on pattern recognition\n- For **PCREDITGDP\\_SJA\\_D1M1ML12** the expansion is calculated as the change in the stock of bank credit over the latest reported 12 months as % of the annual nominal GDP at the beginning of this 12 month period\n\n\n###Longer-term real IRS yields\n\n*Ticker:* **RYLDIRS02Y\\_NSA / RYLDIRS05Y\\_NSA**\n\n*Label:* Real IRS yield: 2-year maturity / 5-year maturity\n\n*Definition:* Main local interest rate swap yield minus inflation expectations: 2-year maturity / 5-year maturity\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- The nominal yield is the yield on a fixed receiver position in the main interest rate swaps contract traded in the currency area. Here inflation expectation is the 2-year or 5-year ahead ahead estimated inflation expectation according to Macrosynergy methodology. See notes on category tickers INFE2Y_JA and INFE5Y_JA on the page \"Inflation expectations (Macrosynergy methodology)\"\n\n##Generic returns\n\n###Duration Returns\n\n*Ticker:* **DU02YXR\\_NSA**/**DU05YXR\\_NSA**\n\n*Label:* Duration return, in % of notional: 2-year maturity / 5-year maturity\n\n*Definition:* Return on fixed receiver position in main interest rate swaps contract traded in the currency area, % of notional of the contract, daily roll: 2-year maturity / 5-year maturity\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- The interest rate derivative for most currency areas is an interest rate swap. For some EM countries (CNY, INR, KRW, THB, TWD) non-deliverable swaps have been used\n- The returns have been approximated as the sums of the yield spread between the fixed and floating leg and the daily change in yield times duration\n\n*Ticker:* **DU02YXR\\_VT10**/**DU05YXR\\_VT10**\n\n*Label:* Duration return for 10% vol target: 2-year maturity / 5-year maturity\n\n*Definition:* Return on fixed receiver position, % of risk capital on position scaled to 10% (annualized) volatility target, assuming monthly roll: 2-year maturity / 5-year maturity\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- Positions are scaled to 10% vol target based on historic standard deviation for an exponential moving average with a half-time of 11 days. Positions are rebalanced at the end of each month and constrained maximum leverage (notional to risk capital) of 20\n- See also related important notes on \"Duration return in % of notional\" (DU02YXR_NSA / DU05YXR_NSA)\n\n###FX forward returns\n\n*Ticker:* **FXXR\\_NSA**/**FXXR\\_VT10**\n\n*Label:*  FX forward return, % of notional: dominant cross / FX forward return for 10% vol target: dominant cross\n\n*Definition:* 1-month FX forward return, % of notional of the contract, assuming roll back to full 1-month maturity at the end of the month: long against natural benchmark currencies / 1-month FX forward return, % of risk capital on position scaled to 10% (annualized) volatility target, assuming roll back to full 1-month maturity at the end of the month: long against natural benchmark currencies\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- The default returns are calculated for a contract that is long the local currency of the cross section against its dominant traded benchmark. For most currencies the benchmark is the dollar. For some European currencies (CHF, CZK, HUF, NOK, PLN, RON, SEK) the benchmark is the euro. And for GBP, TRY, and RUB an equally weighted basked of dollar and euro has been used\n\n- For the following currencies returns are at least based on non-deliverable contracts: BRL, CLP, CNY, IDR, INR, KRW, MYR and TWD. CLP has become deliverable as of 2021\n- For some currencies the returns include periods of low liquidity and FX targeting. If one wishes to 'blacklist' such periods one should use the non-tradability and FX-target dummmies, which have category ticker codes \"FXUNTRADABLE_NSA\" and \"FXTARGETED_NSA\".\n- for **FXXR\\_VT10** Positions are scaled to 10% vol target based on historic standard deviation for an exponential moving average with a half-time of 11 days. Positions are rebalanced at the end of each month.Also, a maximum leverage ratio of 5 (of implied notional to cash position) is imposed\n\n\nReal carry versus dominant cross (no hedges)\n*Ticker:* **FXCRR_NSA**\n\n*Label*: Real forward-implied carry vs. dominant cross: % ar\n\n*Definition:* 1-month FX forward carry against dominant cross(es), % annualized and adjusted for expected inflation differential: based on notional of the contract\n\n*Notes:*\n\nIn contrast to nominal carry, real carry subtracts the differential between the expected local and benchmark inflation rate from annualized carry. The basis for the adjustment is the quantamental indicator \"Estimated 1-year ahead inflation expectation\" (INFE1Y_JA). The basis of these expectations are the dominant headline and core price indices (50-50) according to popular local conventions. \n\n### Exchange rate target dummy\n\n*Ticker*: **FXTARGETED_NSA**\n\n*Label:* Exchange rate target dummy\n\n*Definition:* Binary variable that takes the value 1 (rather than 0) if the exchange rate is targeted through a peg or any regime that significantly reduces exchange rate flexibility.\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- The exchange rate is considered targeted if the authorities have formally or informally set a peg, target corridor, cap or floor that is known in the market and expected to be defended by intervention and that significantly restricts the variation of the exchange rate.\n- The dummies are updated once per month at the end of the month based on the assessment of J.P. Morgan market makers and/or research. For example, if a target has been announced in the middle of the month the variable shifts from 0 to 1 at the end of this month.\n- Older history (prior to launch of JPMaQS)is based on heritage data of Macrosynergy Partners and, before that, replication of real-time liquidity and flexibility status based on an expert review.\nFX untradability dummy\n\n\n*Ticker*: **FXUNTRADABLE_NSA**\n\n*Label:* FX untradability dummy\n\n*Definition:* Binary variable that takes the value 1 (rather than 0) if either (i) liquidity in the main FX forward market is limited or (ii) convertibility restrictions significantly distort the link between tradable offshore and untradable onshore contracts.\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- Liquidity is considered limited if it is not possible to trade at least USD30 million in one ticket without significant market impact.\n- The dummies are updated once per month at the end of the month based on the assessment of J.P. Morgan market makers and/or research. Brief spells of illiquidity would not be captured by this series.\nOlder history (prior to launch of JPMaQS) is based on heritage data of Macrosynergy Partners and, before that, replication of real-time liquidity and flexibility status based on an expert review.\n\n\n\n###Equity index future returns\n\n*Ticker:* **EQXR\\_NSA**/**EQXR\\_VT10**\n\n*Label:* Equity index future returns in % of notional / Equity index future return for 10% vol target\n\n*Definition:* Return on front future of main country equity index, % of notional of the contract / Return on front future of main country equity index, % of risk capital on position scaled to 10% (annualized) volatility target\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- The return is simply the % change of the futures price. The return calculation assumes rolling futures (from front to second) on IMM (international monetary markets) days\n- For **EQXR\\_VT10**  positions are scaled to 10% vol target based on the historic standard deviation for an exponential moving average with a half-time of 11 days.
