The whole dataset is divided into 23 clusters and each cluster is presented by a representative species, which is based on the synapomorphies characteristic from the extent that the taxon is monophyletic. The representative image indicates the distinction between clusters shown in the figure below, e.g. the presence or absence of components (anal-fin, nasal, infraorbitals), specific number (six dorsal-fin spines, two spiny dorsal-fins), particular shape (second dorsal-fin spine long), etc. This figure shows the representative fish species name and the numbers of detections. The data is very imbalanced where the most frequent species is about 1000 times more than the least one. The fish detection and tracking software described in [1] is used to obtain the fish images. The fish species are manually labeled by following instructions from marine biologists [2].\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F5980358%2F5cc6093c54b3dc535bed661e93fc7a12%2Fgt_labels.png?generation=1700950637892694&alt=media)\n\n[Original page](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/fish4knowledge/GROUNDTRUTH/RECOG/) created by Phoenix X.
