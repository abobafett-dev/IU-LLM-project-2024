To achieve a squared shape during resizing, certain images have been augmented with an additional white frame around them (outpainted).\n\n**Please Note:**\nAll the images in the dataset were obtained from various sources, including Istock, Adobe Stock, and Instagram. Consequently, a few images may contain watermarks. \nAdditionally, a small fraction of the dataset might contain mislabeled images or duplicates.\n\n**The dataset is divided into 9 shards. Data between shards is NOT equally distributed, some shards may not include all the breeds from the dataset.**",
