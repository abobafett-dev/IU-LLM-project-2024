Gresenz, J. White, D. Schmidt, \"Attention Regions in Terrain Roughness Classification for Off-Road Autonomous Vehicles\", 2021.\n```\n\n## Content\n\nThere are two core components of this dataset, as mentioned above:\n1. Path Segmentation (PS) dataset: 500+ images of off-road terrain and pixel-wise masks for path segmentation learning.\n2. Attention Region (AR) dataset: 5000+ images with two variations of attention regions around the upcoming drivable terrain, applied using a semantic segmentation network.\n\nThe PS dataset is located in the `TrainingImages` folder. It contains two subdirectories: `OriginalImages` and `EnumMasks`. `EnumMasks` contains two versions of masks for each image in `OriginalImages`, one where pixel values are either 0 or 255, and one where pixel values are either 0 or 1. Image masks have the same name as the corresponding image with an additional `_P` at the end of the image name. For example, for image `ImageName.png`, its masks are named `ImageName_P.png`.\n\nThe AR dataset is located in the `AttentionRegion` folder. It contains two subdirectories: `dark` and `light`. The images in these folders are images of off-road terrain where the non-path pixels have either been colored black (in the `dark` folder) or white (in the `light`) folder. These images were labeled using a semantic segmentation network trained with the images and masks in the PS dataset. The semantic segmentation network was applied to a set of over 7,000 images (located in our dataset from Gresenz et al. [2]). This dataset includes all images which were either a) almost perfectly segmented, or b) had a few extra non-path pixels included in the attention region, resulting in a total of 5000+ images in each of the `AttentionRegion` subfolders.\n\n## Links\nCheck out our other dataset, [Off-Road Terrain Dataset for Autonomous Vehicles](https://www.kaggle.com/magnumresearchgroup/offroad-terrain-dataset-for-autonomous-vehicles). This dataset contains roughness labels for each of the images in the AR dataset.\n\nThe Github repo for the papers associated with these datasets is located [here](https://github.com/magnumresearchgroup/TerrainRoughnessPrediction).\n\n## References\n[1] G.
