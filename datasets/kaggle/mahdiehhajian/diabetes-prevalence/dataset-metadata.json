  "descriptionNullable": "The word diabetes is used in medicine for a set of diseases that have a common feature in the patient's polyuria.\n\nDiabetes mellitus [11] or sugar disease (in English: Diabetes mellitus) [F1] is a type of metabolic and chronic disease whose symptom is blood sugar higher than 120 (mg/dL) in a long time. This disease has three main types: type 1, type 2 and pregnancy; In type 1 diabetes, due to the destruction of pancreatic beta cells, the ability to produce insulin hormone in the body is lost. This type of diabetes can be caused by an autoimmune disease, and due to the lack of insulin in the body of the affected person, there is a definite need for insulin injection. Diabetes is also known as \"insulin dependent diabetes\" or \"juvenile diabetes\". In type 2 diabetes, the cells of the body do not respond correctly to the presence of insulin, and the produced insulin cannot perform its normal function and reduce the sugar in the blood. This may eventually lead to the destruction of pancreatic beta cells and the complete cessation of insulin production. Genetic factors, obesity and inactivity play an important role in a person's type 2 diabetes. The third type is called female diabetes or gestational diabetes; This disease occurs when pregnant women without a history of diabetes develop high blood sugar levels.\n\nThe hormone insulin and glucagon are blood sugar regulators, the role of glucagon is to raise blood sugar and the role of insulin is to lower blood sugar by different mechanisms.\n\nIn diabetes, the speed and ability of the body to fully use and metabolize glucose decreases, hence the blood sugar level is increased, which is called hyperglycemia. When this increase in sugar is present in the body for a long time, it causes the destruction of very small vessels in the body, which can affect different organs of the body such as kidneys, eyes and nerves. Also, diabetes is directly related to the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases; Therefore, screening and early diagnosis of this disease in people with underlying diseases can be effective in preventing these complications. Diagnosing and screening for diabetes is possible by performing a blood sugar test.\n\nAccording to global health statistics, the prevalence of diabetes in adults in the world is 8.8%, of which about 90% is type 2 diabetes; Also, its gender prevalence rate is the same in men and women.\n\nTrend Table - Health US 2011. Diabetes prevalence & glycemic control among adults of 20 yrs & over, 1988\u201394 and 2003\u201306\nSUMMARY\nHealth, United States is an annual report on trends in health statistics, find more information at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus.htm.",
