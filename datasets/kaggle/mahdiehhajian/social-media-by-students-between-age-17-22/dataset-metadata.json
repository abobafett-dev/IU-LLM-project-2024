Although he may not be very comfortable with them and cannot share his personal issues with them and spend part of his daily time with them, they are considered his friends. Social media can help you make friends with people from all over the world and expand your reach.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3.

Increased threat\nOne of the negative effects of social media is threats. Along with some of its beneficial effects, social media increases negative consequences. This is because too many people consider social media as a place to share their personal information. This is a good opportunity to increase the threat. As a result, you should be careful about what you upload or download.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Increased comparison\nOne of the negative effects of social networks is related to comparing young people with each other. The digital personalities of people who exist in social networks are significantly different from their real personalities and identities.
