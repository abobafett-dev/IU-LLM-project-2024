So i created this dataset and actually make sure that each image is different. This dataset is purposefully created in such a way that little bit of preprocessing is used.Generated using google's teachable machine. Where we can create the image dataset and also train and test a model with the personally created dataset. The coolest thing is completely online and.. and... you can download the dataset, the model so that you can run it on your machine.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset you look is not actually raw data and at the same time not a properly structured one. It has 4 classification of images without labels and images in the classification dont follow a unique id. \n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nA huge thanks to the google's [teachable machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) . Newbie can utilize this tool to create their own datasets in minutes.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nInspired from the current and aspiring data scientists to do something for the community.
