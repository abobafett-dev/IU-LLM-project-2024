Chronic conditions (disease) 2. Tests and Vaccines 3. Member experience with healthcare plans. All variables starting with C01 to C32 are related to part C of the surveys. Similarly Part D of the survey is related to Drugs plans customer services. In data variables starting with D01 to D15 is related to part D. Surveys such as HOS CAHPS etc contains questions whose final standing results into C01 to C32, and D01 to D15 measures.

Files related to star rating have two types of measures which are used to determine star rating of the healthcare plans - Part C and Part D. Part C is has three type of information 1. Chronic conditions (disease) 2. Tests and Vaccines 3. Member experience with healthcare plans. All variables starting with C01 to C32 are related to part C of the surveys. Similarly Part D of the survey is related to Drugs plans customer services. In data variables starting with D01 to D15 is related to part D. Surveys such as HOS CAHPS etc contains questions whose final standing results into C01 to C32, and D01 to D15 measures.
