The dataset includes key attributes such as age, city, and total sales of the customers. By leveraging K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, I aim to group customers based on their age and sales metrics. These insights will enable the creation of targeted marketing campaigns tailored to the specific needs and behaviours of each customer segment.\n\n**Objectives**\n- Cluster Customers: Use K-Means clustering to group customers based on age and total sales.\n- Analyse Segments: Examine the characteristics of each customer segment.\n- Targeted Marketing: Develop strategies for personalized marketing campaigns targeting each identified customer group.\n\n**Data Description**\nThe dataset comprises:\n\n- Age: The age of the customers.\n- City: The city where the customers reside.\n- Total Sales: The total sales generated by each customer.\n\n**Methodology**\n- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle any missing or inconsistent entries.\n- Feature Selection: Focus on age and total sales as primary features for clustering.\n- K-Means Clustering: Apply the K-Means algorithm to identify distinct customer segments.\n- Cluster Analysis: Analyse the resulting clusters to understand the demographic and sales characteristics of each group.\n- Marketing Strategy Development: Create targeted marketing strategies for each customer segment to enhance engagement and sales.\n\n**Expected Outcomes**\n- Customer Segments: Clear identification of customer groups based on age and purchasing behaviour.\n- Insights for Marketing: Detailed understanding of each segment to inform targeted marketing efforts.\n- Business Impact: Enhanced ability to tailor marketing campaigns, potentially leading to increased customer satisfaction and sales.\n\nBy clustering customers based on age and total sales, this project aims to provide actionable insights for personalized marketing, ultimately driving better customer engagement and higher sales for the retail store.\n\n",
