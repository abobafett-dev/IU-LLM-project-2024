The data set provides structured data in the XML format and requires its users to extract various entities.  \n\n### Content\n\nThe data set consist of XML files and images. The XML files contain the extracted data from the image of the invoices, name of text and XML file is kept the same for clarity. Users of the dataset should extract entities like invoice no, invoice data, company name (invoice from company1 to company2/person), telephone number of the company, address e.t.c \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe wouldn't be here without the help of others. If you owe any attributions or thanks, include them here along with any citations of past research.\n\n\n### Inspiration\nChallenges:\nInvoices data contains tabular data, which is challenging to deal with. Design a methodology to extract information from tabular data. \nDue to obvious reasons, certain numbers in XML are erroneous for eg, '0' replaced by 'O'.  ",
