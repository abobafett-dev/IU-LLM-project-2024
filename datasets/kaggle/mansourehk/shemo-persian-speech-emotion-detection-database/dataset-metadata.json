We also present benchmark results based on common classification methods in speech emotion detection task. \n- According to the experiments, support vector machine achieves the best results for both gender-independent  (58.2%) and gender-dependent models (female = 59.4%, male = 57.6%).\n- The official website: [ShemoDB](http://shemodb.com/)\n- Github: [ShEMO](https://github.com/mansourehk/ShEMO)\n- If you use this dataset, please cite the following paper:\n&gt; @Article{MohamadNezami2019,\nauthor=\"Mohamad Nezami, Omid\nand Jamshid Lou, Paria\nand Karami, Mansoureh\",\ntitle=\"ShEMO: a large-scale validated database for Persian speech emotion detection\",\njournal=\"Language Resources and Evaluation\",\nyear=\"2019\",\nmonth=\"Mar\",\nday=\"01\",\nvolume=\"53\",\nnumber=\"1\",\npages=\"1--16\",\nissn=\"1574-0218\",\ndoi=\"10.1007/s10579-018-9427-x\",\nurl=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10579-018-9427-x\"\n}\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\n- You can extract proper features from the audios and use them for classification purposes.\n- You can use the audios as raw inputs for a deep learning system.\n\n### Description of Labels\nThe characters used in the labels and their corresponding meaning:\n\nM = male speaker\nF = female speaker\nS = sadness\nA = anger\nH = happiness\nW = surprise\nF = fear\nN = neutral\ne.g., F03S02 means the speaker is female (F), speaker code is 03, the underlying emotion of the utterance is sadness (S), and this is the second utterance for this speaker in sad emotion.",
