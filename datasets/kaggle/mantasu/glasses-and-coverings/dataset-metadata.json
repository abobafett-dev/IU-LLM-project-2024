All the images were aligned and center-cropped to `256\u00d7256`.\n\n&gt; **Note**: the dataset may contain duplicates, imperfect alignment, or outlier images, not representative of the indicated category. There may also be mixed images, e.g., a picture of a person wearing spectacles and a mask.\n\n## Structure\n\nThere are a total of 5 directories:\n* `plain` [497] - images of regular people's faces\n* `glasses` [528] - images of people wearing spectacles\n* `sunglasses` [488] - images of people wearing sunglasses\n* `sunglasses-imagenet` [580] - additional images of people wearing sunglasses\n* `covering` [444] - images of people with covered faces (covered by hair, masks, hoodies, hands, face paint, etc.)\n\n## Collection\n\nAll the images were collected from [Google Images](https://images.google.com/) using [google-images-download](https://pypi.org/project/google_images_download/) with the usage rights flag `labeled-for-noncommercial-reuse-with-modification`. The exception is the `sunglasses-imagenet` folder which contains pictures from [image-net](https://www.image-net.org/), specifically downloaded from [images.cv](https://images.cv/dataset/sunglasses-image-classification-dataset).\n\nAll the images were aligned with [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) and center-cropped to `256\u00d7256` with reflective padding. It is harder to align pictures with various face coverings, therefore, there are fewer images in that category.\n\n## License\n\nThis dataset is marked under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), meaning you can share and modify the data for non-commercial reuse as long as you provide a copyright notice.
