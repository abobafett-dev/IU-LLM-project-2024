It contains real-world imagery of different anomalies found in solar farms. I acquired more data in an attempt to increase it, something that the original dataset presentation article expects from the community.\n\nThis dataset was originally published at [ICLR 2020 in AI for Earth Sciences workshop](https://ai4earthscience.github.io/iclr-2020-workshop/papers/ai4earth22.pdf).\n\n---\n\n# 1. Context\nPhotovoltaic parks of all sizes are subject to failure, especially in relation to solar panels in view of the stress operating conditions they are exposed to. The use of thermography, mainly through drones equipped with infrared cameras, is an effective preventive maintenance method in detecting abnormalities in the modules, being as minimally intervening as possible during the process of generating energy in the photovoltaic system.\n\nTo understand more about this problem, read these resources:\n- [ Review of failures of PV modules](https://iea-pvps.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IEA-PVPS_T13-01_2014_Review_of_Failures_of_Photovoltaic_Modules_Final.pdf);\n- [Review of IR and EL images applications for PV systems](https://iea-pvps.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Review_on_IR_and_EL_Imaging_for_PV_Field_Applications_by_Task_13.pdf);\n- [Raptor maps's knoledge hub](https://raptormaps.com/solar-tech-docs/).\n\n# 2.
