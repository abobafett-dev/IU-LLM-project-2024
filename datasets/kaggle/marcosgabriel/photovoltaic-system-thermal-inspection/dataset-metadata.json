  "descriptionNullable": "[SenseFly](https://ageagle.com/) carried out a thermographic inspection of a photovoltaic system and had made this dataset available to the public, but with the change of their website, they took it offline. So, as I had previously downloaded it for academic purposes, I decided to make it available here. The license can be found [here](https://ageagle.com/terms-and-conditions/).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Context\n\nBoth large and small photovoltaic systems are susceptible to failures in their equipment, especially in modules due to operational stresses that are exposed and errors during the installation process of these devices. Although numerous internal and external factors originate these failures, the common phenomenon presented by several of them is hot spots on module defective area. The immediate impact is perceptible in the reduction of the generated power and, in the long term, in the reduction of the useful life of the equipment due to the high temperatures presented. The preventive maintenance method for recognizing this phenomenon is the use of thermography images in inspections of photovoltaic modules. Through this procedure, faulty modules are immediately identified with failures at an early stage due to their high heat signatures compared to the others, captured by cameras with infrared sensors. Currently, the use of this type of camera attached to drones stands out for providing an increase in the inspection area and a reduction in its execution time.\n\nFor this purpose, SenseFly teamed up with [Romande Energie](https://www.romande-energie.ch/), a&nbsp;forward-thinking Swiss organization, to inspect a solar farm managed by them that needed a full thermal inspection with a drone. It was found that it's modules were dirty due to dust from the terrace and 19 PV modules had hot spots, even though they are working. The hot spots are from different failure sources, like by dust shading, internal malfunction or a broken part of the panel.\n\n### 1.1 Photovoltaic system specifications\n\nAcording to the dataset [online article](https://ageagle.com/blog/conducting-a-solar-panel-inspection-with-an-ebee-drone/), the photovoltaic system on which the thermographic inspection was carried out is located in Switzerland, more specifically on the roof of a large building owned by the Swiss supermarket chain, [Migros Vaud](https://vaud.migros.ch/fr.html). It has a capacity of 1 MW, corresponding to 4000 PV modules installed.\n\n![solar site](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F5048762%2F06d1be0e7f1f7e297b0f5153da0feb0b%2Fsolar_farm.png?generation=1671322410437065&alt=media)\n\n### 1.2 Thermal inspection specifications\n\nThe inspection drone used is a SenseFly eBee [Classic](https://www.wevolver.com/specs/ebee.classic) (discontinued), a fixed-wing drone that can cover up to 12 km\u00b2 (4.6 mi\u00b2) in a single automated flight, while flights over smaller areas, flown at lower altitudes, can acquire images with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of down to 1.5 cm (0.6 in) per pixel. Attached to it was a SenseFly [ThermoMAP](http://www.pegesul.com.br/produtos/catalogos/vant/SenseFly-eBee-S.O.D.A-PT.pdf) (discontinued), a thermography camera with the following specifications:\n\n* Image resolution of 640 x 512 pixels;\n* Ground resolution of 14 cm (5.5 in) /px on 75 m (246 ft);\n* Temperature range of -40\u00baC to 160\u00baC (-40 \u00b0F a 320 \u00b0F);\n* Temperature resolution of 0.1 \u00b0C (0.2 \u00b0F);\n* Operation altitude of 75 to 150 m (246 to 492 ft.);\n* Output images in Tiff format and video in MP4 format.\n\nThe inspection was carried out on a sunny day in, approximately, 5 minutes and before cleaning the modules. The drone cover a area of 0.08 sq. km (0.03 sq mi) of the PV system and was maintained at an altitude of 70 meters (229.6 ft), obtaining a terrain resolution of 14.23 cm (5.6 in)/px.\n\nIn the image bellow is the flight plan taken.\n\n![drone flight plan](https://ageagle.com/wp-content/uploads/sensefly/app/2016/02/drone-solar-panel-2.png)\n\n## 2.
