The authors of the first dataset shared it with 120 images as a supplemental material along with some Matlab codes. The author of the second dataset shared his data on Github due to a personal project he carried out. As the original datasets only had thermal (IR) images, I've annotate each one of them, enabling the use of instance/semantic segmentation to detect PV modules/arrays and classify it's condition (defected or not).\n\n---\n\n# 1. Context\n\nBoth large and small photovoltaic systems are susceptible to failures in their equipment, especially in modules due to operational stresses that are exposed and errors during the installation process of these devices. Although numerous internal and external factors originate these failures, the common phenomenon presented by several of them is hot spots on module defective area. The immediate impact is perceptible in the reduction of the generated power and, in the long term, in the reduction of the useful life of the equipment due to the high temperatures presented. The preventive maintenance method for recognizing this phenomenon is the use of thermography images in inspections of photovoltaic modules. Through this procedure, faulty modules are immediately identified with failures at an early stage due to their high heat signatures compared to the others, captured by cameras with infrared sensors. Currently, the use of this type of camera attached to drones stands out for providing an increase in the inspection area and a reduction in its execution time.\n\nTo understand more about this, read these reports by International energy agency (IEA):\n- [ Review of failures of PV modules](https://iea-pvps.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IEA-PVPS_T13-01_2014_Review_of_Failures_of_Photovoltaic_Modules_Final.pdf);\n- [Review of IR and EL images applications for PV systems](https://iea-pvps.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Review_on_IR_and_EL_Imaging_for_PV_Field_Applications_by_Task_13.pdf).\n\n## 1.1 Thermal Images\n\nIn thermography area, FLIR is the company that stands out the most, with it's equipments being the most used. It's influence in this field has ensured that his proprietary image formats are the most studied, through the use of reverse engineering (such as those published by the [Exiftool](https://exiftool.org/TagNames/FLIR.html) website and some [electronics forums](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/thermal-imaging/flir-e4-thermal-imaging-camera-teardown/msg342072/#msg342072)). Most of your cameras currently produce images in R-JPG (radiometric JPG) format, where radiometric data is embedded in their metadata. If there is a common digital camera attached to the thermal camera, its image will also be stored in this metadata.\n\n## 1.2 Image annotation\n\nFor image annotation, I used the [Flyr](https://bitbucket.org/nimmerwoner/flyr/src/master/) Python library to extract the radiometric data from each image metadata (in R-JPG format) and convert it into an 8-bit image. This is important as the actual thermal image (embedded in the metadata of the image pulled from the camera) is always smaller than the original one (image pulled from the camera). Also, the original image always has some object that obstructs a relevant part of the scene, like the FLIR logo.\n\n\u2003\n\nAfter this, I used [Grid annotation tool 2](https://github.com/LukasBommes/Grid-Anotation-Tool-2) to demarcate the photovoltaic modules. This tool was created by [Lukas Bommes](https://github.com/LukasBommes) to precisely help annotate objects very close to each other, in a grid structure  as showed by the image bellow. \n\n<br>\n\n![grid-annotation-tool-example](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F5048762%2F60d6fb64038475ca48cd7df5c475ac70%2Fgrid-annotation-tool-example.png?generation=1670540579132887&alt=media)\n\n<br>\n\nThe annotation is in JSON format and if you look into this tool repository, you'll notice that I've changed some keys. I removed the \"image\" key, changed \"grid cells\" to \"instances\", removed \"id\" and \"truncated\" to \"defected modules\" in order to highlight which modules are defective. Therefore, each annotation has the bellow structure:\n\n<br>\n\n```\n{\n  \"instances\": [\n    {\n      \"corners\": [\n        {\"x\": 181.98136043148975, \"y\": 180.87500292991302},\n        {\"x\": 80.99062551749896, \"y\": 176.94569670353974},\n        {\"x\": 78.42819076221744, \"y\": 294.24826550087346},\n        {\"x\": 183.0432587489509, \"y\": 294.49812289825013}\n      ],\n      \"center\": {\"x\": 131.1108588650393, \"y\": 236.64177200814407},\n      \"defected_modules\": true\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n<br>\n\nEach annotation file has a \"instances\" key that contains a list of dictionaries (representing PV modules) with the following keys: four \"corner points\", one \"center point\", it's own \"id\" and \"defected_modules\" (a boolean flag indicating whether the modules is defected).\n\n## 1.3 Defected PV modules\n\nNeither the paper of the first dataset or the github repo of the second dataset does not specify any defect type of each faulty module. So, I analyzed the images based on the [Raptor maps's knoledge hub](https://raptormaps.com/solar-tech-docs/) and the [IEC TS 62446-3](https://ayscomdatatec.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Normativa-IEC-TS-62446-3.pdf) documentation. In the following tables,  I summarized the defects that I've identified in the  datasets.\n\n| Defect | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diode | A activated bypass diode provides a current path around a faulty cell or module, affecting typically 1/3 of the module. |\n| Cell | Hot spot occurs with square geometry in a single cell. |\n| Cell-Multi | Hot spots occurring with square geometry in multiple cells. |\n| Junction Box | Hot spot at the junction-box (an enclosure on the module that connects the PV strings) location on the module. |\n| Module | The entire module is heated or offline. |\n\n<br>\n\n### 1.3.1 First dataset\n\n| Class | Image |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diode | 2.jpg |\n| Cell | 31.jpg, 32.jpg, 33.jpg, 58.jpg, 59.jpg, 103.jpg, 104.jpg |\n| Cell Multi | 28.jpg, 29.jpg, 30.jpg, 39.jpg, 40.jpg, 41.jpg, 42.jpg, 43.jpg, 66.jpg, 83.jpg, 84.jpg, 85.jpg |\n| Junction box | 47.jpg, 48.jpg, 49.jpg, 50.jpg, 51.jpg |\n\n### 1.3.2 Second dataset\n\n| Class | Image |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cell | 20180630_154201.jpg, 20180630_154239.jpg, 20180630_154245.jpg, 20180630_154305.jpg, 20180630_154327.jpg, 20180630_154451.jpg, 20180630_154509.jpg, 20180630_154513.jpg, 20180630_154519.jpg, 20180630_154523.jpg, 20180630_154541.jpg, 20180630_154549.jpg, 20180630_154609.jpg, 20180630_154617.jpg |\n| Cell Multi | 20180630_154039.jpg, 20180630_154139.jpg, 20180630_154509.jpg, 20180630_154531.jpg, 20180630_154541.jpg, 20180630_154549.jpg, 20180630_154609.jpg, 20180630_154617.jpg |\n| Junction box | 20180630_154039.jpg, 20180630_154139.jpg, 20180630_154201.jpg, 20180630_154239.jpg, 20180630_154305.jpg, 20180630_154327.jpg, 20180630_154549.jpg, 20180630_154609.jpg |\n| Module |20180630_154327.jpg |\n\n## 1.4 Photovoltaic system specifications\n\n### 1.4.1 First dataset\n\nAcording to the dataset article of the first dataset, the thermographic inspection was carried out on a photovoltaic system located in northern Italy. It has a total peak power of approximately 6 MWp and an azimuth angle of 180\u00ba (facing Earth's South). It's modules measure 1650 x 992 mm, have polycrystalline silicon cells and were installed on flat ground with an inclination angle of 20\u00ba.\n\n\u2003\n\nThe images in this dataset refer to the region marked in red in the google maps screenshot of the location of the photovoltaic system. Counting the modules, there is 3840 in total and 960 in the red region.\n\n<br>\n\n![dataset-1-birds-eye-view](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F5048762%2Fb09c116535c69102bf116ed25ff753ea%2Fpv-system.png?generation=1670556475784965&alt=media)\n\n### 1.4.2 Second dataset\n\nThe author of the second dataset don't shared much about the thermographic inspection or the photovoltaic system. But, looking to the images, the modules look like made by polycrystalline silicon cells.\n\n<br>\n\n![dataset-2-birds-eye-view](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F5048762%2F448d66a8a8fc5755475282da18b92589%2FScreenshot_20221209_222853.png?generation=1686958660895730&alt=media)\n\n## 1.5 Thermal inspection specifications\n\nThe drone used in the inspection was a DJI  model MATRICE 210 RTK coupled with a [FLIR XT2](https://dl.djicdn.com/downloads/Zenmuse%20XT%202/Zenmuse%20XT%202%20User%20Manual%20v1.0_.pdf) thermal camera that has the following specifications: measured temperature in the range of from -25\u00baC to 35\u00baC; resolution of 640x512 pixels; 19 mm lens, 32\u00ba(H) x 26\u00ba(V); thermal sensitivity less than 0.05\u00baC.\n\nDuring the inspection, the drone was positioned approximately 20 meters from the ground, remaining orthogonal to the floor and with an observation angle in relation to the glass surface of modules of less than 30\u00ba. They used a gimbal device to keep the image stable during the flight. The company responsible for this thermography inspection was [PVK S.r.l](https://pvk-srl.it/en/home-english/).\n\n# 2. Inspiration\n\nThe core objective is help a maintenance team in order to intervene and replace panels if necessary,  guiding them. So, one idea that comes to mind is the creation of a web app that displays the detected faulty modules, like the first image bellow. One can detects PV modules with a instance segmentation model, track them with a object tracker and classify their integrity (binary or multiclass classification) with a image classification model.\n\n<br>\n\n![first-example-solution](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F5048762%2F52666029cd871e6597dc0b99d3898103%2Fimage-30-7.png?generation=1670525723873379&alt=media)\n\n<br>\n\nSomething more advanced would be to integrate the detection with an bird's eye view of the photovoltaic system. A service often provided by companies in this area, like the image bellow.\n\n<br>\n\n![second-example-solution](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F5048762%2F41a7e136dcf51f6ac51c03e455080a50%2Faccessing-inspection-analytics-6-e1655994501681.png?generation=1670525560898328&alt=media)\n\n<br>\n\n# 3. Resources\n\nThere's a online article by [Drone Life]( https://thedronelifenj.com/drone-solar-inspection-software/) that summarize the best softwares for drone PV solar inspections. But, companies like: [Raptor maps](https://raptormaps.com/pv-solar-asset-solutions/), [Above Surveying](https://www.abovesurveying.com/inspection/aerial-thermographic-solar-inspection/), [Sitemark](https://www.sitemark.com/solutions/solar-operation/), [Nanonets](https://nanonets.com/drone/solar-panels/), [Rentadrone](https://rentadrone.cl/industrial/servicio-termografia-drones/), \n[Skyline](https://skylinedrones.ro/photovoltaic-inspections-with-drones/) offer this kind of service, providing resources that explain their solutions. \n\nIn addition, I selected some academic works that, in my opinion, are the best in the area.\n\n- [**ANALYST PV**](https://michiel-vlaminck.github.io/projects/analyst-pv/): A project with goals to provide tools for fault localization, power loss quantification and improved diagnostics of PV power plants. If you want to  have a deep understanding about this solution, read these 3 papers [GPS-assisted feature  matching in  real aerial images with highly repetitive patterns](https://www.comp4drones.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Feature_Matching_in_Aerial_Images_final.pdf), [Solar Panel Detection within Complex Backgrounds Using Thermal Images Acquired by UAVs ](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/21/6219),  [Region-Based CNN for Anomaly Detection in PV Power Plants Using Aerial Imagery](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/3/1244#B14-sensors-22-01244);\n\n- [**PV-HAWK**](https://lukasbommes.github.io/PV-Hawk/): A computer vision pipeline for the automated inspection of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) plants by means of thermal infrared (IR) or visual RGB videos acquired by a drone.

Counting the modules, there is 3840 in total and 960 in the red region.\n\n<br>\n\n![dataset-1-birds-eye-view](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F5048762%2Fb09c116535c69102bf116ed25ff753ea%2Fpv-system.png?generation=1670556475784965&alt=media)\n\n### 1.4.2 Second dataset\n\nThe author of the second dataset don't shared much about the thermographic inspection or the photovoltaic system. But, looking to the images, the modules look like made by polycrystalline silicon cells.\n\n<br>\n\n![dataset-2-birds-eye-view](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F5048762%2F448d66a8a8fc5755475282da18b92589%2FScreenshot_20221209_222853.png?generation=1686958660895730&alt=media)\n\n## 1.5 Thermal inspection specifications\n\nThe drone used in the inspection was a DJI  model MATRICE 210 RTK coupled with a [FLIR XT2](https://dl.djicdn.com/downloads/Zenmuse%20XT%202/Zenmuse%20XT%202%20User%20Manual%20v1.0_.pdf) thermal camera that has the following specifications: measured temperature in the range of from -25\u00baC to 35\u00baC; resolution of 640x512 pixels; 19 mm lens, 32\u00ba(H) x 26\u00ba(V); thermal sensitivity less than 0.05\u00baC.\n\nDuring the inspection, the drone was positioned approximately 20 meters from the ground, remaining orthogonal to the floor and with an observation angle in relation to the glass surface of modules of less than 30\u00ba. They used a gimbal device to keep the image stable during the flight. The company responsible for this thermography inspection was [PVK S.r.l](https://pvk-srl.it/en/home-english/).\n\n# 2. Inspiration\n\nThe core objective is help a maintenance team in order to intervene and replace panels if necessary,  guiding them. So, one idea that comes to mind is the creation of a web app that displays the detected faulty modules, like the first image bellow. One can detects PV modules with a instance segmentation model, track them with a object tracker and classify their integrity (binary or multiclass classification) with a image classification model.\n\n<br>\n\n![first-example-solution](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F5048762%2F52666029cd871e6597dc0b99d3898103%2Fimage-30-7.png?generation=1670525723873379&alt=media)\n\n<br>\n\nSomething more advanced would be to integrate the detection with an bird's eye view of the photovoltaic system. A service often provided by companies in this area, like the image bellow.\n\n<br>\n\n![second-example-solution](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F5048762%2F41a7e136dcf51f6ac51c03e455080a50%2Faccessing-inspection-analytics-6-e1655994501681.png?generation=1670525560898328&alt=media)\n\n<br>\n\n# 3. Resources\n\nThere's a online article by [Drone Life]( https://thedronelifenj.com/drone-solar-inspection-software/) that summarize the best softwares for drone PV solar inspections. But, companies like: [Raptor maps](https://raptormaps.com/pv-solar-asset-solutions/), [Above Surveying](https://www.abovesurveying.com/inspection/aerial-thermographic-solar-inspection/), [Sitemark](https://www.sitemark.com/solutions/solar-operation/), [Nanonets](https://nanonets.com/drone/solar-panels/), [Rentadrone](https://rentadrone.cl/industrial/servicio-termografia-drones/), \n[Skyline](https://skylinedrones.ro/photovoltaic-inspections-with-drones/) offer this kind of service, providing resources that explain their solutions. \n\nIn addition, I selected some academic works that, in my opinion, are the best in the area.\n\n- [**ANALYST PV**](https://michiel-vlaminck.github.io/projects/analyst-pv/): A project with goals to provide tools for fault localization, power loss quantification and improved diagnostics of PV power plants. If you want to  have a deep understanding about this solution, read these 3 papers [GPS-assisted feature  matching in  real aerial images with highly repetitive patterns](https://www.comp4drones.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Feature_Matching_in_Aerial_Images_final.pdf), [Solar Panel Detection within Complex Backgrounds Using Thermal Images Acquired by UAVs ](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/21/6219),  [Region-Based CNN for Anomaly Detection in PV Power Plants Using Aerial Imagery](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/3/1244#B14-sensors-22-01244);\n\n- [**PV-HAWK**](https://lukasbommes.github.io/PV-Hawk/): A computer vision pipeline for the automated inspection of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) plants by means of thermal infrared (IR) or visual RGB videos acquired by a drone. To fully understand this solution, you have to read these 3 papers: [Computer vision tool for detection, mapping, and fault classification of photovoltaics modules in aerial IR videos](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pip.3448), [Georeferencing of photovoltaic modules from aerial infrared videos using structure-from-motion](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pip.3564), [Anomaly detection in IR images of PV modules using supervised contrastive learning](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pip.3518).\n\nBesides all of this, I've learned a lot by reading the following reports:\n\n- This  guides by [FLIR](http://support.flir.com/appstories/AppStories/Electrical&Mechanical/Testing_solar_panels_EN.pdf) and [TESTO](https://www.murcal.com/pdf%20folder/15.testo_thermography_guide.pdf) companies are good resources to understand more about thermography in the solar modules context;\n\n- There's [another one by FLIR](https://thermalcapture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pv-system-inspection-thermal-drones-07-15-19.pdf) that explains in depth how aerial thermal inspections of photovoltaic systems are made and their importance in this field;\n\n- To understand the level of influence that the module degradation has on the yield of the photovoltaic system you can read the [IEC TS-62446-3]( https://ayscomdatatec.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Normativa-IEC-TS-62446-3.pdf) and the [Raptor maps's knoledge hub](https://raptormaps.com/solar-tech-docs/);\n\n- [This blog post by above surveying](https://www.abovesurveying.com/an-introduction-to-aerial-thermographic-inspection/) have a good explanation about this topic.",
