The business question being stated was, \"What characteristics of an anime can we use to ensure an anime's success for an American audience?\" As this was for a business, I decided to exclude all \"Ecchi\" series as I had decided the company I was working for was wanting to steer clear of that genre.\n\nThe data came from two sources for three separate charts. The data came from Myanimelist, an anime rating database with a high American ratio. IMDb, a more general database of movies and shows that includes anime but with less of a focus on it. MAL_V5 is the hand typed data set as there wasn't a good means of gathering the data automatically with the tools I had. It includes the top 250 anime rated on the website as of early March. As it was hand typed and a database, some of the anime moved ranks as I was finishing up typing, but many have stayed or only adjusted slightly when I finished. IMDb is also a database, but I was able to select the top 500 shows and movies overall for one sheet and 500 anime (the first ones that popped up that I recognized as anime) for another sheet. These were individually chosen but acquired auto-generated data from IMDb for them.\n\n**Acknowledgement:**\n\nImage from Vivy Fluorite Eye's Song\n\nMyanimelist: https://myanimelist.net/\n\nIMDb: https://www.imdb.com/\n\n**Inspiration: **\n\n- What characteristics are the most impactful?\n\n- How good does an anime need to be to have a good viewership.",
