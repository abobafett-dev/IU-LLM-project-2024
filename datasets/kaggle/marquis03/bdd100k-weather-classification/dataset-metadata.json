The key frames are sampled at the 10th second of each video to obtain 100,000 images (image size: 1280*720), which are annotated with 10 categories of object bounding boxes, drivable areas, lane markers and full-frame instance segmentation. The dataset is geographically, environmentally and weather diverse. The dataset is divided into 70,000/10,000/20,000 for training/validation/testing respectively.
