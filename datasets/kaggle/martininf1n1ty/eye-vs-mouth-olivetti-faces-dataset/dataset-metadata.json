  "descriptionNullable": "Creating a Dataset of Eyes and Mouths from Face Images\n\nThis dataset is designed for the purpose of training and evaluating computer vision models for the detection and recognition of eyes and mouths within facial images. The dataset is generated from the Olivetti Faces dataset and includes extracted eye and mouth regions from the facial images. This dataset can be used for tasks such as facial feature detection, facial expression recognition, and facial landmark localization.\n\n### Dataset Description:\n\n- **Source Data**: The source data used to create this dataset is the Olivetti Faces dataset, which contains grayscale facial images of 40 different individuals, each with 10 different images. The images are of size 64x64 pixels.\n\n- **Generated Data**: From each facial image in the source dataset, two types of regions are extracted:\n    1. **Eyes**: Using a Haar Cascade classifier, the dataset includes cropped images of the detected eyes from each facial image. These images are resized to a standardized resolution.\n    2. **Mouths**: Similar to the process for eyes, the mouths in each facial image are detected using the Haar Cascade classifier, and cropped mouth regions are extracted and resized.\n\n- **Dataset Size**: The dataset includes multiple instances of eyes and mouths for each of the 40 individuals in the Olivetti Faces dataset. The number of samples for each individual varies depending on the presence and detection of eyes and mouths.\n\n- **Data Split**: The dataset is divided into two main categories: eyes and mouths. Each category contains subfolders for each individual, making it easy to access specific data for training or evaluation purposes.\n\n### Dataset Structure:\n\n- **Root Folder**: The root folder contains two subfolders:\n    1. `test_set/eye`: This folder contains images of detected eyes.\n    2. `test_set/mouth`: This folder contains images of detected mouths.\n\n- **Root Folder**: The root folder contains two subfolders:\n    1. `training_set/eye`: This folder contains images of detected eyes.\n    2. `training_set/mouth`: This folder contains images of detected mouths.\n\n- **Subfolders**: Each subfolder corresponds to a specific individual from the Olivetti Faces dataset. Inside each individual's subfolder, you will find the images of eyes and mouths extracted from their facial images.\n\n### Usage:\n\n- **Computer Vision Research**: Researchers and machine learning practitioners can use this dataset to develop and evaluate models for eye and mouth detection within facial images.\n\n- **Facial Expression Analysis**: The dataset can be employed in tasks related to facial expression analysis, as eyes and mouths are crucial for recognizing emotions and expressions.\n\n- **Facial Feature Localization**: It can be used for facial feature localization, which is important in applications such as face recognition and augmented reality.\n\n### Citation:\n\nIf you use this dataset in your research or projects, please consider citing the original source of the Olivetti Faces dataset, as well as any relevant publications or resources related to Haar Cascade classifiers for eye and mouth detection.\n\n### Acknowledgments:\n\nThis dataset was created by [Your Name] and is based on the Olivetti Faces dataset, which was originally collected by Olivetti Research Laboratory. We also acknowledge the OpenCV library for providing the Haar Cascade classifiers used in this dataset.\n\n### License:\n\nThe original Olivetti Faces dataset is provided for academic and non-commercial research purposes.
