This dataset is derived from the original Olivetti Faces dataset, which consists of grayscale images capturing different facial expressions under controlled lighting conditions. The augmented version includes images that have been subject to transformations such as horizontal flips, rotations, cropping, and resizing, as well as the addition of controlled noise.\n- The dataset contains a total of *2000* samples, each represented as a 2D matrix of pixel values. The original facial images are included, along with their horizontally flipped counterparts, images rotated by a small angle, cropped and resized versions, and images with added controlled noise. This augmented collection aims to provide a broader range of training data for machine learning models, especially those focused on facial recognition, image inpainting, and other computer vision tasks.\n\nResearchers and developers can utilize the Augmented Olivetti Faces Dataset to evaluate the robustness and generalization capabilities of their algorithms in the presence of diverse facial variations. Additionally, the dataset can serve as a valuable resource for exploring the impact of augmentations on model performance, and for experimenting with image processing techniques that enhance the reliability and effectiveness of facial recognition systems.\n\n\n\nDatasource: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html\nCredit to AT&T Laboratories Cambridge for images\n\n",
