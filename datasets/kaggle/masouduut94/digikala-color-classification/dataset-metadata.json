The data includes the images of various products which come in colors. I found it difficult to define a model to predict the color of the items. So I shared it here.\n\n### Content\n\nAll the images come in 224X224 pixels which is a great fit for famous models like VGG, AlexNet, Exception, .....\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI appreciate Digikala for investing so much in helping developers, AI engineers, and data scientists by providing open datasets in recent years.\n\n### Inspiration\nWho can find the best model to predict these tricky items? I will provide some handy notes I developed by R&D soon.",
