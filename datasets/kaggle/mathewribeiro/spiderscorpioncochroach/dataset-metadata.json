My original desire was to find scorpions before they found me or my loved ones, but thought spiders may be a strong false positive class. I lastly selected cockroaches because they're on the list of \"creepy creatures\" and they sort of look like most six-legged insects that happen upon my dwelling place.\n\n### Content\n\nI collected at least 300 images of each class. I was not looking for incredibly clear or pristine examples, but almost the opposite. I wanted images of what I thought an old cell phone might see positioned in a poorly lit corner of the room. I also included images of scorpions illuminated by a black light, because that is the only way you'd probably see them on a cell phone after dark.\n\nSince all images were collected through the same method, there really isn't a clear delineation between training and test, so for now all classes of images exist in the train folder.\n ",
