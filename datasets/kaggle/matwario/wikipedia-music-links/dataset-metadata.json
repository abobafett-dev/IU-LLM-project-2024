In the case of musical artists, links or mentions to articles of other peers can indicate relationships of influence, stylistic proximity, or even collaboration.\n\nTake the following excerpt extracted from the Wikipedia article on [The Rolling Stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones). Other artists that are referred to have been highlighted in bold.\n\n*\"Having a charting single gave the band entree to play outside London, starting with a booking at the Outlook Club in Middlesbrough on 13 July, sharing the billing with **the Hollies**. Later in 1963 Oldham and Easton arranged the band's first big UK concert tour as a supporting act for American stars including **Bo Diddley**, **Little Richard** and the **Everly Brothers**. The tour gave the band the opportunity to hone their stagecraft. During the tour the band recorded their second single, a **Lennon\u2013McCartney**-penned number entitled 'I Wanna Be Your Man'. The song was written and given to the Stones when **John Lennon** and **Paul McCartney** visited them in the studio as the two Beatles liked giving the copyrights to songs away to their friends.\"*\n\nIn just a few sentences we see how The Rolling Stones have historical links to many other artists. And this happens throughout the band's article as well as those from other bands and musicians around Wikipedia. The question, then, is: what insights can be produced via these links and mentions? In order to find out, the first step is building a dataset that maps these links throughout Wikipedia and stores them neatly in a file. This is the main purpose of this dataset.\n\n### Content\n\nFor the dataset to be generated exclusively with articles about musical artists, they had to be acquired manually from Wikipedia. The site employs categories to organize articles, and these can in turn be used in [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Export) so that a XML can be downloaded. This XML will have the full content of all articles from the informed category.\n\nThe dataset, as made available here, was created with articles/artists that fell into the following cateogories.\n\n* \"Musical groups established in 1950\" until \"Musical groups established in 2020\".\n* \"20th\\_century\\_american\\_rappers\" and \"21st\\_century\\_american\\_rappers\".\n* \"20th\\_century\\_american\\_singers\" and \"21st\\_century\\_american\\_singers\".\n* \"20th\\_century\\_australian\\_singers\" and \"21st\\_century\\_australian\\_singers\".\n* \"20th\\_century\\_brazilian\\_singers\" and \"21st\\_century\\_brazilian\\_singers\".\n* \"20th\\_century\\_canadian\\_singers\" and \"21st\\_century\\_canadian\\_singers\".\n* \"20th\\_century\\_english\\_singers\" and \"21st\\_century\\_english\\_singers\".\n* \"20th\\_century\\_french\\_singers\" and \"21st\\_century\\_french\\_singers\".\n\nThe final dataset is pretty simple, being made up of only three columns. One that lists the artist (ARTIST\\_NAME), another that shows the artists that are mentioned in that Wikipedia article as well as how many times those mentions occur (MENTIONED\\_ARTISTS), and one (ARTIST\\_CATEGORY) that has the Wikipedia category from which the article came.\n\n### What If I Wanted More or Less Artists?\n\nI have made the code that generated this dataset available on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/MatCorr/Wikipedia_Music_Tree). You can use it to create your own version of it or perhaps even enrich it in some way. Instructions on how to do so are there. You will have, however, to download the desired XMLs from Wikipedia. \n\nThe code, in its current version, has been parallelized but may take a little time to run depending on how many XMLs are used because there are a lot of text searches that need to be done.\n\nNote that, in the code, the category column (ARTIST\\_CATEGORY) is extracted from the name of the XML file that contains the raw article.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThis dataset can be used to:\n* Enrich music recommendation algorithms;\n* Calculate the similarity between artists according to the links of their articles;\n* Check if artists that come from the same categories have similar links;\n* Predict the year in which bands formed based on the links of their articles;\n* Use graph metrics to try to estimate how influential an artist is;\n* Use machine learning to do some link prediction;\n* Create graph visualizations of part of the data, such as this one, which was done using a few scripts you can also find on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/MatCorr/Wikipedia_Music_Tree) plus Gephi.\n\n![Mentions From Bob Dylan Article](https://github.com/MatCorr/Wikipedia_Music_Tree/blob/main/images/bob_dylan_mentions_from.png?raw=true)",
