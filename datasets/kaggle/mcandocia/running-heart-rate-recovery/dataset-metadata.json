This data corresponds to the stopwatch stop & start events.\n\n\n### Content\n\nEach row contains data from when I stopped my watch and started it again, as well as some summarized data over various time windows before the stop, as well as a few variables describing the overall run (e.g., average temperature, average longitude/latitude).\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI wanted to see how my heart rate dropped based on various variables. I've used nonlinear regression to get a decent model in terms of heart rate, rest time, and temperature, but it seems to overestimate heart rate recovery for higher temperatures in more intense runs.",
