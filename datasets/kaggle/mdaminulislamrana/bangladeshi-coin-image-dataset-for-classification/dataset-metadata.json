A., Birahim, S. A., Saha, P., Nur, A. H., and Hasan, M., (2024) \u2018*Bangladeshi Coin Image Dataset for Classification*\u2019. Kaggle. doi: 10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/8698465.\n\nOverview:\nThe Bangladeshi Coin Photo Dataset consists of 5760 high-resolution images of 1 taka (tk), 2 taka (tk), and 5 taka (tk) coins. The dataset was created to facilitate the development of automated systems for coin identification, with a specific application in vending machines that currently only accept banknotes. This dataset will support machine learning models aimed at recognizing and processing coin transactions, thereby expanding the functionality of vending machines to accept both coins and banknotes.\n\nData Collection:\n\nSource: The images were captured by four participants under controlled conditions.\nCollection Method: Each participant took photos of coins using a standardized setup to ensure consistency in image quality and angles.\nTime Period: The photos were taken over a period from May 5, 2024, to May 27, 2024.\n\nDataset Structure:\n\nData Format: JPEG images.\nData Size: 5760 photos, organized in directories by participant and coin type.\n\nContent Description:\n\nParticipants: Four individuals, each contributing 1440 photos.\nIndividual Contributions: Each participant took 1440 photos, including individual and paired coin images.\nCoins: Images of 1tk, 2tk, and 5tk coins.\nNumber of Coins: Each participant photographed 20 coins of each denomination.\n\nAngles and Views:\nIndividual Coins: Each coin was photographed from 8 different angles for both heads and tails.\nPaired Coins: Photos of pairs of coins taken from 8 different angles for both heads and tails.\nTotal Photos Per Participant: 1440 photos (960 for individual coins, 480 for paired coins).\n\nLimitations:\n\nData Quality: While efforts were made to standardize photo conditions, variations in lighting and minor positional differences may exist.\nBias: The dataset includes coins in various conditions, which could affect recognition accuracy in real-world applications.\n\nLimitations: The dataset does not include images of coins in circulation with significant wear and tear.",
