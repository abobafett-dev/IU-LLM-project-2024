A total of 2872 images were collected initially. After unlinking the damaged data, the total number of images was 2776.\n- **Dataloader:** Used FastAI DataBlock API to set up the DataLoader.\n- **Data Augmentation:** FastAI provides default data augmentation which operates in GPU.\n- **Data Cleaning:** Since I collected data from the browser, there were many noises. Also, some images contained irrelevant data. I cleaned and updated data using FastAI ImageClassifierCleaner.<br>\n#Acknowledgement\nPlease include citations for this dataset if you use it in your own research.<br>\n#Inspiration\nThis dataset can be used for sports ball classification.\n\n\n",
