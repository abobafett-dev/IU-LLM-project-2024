  "descriptionNullable": "# Description:\n- Butterflies are the adult flying stage of certain insects belonging to an order or group called Lepidoptera. The word \"Lepidoptera\" means \"scaly wings\" in Greek. This name perfectly suits the insects in this group because their wings are covered with thousands of tiny scales overlapping in rows.\n\n# Your Task:\n- Your Task is to build an Image Classification Model using CNN/ any model that classifies to which class of weather  each image belongs to.\n\n# Source:\n- [Data Sprint 72 - Butterfly Identification](https://dphi.tech/challenges/data-sprint-72-butterfly-identification/226/overview/about)\n- [Link to download Dataset](https://dphi-live.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dataset/butterflies.zip)\n\n# Data Description:\n- The dataset features 75 different classes of Butterflies. The dataset contains about 1000+ labelled images including the validation images. Each image belongs to only one butterfly category and are saved in separate folders of the labelled classes.\n\n# Folder Description:\n- Train - contains all the images that are to be used for training your model.  In this folder you will find 75 folders namely - 'SOUTHERN DOGFACE', 'ADONIS', 'BROWN SIPROETA', 'MONARCH','GREEN CELLED CATTLEHEART', 'CAIRNS BIRDWING','EASTERN DAPPLE WHITE', 'RED POSTMAN', 'MANGROVE SKIPPER',which contain the images of the respective butterflies.\n\n- Test - contains 2786 images of Butterflies. For these images you are required to make predictions as the respective class names -'SOUTHERN DOGFACE', 'ADONIS', 'BROWN SIPROETA', 'MONARCH','GREEN CELLED CATTLEHEART', 'CAIRNS BIRDWING'.\n\n- Testing_set.csv - this is the order of the predictions for each image that is to be submitted on the platform. Make sure the predictions you download are with their image\u2019s filename in the same order as given in this file.\n\n- sample_submission: This is a csv file that contains the sample submission for the data sprint.\n\n",
