Each record represents an individual collision, including the date, time and location of the accident (borough, zip code, street name, latitude/longitude), vehicles and victims involved, and contributing factors.\n\nRecommended Analysis\n- Compare the % of total accidents by month. Do you notice any seasonal patterns?\n- Break down accident frequency by day of week and hour of day. Based on this data, when do accidents occur most frequently?\n- On which particular street were the most accidents reported? What does that represent as a % of all reported accidents?\n- What was the most common contributing factor for the accidents reported in this sample (based on Vehicle 1)? What about for fatal accidents specifically?",
