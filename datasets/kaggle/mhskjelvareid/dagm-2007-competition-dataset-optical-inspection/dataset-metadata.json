The first six out of ten datasets, denoted as development datasets, are supposed to be used for algorithm development. The remaining four datasets, which are referred to as competition datasets, can be used to evaluate the performance.

The datasets are split 50/50 % in two folders named \"Train\" and \"Test\".\n- Each dataset is generated by a different texture model and defect model.\n- 'Non-defective' images show the background texture without defects, 'defective' images have exactly one labelled defect on the background texture.\n- All datasets has been randomly split into a training and testing sub-dataset of equal size.\n- Weak labels are provided as ellipses roughly indicating the defective area. Technically, defective images are augmented with a separate grayscale 8-bit image in the PNG format located in a subfolder named 'Label'. The values 0 and 255 denote background and defective area, respectively.\n\nAll meta-data is subsumed in a separate ASCII textfile called 'Labels.txt' which is located in the 'Label' folder. The structure is as follows: \n1 \\n \n[id of item no. 1] \\t [0 if non-defective, 1 if defective] \\t [filename of raw image no. 1] \\t 0 \\t [filename of label image no. 1 if defective, 0 otherwise] \\n \n... \n[id of item no.
