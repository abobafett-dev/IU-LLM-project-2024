NAMI has conducted multiple surveys verifying the high unemployment rate among those with mental illness, but this is the only survey to date which targets causation (why they are unemployed).

Survey Monkey stratifies the sample according to certain\n   characteristics like income and location.\n\n - I know that the general population sampling went well because the\n   number of people self identifying as having a mental illness is\n   consistent with larger samples.\n\n - Although we disqualified people without a mental illness, they were\n   still given the complete survey.
