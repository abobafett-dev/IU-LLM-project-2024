Star Wars hardly needs an introduction - a real pop culture icon, a movie classic, seen by millions of viewers around the world. In Star Wars humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with robots (typically referred to in the films as 'droids'), who may assist them in their daily routines; space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology. The basis of star wars is a trilogy of films created by George Lucas (a film from 1977, 1980 and 1983). In the years 1999\u20132005, he created a trilogy telling the story before the first trilogy with - The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002) and Revenge of the Sith (2005). 2015 saw the premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which ushered in a new sequel trilogy. In the following years, the next parts were released: The Last Jedi (2017) and Skywalker. Rebirth (2019).

The number of pictures in each series differ from each other during the data on imdb. Data was obtained using webscraping. Python was used for this process with the \"BeautifulSoup\", \"requests\", \"re\", \"urllib\", and \"os\" packages.
