One line represents data (such as average, peak, and month-to-month difference in average) for one game. So the database has a \"long\" format.\n\nThe data was downloaded from the [steamcharts](https://steamcharts.com/) website using webscraping. The R language was used for this purpose, especially the \"rvesrt\" package and a Chrome add-on called \"SelectorGadet\".

The database can be updated once a month, when data about it appear in the database after the end of the month and the number of rows grows.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThe data can be a great addition to previously published Steam databases, which are quite popular. It can also be used to compare different games over time. Anyway, only your imagination and common sense limit what you can do with any database!",
