The columns are:\n\n```SERIES``` - Internal code for dataset indicating Domain, species, and Status Review data set year and when applicable, method.\n\n```NMFS_POPID``` - The unique numeric value for a population as determined by NMFS. This value will not change over time, even if the population name (NWR Population Name) does.\n\n```RECOVERY_DOMAIN``` - Discrete geographic areas for which comprehensive recovery plans are being developed:&nbsp;Puget Sound,&nbsp;Willamette/Lower Columbia,&nbsp;Interior Columbia&nbsp;(including the Mid-Columbia, Upper Columbia, and Snake River sub-domains),&nbsp;Oregon Coast, and&nbsp;Southern/Oregon Northern California Coast.\n\n```ESU``` - For populations listed under the federal ESA, this is the name of a defined Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU) or Distinct Population Segment (DPS) as defined by NMFS Northwest Region or by USFWS.\n\n```MAJOR_POPULATION_GROUP``` - Major Population Group, as defined by the NWR.  Groups of populations within an ESU/DPS that are more similar to each other than they are to other populations.  They are based on similarities in genetic characteristics, demographic patterns and habitat types and on geographic structure.\n\n```POPULATION_NAME``` - Legal given name for a listed population within the ESU.\n\n```COMMON_POPULATION_NAME``` - Shortened population name\n\n```DISPLAY_ORDER``` - Geographically based display order within ESUs.\n\n```SPECIES``` - Salmon species name\n\n```RUN_TIMING``` - Run of fish, generally determined on the basis of the time of year at which adults enter fresh water to spawn. (Spring, Summer, Spring/Summer, Fall, Winter, early, or late)\n\n```STREAM_NAME``` - Name of the primary stream for the Population\n\n```YEAR``` - Calender year of return\n\n```NUMBER_OF_SPAWNERS``` - Estimated number of natural origin (parents spawned in the wild) spawners contributing to spawning in a particular year.&nbsp; Includes both adults and jacks of natural origin (except for SR fall chinook which typically does have jack returns)\n\n```FRACWILD``` - The fraction of the total spawners that are the progeny of naturally-spawning fish.\n\n```CATCH``` - Terminal fishery harvest\n\n```AGE_1_RETURNS``` - The fraction of fish who are defined as having an age of 1 that returned to spawn in a given year.\n\n```AGE_2_RETURNS``` - The fraction of fish who are defined as having an age of 2 that returned to spawn in a given year.\n\n```AGE_3_RETURNS``` - The fraction of fish who are defined as having an age of 3 that returned to spawn in a given year.\n\n```AGE_4_RETURNS``` - The fraction of fish who are defined as having an age of 4 that returned to spawn in a given year.\n\n```AGE_5_RETURNS``` - The fraction of fish who are defined as having an age of 5 that returned to spawn in a given year.\n\n```AGE_6_RETURNS``` - The fraction of fish who are defined as having an age of 6 that returned to spawn in a given year.\n\n```AGE_7_RETURNS``` - The fraction of fish who are defined as having an age of 7 that returned to spawn in a given year.\n\n```METHOD``` - Survey (spawning ground), Model (PIT tag data), or GSI (genetic stock inventory data), Ladder count (at dam)\n\n```CITATION``` - Data source citation\n\n```CONTRIBUTOR``` - Agency, Tribe or other entity responsible for these data that is the best contact for questions that may arise about this data record.\n\n```DOCUMENT_CITATION``` - Citation of the document this dataset archive informed.\n\n```CODE_LINK``` - Location of the code used to generate analysis for the document\n\n",
