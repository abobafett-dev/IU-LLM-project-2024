Of course, this statement causes the question of \"will the Monkeypox virus become Covid-19 2.0 or will it just be a disease that will come and go?\". To answer all of these questions, identifying a disease further is a wise\nis a wise step to achieve the welfare of life in a country or even the world. even the world. Unlike its name, Monkeypox is actually transmitted by rodents such as squirrels and mice. squirrels and rats. In addition, Monkeypox is also a virus that belongs to the group of Orthopoxvirus that originated from the African continent. This virus was first discovered in 1958 in Denmark and attacked a group of monkeys who were research subjects in a laboratory. laboratory. Monkeypox cases are commonly found in African countries, such as Congo and Nigeria, but in 2019 cases of Monkeypox were detected in Singapore, Israel, and the United Kingdom. In fact, after the slope of this case, in 2022 it resurfaced in 20 countries with more than 200 cases. countries with over 200 cases.\n\nMonkeypox virus can be transmitted from animals to humans through scratches or bites from infected rodents and primates, as well as direct contact with their body fluids or the consumption of undercooked infected meat. The virus can also spread from human to human through saliva droplets entering through the eyes, mouth, nose, or wounds, as well as through contaminated objects. According to the British Medical Journal, there are nine symptoms or factors that can indicate exposure to the virus, including muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, fever, rectal pain, sore throat, penile edema, oral lesions, swollen tonsils, and certain infections such as HIV. However, experiencing these symptoms does not necessarily mean immediate infection. \n\nAccording to the given text, further analysis is necessary to determine the likelihood of someone being infected with the Monkeypox virus based on certain symptoms. The first symptom is related to a systemic disease, which can affect all organs in the body, making it difficult to identify. In the case of the Monkeypox virus, systemic illness includes muscle pain, swollen lymph nodes, and fever. Other symptoms may include pain in the rectum, swollen tonsils, edema of the penis, and sore throat. Patients with the Monkeypox virus can also have lesions or sores containing clear or yellowish fluid on various parts of the body, which typically appear three days after the onset of fever. Additionally, there is a close association between the Monkeypox virus and sexually transmitted infections, such as a rash in the pubic area, which can be transmitted through sexual contact with an infected person. It is also noted that individuals with HIV infection are more likely to have the Monkeypox virus, although the correlation between the two is still relatively low. A study from the CDC suggests that the prevalence of people with both HIV and the Monkeypox virus is increasing.\n\nIn order to prevent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic from happening again, it is necessary to make efforts to prevent pandemic events. One of the efforts to prevent infection is segregation between healthy people and infected people.\n\nDataset Information:\n1.
