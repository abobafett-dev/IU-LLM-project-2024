  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nThis dataset contains total per capita (15+ years) alcohol consumption (in liters of pure alcohol)  collected by WHO for 2000-2019 (**Indicator ID 465**). \n\nIf you want to take a look at the more detailed consumption, aggregated by beverage type, I'd suggest taking a look either in one of other Kaggle datasets or [WHO's alcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.imr.SA_0000001400?lang=en) indicator.\n\nThis dataset was necessary for my current project I'm working on which concerns suicide rates and different factors correlating with them.\n\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe data is broken up by geographic region, country, year and sex. The period covered is 2000-2019. \n\nThe total alcohol per capita consumption (APC) comprises both the recorded and the unrecorded APC, which together provide a more accurate estimate of the level of alcohol consumption in a country, and as a result, portray trends of alcohol consumption in the adult population (15 years of age and older) in a more precise way. Drinking alcohol can associated with developing alcohol use disorder or dependence and higher risk of mental and behavioral disorders. It is a major risk for liver cirrhosis, some cancers and cardiovascular diseases as well as injuries resulting from violence and accidents. Beyond health consequences, the harmful use of alcohol brings significant social and economic losses to individuals, their families and society at large. \n\nTotal APC is defined as the total (sum of three-year average recorded and three-year average unrecorded APC, adjusted for three-year average tourist consumption) amount of alcohol consumed per adult (15+ years) over a calendar year, in liters of pure alcohol. Recorded alcohol consumption refers to official statistics (production, import, export, and sales or taxation data), while the unrecorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is outside the usual system of governmental control. Tourist consumption takes into account tourists visiting the country and inhabitants visiting other countries. Positive figures denote alcohol consumption of outbound tourists being greater than alcohol consumption by inbound tourists, negative numbers the opposite. Tourist consumption is based on UN tourist statistics. \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe data is obtained from the World Health Organization Global Health Observatory that is [issued](https://www.who.int/about/policies/publishing/copyright) under [the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Intergovernmental Organization (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO) licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/igo/).\nWHO collects and provides access to the huge amount of data that is used by analysts every day.

While detailed beverage type information is not present in this dataset, total alcohol consumption might be useful in analyzing alcohol consumption differences between countries and get interesting insights combining this data with mental health or tourist behavior, for example.",
