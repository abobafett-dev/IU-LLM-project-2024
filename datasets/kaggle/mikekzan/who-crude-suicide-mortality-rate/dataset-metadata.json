  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nThis dataset contains crude suicide rates (number of suicide deaths in a year, divided by the population and multiplied by 100 000) collected by WHO for 2000-2019 (**Indicator ID 4664**). \n\nThis dataset was necessary for my current project I'm working on which concerns suicide rates and different factors correlating with them.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe data is broken up by geographic region, country, year, sex and age group. The period covered is 2000-2019 (WHO post-Covid data is not available yet). Sadly, the age groups are only available for 2019. Both suicide rates and high/low estimations are available (high/low estimations are set to null when the data quality is high enough).\n\nSuicide rates are estimations estimates are derived from the WHO Global Health Estimates (GHE). For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths, unknown age and sex, and ill-defined causes of deaths. For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies. These estimates represent the best estimates of WHO, computed using standard categories, definitions and methods to ensure cross-country comparability, and may not be the same as official national estimates. \n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe data is obtained from the World Health Organization Global Health Observatory that is [issued](https://www.who.int/about/policies/publishing/copyright) under [the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Intergovernmental Organization (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO) licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/igo/).\nWHO collects and provides access to the huge amount of data that is used by analysts every day.

What factors affect suicide rates? Do these factors work differently between different countries or population groups? How changes in country policies or economy affect suicide rates over the years?",
