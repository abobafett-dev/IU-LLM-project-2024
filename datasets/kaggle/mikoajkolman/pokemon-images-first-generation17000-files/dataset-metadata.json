For that we have created this dataset.\nThe images are cleaned and somewhat cropped. It's not perfect, but it's decent and useable.\n\n### Content\n\nThere are 143 directories for each Pokemon from the first generation except for Nidoran male and female. I don't quite remember why, but I do remember there was some kind of problem with those so I have dropped them. The number of files in each directory is not equal. It ranges from 50 to 200 files.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe data was created as a combination of [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thedagger/pokemon-generation-one) and one more, but it was a long time ago and I can't find the second one.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI'm no expert on computer vision, but what might be an interesting thing about this data is that because of the evolutions of the Pokemon many, that are related, are quite similar to each other, so I bet there is something to do with that as an alternative to just regular classification.",
