One of the Frameworks I read about uses a peak detection algorithm to cluster tweets by topic-aware peak times. I started wondering if there are any interesting peak detection approaches that manage to determine the amount of global peaks and peak coordinates. Feel free to play around with the data and provide your peak detection algorithms! They don't necessarily have to be machine learning algorithms.",
