So far we have achieved this mission by;\n\n * working directly with patients and patient support groups (such as ALS-liga Belgium) to deliver BCI technologies directly to end users,\n * partnering with groups in sectors interested in adding brain control, such as VR gaming or home automation, to develop product prototypes,\n * direct sales of complete BCI development kits to makers and hackers interested developing brain controlled projects from our kickstarter campaign.\n\nModern BCIs (including our own) rely heavily on machine learning techniques to process the noisy data gathered from EEG sensors and cope with the high degree of variability in responses over different individuals and environments. MindAffect firmly believes that the key to enabling the new BCI applications we all want is a combination of more sophisticated machine learning algorithms and larger and more diverse datasets on which to train these algorithms\n\n### Content\n\nAs a first step to enabling machine learning experts to improve the BCI experience, we are publishing our internal testing datasets and the analysis codes used to develop and refine our own algorithms.  We hope these datasets will help people in developing new and improved algorithms for this type of data.  \n\nInitially, we have committed about 60 datasets from our of our development team.  We are committed to adding more datasets to this as we gather them to try and build as large as possible database of cVEP EEG data for algorithm development.    Further, as more users gather their own data with our [open-source bci](github.com/mindaffect/pymindaffectBCI), we hope they will be willing to donate their own datasets to rapidly gather a large and diverse dataset for further algorithm enhancement.  \n\nSpecifically, this dataset was gathered by one of our developers in Nijmegen in the Netherlands using our on-line bci system exactly as shown in this [video](https://youtu.be/EeXUEkGqD98)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset was gathered and donated by MindAffect B.V.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nWhat can you do with this data?\n 1. Get better performance in less time? How about using a deep-learning approach? \n 2. Generalize your algorithm to transfer between data-sets so the user does not have to re-calibrate for each new data-set?\n 3. Generalize over multiple users (as we add new user data?)\n 4. Generalize to different BCI types (as we add P300 and SSVEP datasets..)",
