The food and agricultural sectors are immensely diverse and they require advanced technologies and efficiencies that rely on computer technologies, big data, cloud-based data storage, and internet accessibility.

For many years, CPU has operated a static distribution topology. In the last year, CPU has introduced novel smart technology to enable remote data collection from sensors in the field, and remote control of actuators. Shortly after that new technology has been introduced, anomalous low levels in Tank T5 and high levels in Tank T1 were observed. A month later, a water overflow in Tank T1 occurred. While CPU personnel at the control center were able to see the anomalous readings for the first two episodes, Tank T1 overflow took place unexpectedly while the water level readings were always below the alarm thresholds and pumping operations appeared to be normal. Searching for the causes, CPU engineers suspect potential cyber-attacks for all these episodes. In particular, they are considering adversaries that are able to activate and deactivate the actuators in C-Town, as well as altering the readings of the sensors deployed in the network and the reported status of actuators, and interfering with the connections established between networked components. The participants' task is thus to develop an online alert system for cyber-physical attacks.\n\n**Additional Information About The Dataset From Other Papers:**\n- SCADA data are real-time, field-based network measurements (tank water level, pump flow, etc.) transmitted to the central system by programmable logic controllers (PLCs)\n- C-Town consists of **388 nodes linked** with **429 pipes** and is **divided into 5 district metered areas (DMAs)**.\n- More specifically, the SCADA data include the water level at all **7 tanks of the network (T1\u2013T7)**, status and flow of all **11 pumps (PU1\u2013PU11)** and the one actuated **valve (V2)** of the network, and **pressure at 24 pipes** of the network that correspond to the inlet and outlet pressure of the pumps and the actuated valve.\n\n<img src=\"https://ascelibrary.org/cms/asset/1375ee5f-cc1e-498f-8a03-1180c61ee9fe/figure1.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n\n**Graph Annotation:**\n- **L_T** #: water level of a tank # **[meter]**.\u200b\n- **S_PU** # or **S_V** # : status of a pump # or a valve # **[dmnl]**.

The dataset **does not contain any attacks**, i.e. all the data pertains to C-Town normal operations.\n- Training Dataset 2: This dataset with partially labeled data was released on November 28 2016. The dataset is around 6 months long and contains **several attacks**, some of which are approximately labeled.\n- Test Dataset: This 3-months long dataset contains **several attacks but no labels**. The dataset was released on February 20 2017, and it is used to compare the performance of the algorithms (see rules document for details).\n\n\n### Notes\n- More information about the BATADAL dataset and the 2017-2018 competition can be found in [here](https://www.batadal.net/index.html). Paper of the competition is publicly available [here](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10104860).\n- The dataset is created and published by the [BATADAL team](https://www.batadal.net/index.html).

If there are any additional changes or questions regarding the dataset, please don't hesitate to contact me.\n- This is a very good dataset (I would consider it as one of the two benchmark datasets, besides [SWaT dataset](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/dataset_info/)) in the applied AI in water distribution research. Many research papers have been published, but only a handful published their codes and analysis. I hope to bring Kagglers' awareness and attention to this field, experience, and contribute.
