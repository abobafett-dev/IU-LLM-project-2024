It consists of two columns: **temperature** and **the corresponding number of units of ice cream sold.**\n\nThe dataset captures the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales. It serves as a practical example for understanding and implementing polynomial regression, a powerful technique for modeling **nonlinear relationships** in data.\n\nThe dataset is designed to be straightforward and easy to work with, making it ideal for **beginners**. The simplicity of the data allows beginners to focus on the **fundamental concepts** and steps involved in polynomial regression without overwhelming complexity.\n\nBy using this dataset, beginners can gain hands-on experience in ***preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, selecting an appropriate degree for the polynomial regression model, training the model, and evaluating its performance.*** They can also explore techniques to address potential challenges such as overfitting.\n\nWith this dataset, beginners can practice making predictions of ice cream sales based on temperature inputs and visualize the polynomial regression curve that represents the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales.\n\nOverall, the Ice Cream Selling dataset provides an accessible and practical learning resource for beginners to grasp the concepts and techniques of polynomial regression in the context of analyzing ice cream sales data.",
