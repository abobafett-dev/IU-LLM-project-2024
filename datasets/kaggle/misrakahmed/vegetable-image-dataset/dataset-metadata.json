The vegetables that are chosen for the experimentation are- bean, bitter gourd, bottle gourd, brinjal, broccoli, cabbage, capsicum, carrot, cauliflower, cucumber, papaya, potato, pumpkin, radish and tomato. A total of 21000 images from 15 classes are used where each class contains 1400 images of size 224\u00d7224 and in *.jpg format. The dataset split 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing purpose.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains three folders:\n\n- train (15000 images)\n- test (3000 images)\n- validation (3000 images)\neach of the above folders contains subfolders for different vegetables wherein the images for respective vegetables are present.\n\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe images in this dataset were collected by us from  vegetable farm and market for a project.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to give thanks to the people who helped us regarding data collection.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nFrom vegetable production to delivery, several common steps are operated manually. Like picking, and sorting vegetables. Therefore, we decided to solve this problem using deep neural architecture, by developing a model that can detect and classify vegetables. That model can be implemented in different types of devices and can also solve other problems related to the identification of vegetables, like labeling the vegetables automatically without any need for human work.",
