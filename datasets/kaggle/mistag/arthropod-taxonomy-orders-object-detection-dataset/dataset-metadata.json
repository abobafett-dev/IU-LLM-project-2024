But generally we want to identify ALL species present in an image. Thankfully, biologists and taxonomists have systematically classified and ordered organisms in a taxonomic hierarchy. The **ArTaxOr** data set covers arthropods, which includes insects, spiders, crustaceans, centipedes, millipedes etc. There are more than 1.3 million species of arthropods described. Creating a single dataset to cover all those is not feasible. However, the identification problem can be broken down into multiple tasks, starting with object detection at order level (there are &gt;120 orders of arthropods), then followed by family classification and finally species classification, as illustrated below:\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F2853415%2Ff27a0ecb6267d5d3f1272c54ba11bf88%2FArTaxOr.png?generation=1571496178803902&alt=media)\n\nNotice though, many species (maybe most) cannot be identified to species level from a photo only, but requires study of microscopic details not visible in a photo.
