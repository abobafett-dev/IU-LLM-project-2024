  "descriptionNullable": "Mangrove Institute of Science and Technology is a private polytechnic in the southern region of Bangladesh. It\u2019s a leading Polytechnique institute in Bangladesh. The institute is offering online learning since 2017. In an effort to improve the effectiveness of online learning, it has led a project titled \u201cUbiquitous Learning: Technology Assisted Support (UTAS)\u201d with a team of researchers to investigate students\u2019 emotional responses during online learning. The objective is to make the institution\u2019s learning management system more advantageous for the students by making it emotionally responsive to them in order to improve its overall effectiveness. Therefore, an experiment was conducted with a group of students where their facial expressions were captured using video cameras, and their interaction with the LMS was recorded using screen recording software. The objectives of this study were explained to students and requested their consent to record their facial expressions before the study. The recording of the facial expressions and storing of videos adhered to ethical review committee guidelines. This collected data set we titled \u201cEmoDetect\u201d contains video recordings students\u2019 facial expressions while working to meet some learning objectives using a LMS. It involves several facial action units that participants demonstrated during the recorded sessions. These action units are the combinations representing joy, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, frustration, fear and so forth, which are significant for the research community for the automatic detection of emotion in online learning using machine learning algorithms. We hope the dataset will contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of educational technology.\n\nFor requesting EmoDetect complete dataset, only Lab Managers, Professors or Students using their academic email account should fill out the [request form](https://forms.gle/xKJa361AADMLcPZc7).
