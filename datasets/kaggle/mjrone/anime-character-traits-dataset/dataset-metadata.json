It contains data about the physical and temperamental qualities of many popular anime characters. The traits are stored in the 'tags' column, and can either be read in as a python list, or parsed using regular expressions to get individual traits. I should also mention the index, which is the popularity ranking of each character in the database, and can be used to rank popular traits or for other such uses.",
