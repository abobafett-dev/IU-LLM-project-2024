  "descriptionNullable": "# Introduction\n\nLife expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing\npatterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life. It is a key\nmetric for assessing population health.\n\n\nLife expectancy has burgeoned since the advent of industrialization in the early 1900s and the world average has now more than doubled to 70 years. Yet, we still see inequality in life expectancy across and within countries. The study by Acemoglu and Johnson demonstrated the relationship between increased life expectancy\nand improvement in economic growth (GDP per capita), controlling for country-fixed effects [3]. In the\ntable below, we have shown how life expectancy varies between high-income and low-income countries.\nHowever, further analysis is necessary to determine how the allocation of a country\u2019s wealth through\ncertain investments in healthcare, education, environmental management, and some socioeconomic\nfactors have an overall effect in determining average life expectancy.\n\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F2798169%2F628ce779038d936de99db54cf792ce8d%2Fle_reg.png?generation=1693904967765822&alt=media)\n\nThe Sub-Saharan African region experiences the lowest life expectancy at birth compared to other\nregions over the past 3 decades.  SSA countries have consistently ranked as the lowest-earning countries in terms of\nGDP per capita. Therefore, there is a huge scope for improvement in life expectancy in SSA countries\nand hence our research focuses on the 40 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries with the lowest GDP per\ncapita\n\n\n# Research Questions\n\nAfter reviewing the rich existing literature on Life Expectancy, we realized the lack of concrete\nresearch on understanding the impact of all-encompassing determinants that cover socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors for SSA countries using Panel Data techniques. Hence, we tried to address this\ninadequacy through our research. In this paper, we aim to have a better understanding of factors affecting\nlife expectancy in the SSA region for an efficient policy-making process and better allocation of funds\nand resources in addressing the prevalence of low life expectancy in Sub-Saharan Africa. To achieve that\nwe attempt to answer the following questions in this research:\n\n1. What\u2019s the Impact of Expenditure on Health and Education (% of GDP) on Life Expectancy?\n2. How does the prevalence of undernourishment and communicable disease Affect Life Expectancy?\n3. Do factors like corruption and unemployment rate impact life expectancy? If yes, quantify\n4. Increase in CO2 emissions decrease life expectancy? Is it significant?\n\n\n\n# Data \n\nMain sources of data - [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/) & [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)\n\n1. Country - 174 countries - [list](https://github.com/Shritej24c/Econometrics/blob/main/list%20of%20countries.txt)\n\n2. Country Code - 3-letter code\n\n3. Region - region of the world country is located in\n\n4. IncomeGroup - country's income class \n\n5. Year - 2000-2019 (both included) \n\n6. Life expectancy - data\n\n7. Prevalence of Undernourishment (% of the population) - Prevalence of undernourishment is the\npercentage of the population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the dietary\nenergy levels that are required to maintain a normally active and healthy life\n\n\n8. Carbon dioxide emissions (kiloton) - Carbon dioxide emissions are those stemming from the burning\nof fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement. They include carbon dioxide produced during the\nconsumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels and gas flaring\n\n\n9. Health Expenditure (% of GDP) - Level of current health expenditure expressed as a percentage of GDP. Estimates of current health expenditures include healthcare goods and services consumed during each year. This indicator does not include capital health expenditures such as buildings,\nmachinery, IT, and stocks of vaccines for emergencies or outbreaks\n\n10.  Education Expenditure (% of GDP) - General government expenditure on education (current,\ncapital, and transfers) is expressed as a percentage of GDP. It includes expenditures funded by\ntransfers from international sources to the government. General government usually refers to local,\nregional, and central governments.\n\n11.  Unemployment (% total labor force) - Unemployment refers to the % share of the labor force that\nis without work but available for and seeking employment\n\n12.  Corruption (CPIA rating) - Transparency, accountability, and corruption in the public sector assets\nthe extent to which the executive can be held accountable for its use of funds and for the results\nof its actions by the electorate and by the legislature and judiciary, and the extent to which public employees within the executive are required to account for administrative decisions, use of resources,\nand results obtained.\n\n13.  Sanitation - People using safely managed sanitation services (% of the population): The percentage of people using improved sanitation facilities that are not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite. Improved sanitation facilities include flush/pour flush to piped sewer systems, septic tanks, or pit latrines: ventilated improved pit latrines, compositing toilets, or pit latrines with slabs.\nWHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (washdata.org).\n\n14.  Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) due to Injuries - One DALY represents\nthe loss of the equivalent of one year of full health. DALYs for an injury or health\ncondition is the sum of the years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) and the years\nlived with a disability (YLDs) due to prevalent cases of the disease in a population\n\n15.  Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) due to Communicable diseases - One DALY represents\nthe loss of the equivalent of one year of full health. DALYs for a communicable disease or health\ncondition is the sum of the years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) and the years\nlived with a disability (YLDs) due to prevalent cases of the disease in a population\n\n16.  Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) due to Non-Communicable diseases - One DALY represents\nthe loss of the equivalent of one year of full health. DALYs for a non-communicable disease or health\ncondition is the sum of the years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) and the years\nlived with a disability (YLDs) due to prevalent cases of the disease in a population\n\n\nIf you find it useful, please support by upvoting \u2764\ufe0f\n",
