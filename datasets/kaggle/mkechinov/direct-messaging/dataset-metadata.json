  "descriptionNullable": "### About\n\nThis dataset contains multi-channel messages of medium sized online store for 2 years.\n\nChannels: email, web push, mobile push, SMS.\n\nCampaign types: bulk, triggers, transactional.\n\nNotice: this dataset contains `messages-demo.csv` file limited to 10M messages. The full file with 721M messages is available here: [messages.csv](https://data.rees46.com/datasets/direct-messaging/messages.csv.gz) (21.5Gb).\n\nData collected by [REES46 CDP](https://rees46.com/) project. \n\n### Files description\n\n**Here is a brief description of files. You can find the detailed description of every property in [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/direct-messaging-campaigns-dataset-overview).**\n\n#### holidays.csv\n\nBulk campaigns usually set before holidays and sale outs. This file contains not full list of Russian holidays and commerce activities so you can see how bulk campaigns are related to these dates.\n\n#### campaigns.csv\n\nAll messages are related to some kind of campaigns:\n\n1. Bulk campaigns are sent for sale outs and before holidays to stimulate sales and bring back customers.\n2. Trigger messages (like abandoned cart) are sent automatically based on user's behavior. More users visited website/app \u2013 more trigger messages are sent.\n3. Transactional messages are used for some kind of information delivery process: bonuses added, order delivery status changed, etc.\n\nKeep in mind: `campaign_id` is unique only for the specific `campaign_type`. Two campaigns with different `campaign_type` can have the same `campaign_id`. So the unique campaign identifier is `campaign_type + campaign_id`.\n\nAdditional properties are added to every campaign to describe its meaning (topic) or subject parameters (emoji, call to action, etc).\n\n#### messages.csv or messages-demo.csv\n\n`Messages` table contains a list of all messages sent with its statuses and meta info:\n\n1. Campaign\n2. Channel\n3. Type\n4. Opened (when)\n5. Clicked (when)\n6. Purchase \n7. Etc. See attached dataset for detailed info of every property\n\n#### client_first_purchase_date.csv\n\nThe file has 2 columns:\n\n1. Client ID\n2. Date of the first purchase ever\n\n\n\n### More datasets\n\nCheckout another datasets:\n\n1. https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store\n2. https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-purchase-history-from-electronics-store\n3. https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-events-history-in-cosmetics-shop\n4. https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-purchase-history-from-jewelry-store \n5. https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-events-history-in-electronics-store\n6. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-purchase-history-from-jewelry-store\n7.
