One of these potentials is object detection. Recent object detection which is based on deep learning models has achieved promising results concerning the finding of an object in images. The objective of this paper is to annotate and localize the medical face mask objects in real-life images. Wearing a medical face mask in public areas, protect people from COVID-19 transmission among them. The proposed model consists of two components. The first component is designed for the feature extraction process based on the ResNet-50 deep transfer learning model. While the second component is designed for the detection of medical face masks based on YOLO v2. Two medical face masks datasets have been combined in one dataset to be investigated through this research. To improve the object detection process, mean IoU has been used to estimate the best number of anchor boxes. The achieved results concluded that the adam optimizer achieved the highest average precision percentage of 81% as a detector. Finally, a comparative result with related work has been presented at the end of the research. The proposed detector achieved higher accuracy and precision than the related work.\n\n\n### Context\n\nThis Dataset conducted its experiments based on two public medical face mask datasets. The first dataset is Medical Masks Dataset (MMD)published by Mikolaj Witkowski (https://www.kaggle.com/vtech6/me dical-masks-dataset). The MMD dataset consists of 682 pictures with over 3k medical masked faces wearing masks. The second public masked face dataset is a Face Mask Dataset (FMD)in (https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection). The FMD dataset consists of 853 images. We created a new dataset by combining MMD and FMD. The merged dataset contains 1415 images by removing bad quality images and redundancy\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nCite our papers:\nMohamed Loey, Gunasekaran Manogaran, Mohamed Hamed N.
