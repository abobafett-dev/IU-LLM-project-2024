Using a modified Pok\u00e9mon dataset acquired from Kaggle.com, I created example code for students demonstrating how to explore data with R.\n\nBarradas provides the following description of each variable. I have modified the variable names to make them easier to deal with.\n\n- **Num:** ID for each Pok\u00e9mon.\n- **Name:** Name of each Pok\u00e9mon.\n- **Type1:** Each Pok\u00e9mon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks.\n- **Type2:** Some Pok\u00e9mon are dual type and have 2.\n- **HP:** Hit points, or health, defines how much damage a Pok\u00e9mon can withstand before fainting.\n- **Attack:** The base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch).\n- **Defense:** The base damage resistance against normal attacks.\n- **SPAtk:** Special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam).\n- **SPDef:** The base damage resistance against special attacks.\n- **Speed:** Determines which Pok\u00e9mon attacks first each round.\n- **Generation:** Number of generation.\n- **Legendary:** True if Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, False if not.\n",
