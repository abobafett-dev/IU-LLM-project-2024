Though I was able to find out many datasets for Object detection and classification perse, finding a dataset that is not COCO for instance segmentation was hard. I could also have gotten images from the Open image dataset along with their annotations. But that meant that I had to download all the mask images for the whole OID. Something I didn't want to do. So I got to create one myself.  \n\n# Content\nThis dataset contains 81 image segmentations each for 5 Simpson's main characters (Homer, Lisa, Bert, Marge, and Maggie). I have taken these images from [the Simpsons Characters Data](https://www.kaggle.com/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset?select=simpsons_dataset) which is also on Kaggle. The Simpsons characters dataset had a lot of images, so I selected the first 80 for each of these 5 characters to manually annotate masks. \n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F108364%2F530e032c63c3ab1b6602d9cc6cfe9fcf%2Fsimpdataset.png?generation=1600521907170542&alt=media)\n\n# File Descriptions:\n\n1. `instances.json` : Contains annotations for files in `img` folder in COCO format.\n2. `img` folder: contains images that I selected(81 per character) for annotation from the simpsons_dataset directory in Simpsons Characters Data.\n3. `test_images` folder: Contains all the other images that I didn't annotate from the simpsons_dataset directory in Simpsons Characters Data.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nTo the original author of Simpsons Character Dataset\n\n### Inspiration\n\nCan you find the pixel for Bart Simpson?",
