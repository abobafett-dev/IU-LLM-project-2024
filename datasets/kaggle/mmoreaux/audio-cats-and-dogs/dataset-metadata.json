In [Accessing the Dataset 2][2] we propose a train / test split which can be used.\n\nAll the WAV files contains 16KHz audio and have variable length.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe have not much credit in proposing the dataset here. Much of the work have been done by the [AE-Dataset][3] creator (From which we extracted the two classes) and by the humans behind [FreeSound][4] From which was extracted the AE-Dataset.\n\nPS: the AE-Dataset has a policy saying you can mention them: Naoya Takahashi, Michael Gygli, Beat Pfister and Luc Van Gool, \"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Data Augmentation for Acoustic Event Recognition\", Proc. Interspeech 2016, San Fransisco. \n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nYou might use this dataset to test raw audio classification challenge ;)  \nA more challenging dataset is available [here][5]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/visualizing-woofs-meows\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmoreaux/accessing-the-data-2/\n  [3]: https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/ae_dataset/\n  [4]: https://freesound.org/\n  [5]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmoreaux/environmental-sound-classification-50",
