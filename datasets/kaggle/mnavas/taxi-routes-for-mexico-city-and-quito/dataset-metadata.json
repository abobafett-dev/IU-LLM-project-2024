Due to the ability to verify that you are charged fairly, our App is very popular in several cities. We encourage our users to send us URLs with the taxi/transportation fees in their cities to keep growing our database.\n\n\u2605 Our App gets the available fares for your location based on your GPS, perfect when traveling and not getting scammed.\n\n\u2605 Users can start a taximeter in their own phone and check they are charged fairly\n\n\u2605 Several useful information is displayed to the user during the ride: Speed, Wait time, Distance, GPS update, GPS precision, Range of error.\n\n\u2605 Each fare has information available for reference like: Schedule, Minimum fee, Source, Last update.\n\n\u2605 It\u2019s possible to surf through several cities and countries which fares are available for use. If a fare is not in the app, now it\u2019s easier than ever to let us know thanks to Questbee Apps.\n\nWe invite users to contribute to our project and expect this data set to be useful, please don't hesitate to contact us to info@ashkadata.com to add your city or to contribute with this project.\n\n### Content\n\nThe data is collected from June 2016 until July 20th 2017.

Hence, we encourage data scientist to explore it and trim the data a little bit\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe have to acknowledge the valuable help of our users, who have contributed to generate this dataset and have push our growth by mouth to mouth recommendation.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nOur first inspiration for the App was after being scammed in our home city Quito. We started it as a tool for people to be fairly charged when riding a taxi. Currently with other transportation options available, we also help user to compare fares in their cities or the cities which they are visiting.\n\n###File descriptions\n\n    mex_clean.csv - the dataset contains information of routes in Mexico City\n    uio_clean.csv - the dataset contains information of routes in Quito Ecuador\n    bog_clean.csv - the dataset contains information of routes in Bogota\n    all-data_clean.csv - the dataset contains information of routes in different cities",
