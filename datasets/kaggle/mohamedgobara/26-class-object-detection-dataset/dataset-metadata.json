Each class represents a common urban or outdoor element encountered in various scenarios. The dataset includes the following classes:\n\nBench\nBicycle\nBranch\nBus\nBushes\nCar\nCrosswalk\nDoor\nElevator\nFire Hydrant\nGreen Light\nGun\nMotorcycle\nPerson\nPothole\nRat\nRed Light\nScooter\nStairs\nStop Sign\nTraffic Cone\nTrain\nTree\nTruck\nUmbrella\nYellow Light\nThese classes encompass a wide range of objects commonly encountered in urban and outdoor environments, including transportation vehicles, traffic signs, pedestrian-related elements, and natural features. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating object detection models, particularly those focused on urban scene understanding and safety applications.",
