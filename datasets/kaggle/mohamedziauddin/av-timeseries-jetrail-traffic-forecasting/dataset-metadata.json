  "descriptionNullable": "\n\n**About Time Series :**\nTime Series forecasting & modelling plays an important role in data analysis. Time series analysis is a specialized branch of statistics used extensively in fields such as Econometrics & Operation Research.\n\nTime Series is being widely used in analytics & data science. This is specifically designed time series problem for you and challenge is to forecast traffic.\n\n\nProblem Statement :\nYou are helping out Unicorn Investors with your data hacking skills. They are considering making an investment in a new form of transportation - JetRail. JetRail uses Jet propulsion technology to run rails and move people at a high speed! While JetRail has mastered the technology and they hold the patent for their product, the investment would only make sense, if they can get more than 1 Million monthly users with in next 18 months.\n \nYou need to help Unicorn ventures with the decision. They usually invest in B2C start-ups less than 4 years old looking for pre-series A funding. In order to help Unicorn Ventures in their decision, you need to forecast the traffic on JetRail for the next 7 months. You are provided with traffic data of JetRail since inception in the test file.\n\n\n**Data Description**\nTrain Set\n*Train.csv \u2013 File containing features related to travel Datetime and Count of passengers travelled on travel ID basis*\n\nTest Set\n*Test.csv \u2013 File containing features related to travel Datetime. Need to predict the Count of passengers travelled for each travel ID.*\n\nSample Submission:\n*ID: Unique id for each travel\nCount: Count of passengers travelled w.r.t each travel id in test data*\n\n\n**Evaluation Metric:**\nRoot Mean Squre Error (RMSE) is the evaluation metric used\n\n\n\n**Acknowledgements**\nMore details can be found on Analytics Vidhya website who conducted the hackathon.\nhttps://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-time-series-2/#ProblemStatement\n",
