  "descriptionNullable": "# **Uncovering Knowledge: A Clean Brain Tumor Dataset for Advanced Medical Research**\n\n### Introduction:\n- This dataset, available in RAR archive format, consists of four classes, including three tumor classes (Pituitary, Glioma and Meningioma) and one class representing normal brain MRI scans. \n- The strength of this dataset in comparison with other releases across the Kaggle is the cleanness of data. In this regard, we subjected the initial dataset to a meticulous data cleaning pipeline. This pipeline involved several steps aimed at enhancing the dataset's integrity and usability.\n- The initial data source for this dataset is the brain tumor classification MRI dataset, which can be accessed at this **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)**. \n\n### Data Cleaning Process:\n\n- **Removal of Duplicate Samples**: We employed an image vector comparison method to identify and remove duplicate samples, ensuring that each data point is unique.\n- **Correction of Mislabeled Images**: Using our domain knowledge, we carefully inspected and corrected falsely labeled images, ensuring that they were appropriately categorized. This step greatly enhances the accuracy of the dataset.\n- **Image Resizing:** All images in the dataset were resized to a memory-efficient yet academically accepted size of (224, 224), facilitating easier processing and analysis.\n**Statistics:**\n*Before the cleaning pipeline, the dataset contained the following number of samples for each class from the initial data source:\n- Normal: 500\n- Glioma: 926\n- Meningioma: 937\n- Pituitary: 901\n\nAfter applying the data cleaning pipeline, the number of samples in each category decreased on average by approximately **3-9%**. This reduction ensures the data integrity while maintaining a sufficient number of samples for comprehensive analysis.\n\n### Data Augmentation:\nTo enhance the diversity and robustness of the dataset, we employed various image augmentation techniques. These techniques were applied to the images without altering the labels. Here is a summary of the augmentation methods used:\n- **Salt and Pepper Noise**: Introducing random noise by setting pixels to white or black based on a specified intensity.\n- **Histogram Equalization**: Applying histogram equalization to enhance the contrast and details in the images.\n- **Rotation**: Rotating the images clockwise or counterclockwise by a specified angle.\n- **Brightness Adjustment**: Modifying the brightness of the images by adding or subtracting intensity values.\n- **Horizontal and Vertical Flipping**: Flipping the images horizontally or vertically to create mirror images.\n\n### Use Cases and Potential Investigations:\nThis dataset offers significant potential for various advanced medical research and analysis applications. Some interesting use cases and potential investigations using this dataset include:\n- **Tumor Classification**: Developing advanced machine learning models for accurate and automated brain tumor classification.\n- **Treatment Planning**: Analyzing the tumor characteristics to aid in treatment planning and decision-making processes.\n- **Radiomics Analysis**: Extracting quantitative features from the images for radiomics analysis to uncover valuable insights and patterns.\n- **Comparative Studies**: Conducting comparative studies among different tumor types to understand their unique characteristics and behaviors.\n\n### Acknowledgement\n- We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the original dataset publisher, **[sartajbhuvaji](https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji)**, for their valuable contribution.\n- This dataset is released under the CC0 license, making it open and accessible for everyone to use. While not mandatory, citing the dataset would be greatly appreciated.\n\n##### Important Note\nThose researchers who want to use this dataset for real world use cases, must consult with medical field experts (radiologists, ...) on the ground truth of the labels and their usability for their angle of research.",
