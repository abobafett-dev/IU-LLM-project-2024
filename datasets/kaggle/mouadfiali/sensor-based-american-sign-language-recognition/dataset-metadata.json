  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset features detailed sensor data from smart gloves designed to translate sign language into spoken language. The gloves were equipped with **5 flex sensors** and a \"**[Grove - 6 - Axis Accelerometer & Gyroscope](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-6-Axis_AccelerometerAndGyroscope/)**\" for each hand. The dataset consists of different files, each recorded by a different individual, showcasing a variety of hand movements and signs. Key features include:\n**- `Flex-Left/Right-p-Frame-n` :** Measures the degree of flexion for each finger over 20 frames, with 'n' indicating the frame and 'p' the finger number.\n**- `Acceleration-X/Y/Z-Left/Right-Frame-n` :** Captures the hand's acceleration in 3D space across 20 frames.\n**- `Orientation-X/Y/Z-Left/Right-Frame-n` :** Details the hand's orientation in 3D space for each frame.\n So for each hand, there are 3 types of measurements (Flex, Acceleration, Orientation), each with 3 axes (X, Y, Z) for Acceleration and Orientation, and 5 measurements for Flex (one per finger), resulting in 11 measurements per hand per frame. Multiplied by 20 frames, and then doubled for both hands, this amounts to **440 columns**. Additionally, there's a **\"SIGN\" column**, which is the target for each data entry, identifying the specific sign language gesture.\n\nEach recording in the dataset represents a sequence of 20 frames, capturing detailed motion for both left and right hands.\n\n**This dataset is not yet complete and is still being collected.**",
