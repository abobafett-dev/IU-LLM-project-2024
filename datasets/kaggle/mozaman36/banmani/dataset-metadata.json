However, no work in Bengali yet addresses the identification of specific claims in social media news that falsely manipulates a related news article. At this point, this problem has been tackled in English and a few other languages, but not in the Bengali language. In this paper, we curate a dataset of social media content labeled with information manipulation relative to reference articles, called BanMANI. The dataset collection method we describe works around the limitations of the available NLP tools in Bangla. We expect these techniques will carry over to building similar datasets in other low-resource languages. BanMANI forms the basis both for evaluating the capabilities of existing NLP systems and for training or fine-tuning new models specifically on this task. In our analysis, we find that this task challenges current LLMs both under zero-shot (ChatGPT) and fine-tuned (GPT-3) settings.\n\n**Bibtex for citation**\n\n@inproceedings{kamruzzaman-etal-2023-banmani,\n    title = \"{B}an{MANI}: A Dataset to Identify Manipulated Social Media News in {B}angla\",\n    author = \"Kamruzzaman, Mahammed  and\n      Shovon, Md.
