Lion, Elephant, Cheetah and Rhinoceros.\nI was inspired to create this dataset because I was going to do a project on Image Detection on the four animals but it was so hard to find them and I didn't want people to face the same problem, so I created it.\nI used three datasets I found on kaggle to extract what I wanted to create this.\nThose three datasets are:\n1. African Wildlife\n2. Animals Detection Images\n3. Wild Animals Images \n\nI want to thank the authors of these datasets for the big help. I wouldn't have done it without their hard work and contributions\n\nIF you liked it please UPVOTE",
