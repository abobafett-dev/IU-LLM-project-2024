This works best where the population to be insured is diverse and large. In Africa, formal insurance against risk has been hampered by lack of private sector companies offering insurance, with no way to diversify and pool risk across populations.\n\nUnderstanding the varied insurance needs of a population, and matching them to appropriate products offered by insurance companies, makes insurance more effective and makes insurance companies more successful.\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe error metric for this competition is the **log loss**. For every customer ID in the test set, for each product code, you must submit a prediction between 0 and 1 for likelihood that that customer has that product.\n\n### Data\n\nIn Train, there is a 1 in the relevant column for each product that a customer has. Test is similar, except that for each customer ONE product has been removed (the 1 replaced with a 0). Your goal is to build a model to predict the missing product.",
