Each class has `750` training images and `250` test images.\n\nThis dataset is a subset of `Food-101`. It contains `150` training images and `50` validation images for 10 easily classified foods: `apple pie, bibimbap, cannoli, edamame, falafel, french toast, ice cream, ramen, sushi, and tiramisu`. \n\nThe original purpose of this dataset was to speed development and prototyping of an image classifier on the full `Food-101` dataset and was used to experiment with a variety of techniques, including progressive resizing, label smoothing, and mixup. Training times should be under 30 seconds per epoch when using an image size of `224` or `256` and under a minute when using the max image size `512`. We hope it will help anyone who's looking to quickly test out new ideas for improving performance on the original `Food-101` dataset.\n",
