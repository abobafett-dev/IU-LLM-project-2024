Coins seem to be a major type of cash that are exchanged in these machines. The current methods of identifying the denomination of coins by the these machines commonly involves measuring the weight, size, and thickness of the coin using techniques such as light sensing, and detecting weather the coin is real or fake involves obtaining the composition of the coin to detect if it is metallic or not using techniques such as electromagnetic field transmission. These methods do work, except there are two problems:\n1. In many countries (like India), the versions of coins keep changing overtime and consequently the dimensions and compositions of the coins change too making it difficult to identify and detect coins using the afore mentioned methods.\n2. Fake coins can be made of metallic plates that resemble the size and composition of real coins, when such plates are inserted into the machine, they might get falsely detect as valid coins. \n\nOne potential way to solve these problems would be to use Machine Learning to identify the coin denomination and detect it's validity. But how? An ML model can be trained on a dataset of images of both real and fake coins of various denominations. If the images were captured with a flash, the amount of light reflected off of the surface of metallic coins would be higher compared to that of non-metallic fake coins. Also the higher reflection from metallic surface would produce regions of bright spots only in images of metallic coins.\n\nThe figure below shows some images captured with flash, taken from the dataset, showing some differences present between the images of real and fake coins.\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F12921587%2F5bf4e9119046d51e7c9258eada047ae0%2FRealVsFakeCoins.jpg?generation=1683396232330130&alt=media)\n(a) & (b) are images of a real coin, showing reflected light as bright spots on the coin.\n(c) is the image of a fake non-metallic coin, not showing any apparent bright spots of light.\n(d) is fake too but is a metallic plate and thus showing spots of brightness, but lacks the presence of imprints of denomination, the rupee symbol and artistry.\n(e) is fake, made by printing the image of a real coin on a piece of paper and pasted on a plastic plate, and thus the image contains both the spots of brightness and the information and artistry similar to that of a real coin but lacks the lustrous appearance of a real coin. Also the paper surface appears rougher compared to a real coin.\n\nKeeping in mind these differences, this dataset was created with 1750 images of various real and fake coins captured with flash and the images are classified into:\n1. The front face of real/valid Indian coins consisting the imprint of common denominations-\nRs 1, Rs 2, and Rs 5.\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F12921587%2F3cbee0087a974d872ff3684709e9ad2d%2Freal_coins_front.png?generation=1683302664681760&alt=media)\nThe images of front face of 1 rupee coins are contained in the folder named '1_rupee', images of 2 rupees in folder named '2_rupee' and 5 rupees in '5_rupee'.\n\n2.

The code for processing and the steps involved in the processing are described in detail in this Github repo.\n\nThus a model trained on this dataset potentially can:\n1. Classify coin denominations based on the features present in the coin images such as the denomination value and designs imprinted on the face of the coin.\n2.
