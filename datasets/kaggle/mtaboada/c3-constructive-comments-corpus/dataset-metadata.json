Unfortunately, online commenting platforms are often used as a place to vent anger, frustration, and express hatred, in general or towards specific groups. While there is a clear value in including reader comments, news organizations find themselves having to sift through and organize comments to ensure that commenters exchange views, opinions, and insights in a respectful and constructive manner, and to keep the discussion relevant to the issues discussed in the article. The goal of this project is to promote meaningful and constructive discussion online. Accordingly, we have developed computational methods to identify constructive comments.\n\nThe data for this project is a subset of comments from the SFU Opinion and Comments Corpus. This subset, the Constructive Comments Corpus (C3) consists of 12,000 comments annotated by crowdworkers for constructiveness and its characteristics.\n\n * SFU Opinion and Comments Corpus (unannotated): [https://github.com/sfu-discourse-lab/SOCC](https://github.com/sfu-discourse-lab/SOCC)\n * Constructive Comments Corpus, C3 (annotated):\n   * On Kaggle: Constructive Comments Corpus (C3)\n   * Citation: Kolhatkar, V., Thain, N., Sorensen, J., Dixon, L., Taboada, M., 2020.
