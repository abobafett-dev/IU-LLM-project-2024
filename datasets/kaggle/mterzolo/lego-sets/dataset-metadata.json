What about, how these features might interact with each other? I wanted to answer some of these questions and more, so I scraped lego set and price information from Lego's website.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set and there are features like how many pieces are in the set, how much the set sells for, etc. This dataset contains lego sets from all the different countries they sell online to (except South Korea).\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nSome other questions this dataset might help answer:\n\nWhat is the average suggested age for lego sets?\nDo electronics have a significant impact on the price of legos?\nAre more unique lego sets are sold in the U.S or in Spain?",
