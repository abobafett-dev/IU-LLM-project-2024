By collecting data directly from the field and the wind turbine installations, we aim to provide a comprehensive and authentic dataset that can be instrumental for industry-specific research, operational optimization, and academic purposes.\n\n**Data Collection:**\nData was meticulously gathered using state-of-the-art equipment installed at the site. The meteorological instruments measured temperature, humidity, dew point, and wind characteristics at different heights, while power generation data was recorded from the wind turbines' output.\nThis dataset is a unique compilation of field-based meteorological observations and wind power generation data, collected directly from one of our company's operational sites.
