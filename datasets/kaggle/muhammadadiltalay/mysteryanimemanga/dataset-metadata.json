What kind of mystery/detective manga/anime series have the highest rating or fan following (fantasy, science fiction, slice of life)?\n2. Are there any similarities between popular series in terms of story (kinds of mysteries solved, methods used to solve the mysteries)?\n3. Does there exist a correlation between author/studio and manga/anime rating?\n4. Which series are popular in certain demographic audience (young/teen/old males/females)? Can we infer why from the synopsis?\n5.
