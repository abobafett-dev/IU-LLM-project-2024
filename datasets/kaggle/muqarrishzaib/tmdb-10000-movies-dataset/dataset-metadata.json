What movies tend to get higher vote counts and vote averages on TMDB? Building Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendation Engines.\n# Acknowledgments\nThis dataset was generated from The Movie Database API. This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.\nTheir API also provides access to data on many additional movies, actors and actresses, crew members, and TV shows.
