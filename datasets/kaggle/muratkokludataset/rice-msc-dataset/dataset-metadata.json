A total of 75 thousand pieces of rice grain were obtained, including 15 thousand pieces of each variety of rice. Pre-processing operations were applied to the images and made available for feature extraction. A total of 106 features were inferred from the images; 12 morphological features and 4 shape features obtained using morphological features and 90 color features obtained from five different color spaces (RGB, HSV, L*a*b*, YCbCr, XYZ). In addition, for the 106 features obtained, features were selected by ANOVA, X2 and Gain Ratio tests and useful features were determined. In all tests, out of 106 features, the 5 most effective and specific features were obtained roundness, compactness, shape factor 3, aspect ratio and eccentricity. The color features were listed in different order following these features.",
