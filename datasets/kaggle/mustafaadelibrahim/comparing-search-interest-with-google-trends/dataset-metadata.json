Another rich source of time series data is Google Trends, where you can freely download the search interest of terms and topics from as far back as 2004. This project dives into manipulating and visualizing Google Trends data to find unique insights.\n\nIn this project\u2019s guided variant, you will explore the search data underneath the Kardashian family's fame and make custom plots to find how the most famous Kardashian/Jenner sister has changed over time. In the unguided variant, you will analyze the worldwide search interest of five major internet browsers to calculate metrics such as rolling average and percentage change.\n\nI'm not a fan nor a hater of the Kardashians and Jenners. The polarizing family intrigues me. Why? Their marketing prowess. Say what you will about them and what they stand for, they are great at the hype game. Everything they touch turns into the content.\nThe sister particularly over the past decade has been especially productive in this regard. Let's get some facts straight. I consider the \"sisters\" to be the following daughters of Kris Jenner. Three from her first marriage to lawyer Robert Kardashian:\n\n[Kourtney Kardashian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kourtney_Kardashian) daughter of Robert Kardashian, born in 1979) [Kim Kardashian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian) (daughter of Robert Kardashian, born in 1980) [Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khlo%C3%A9_Kardashian) (daughter of Robert Kardashian, born in 1984) And two from her second marriage to Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete, Caitlyn Jenner (formerly Bruce):\n\n[Kendall Jenner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner) (daughter of Caitlyn Jenner, born in 1995) [Kylie Jenner] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner) (daughter of Caitlyn Jenner, born in 1997) (Kardashian)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Jenner].\nWe're here to explore the data underneath the hype, and we'll do it using search interest data from Google Trends. We'll recreate the Google Trends plot to visualize their ups and downs over time, then make a few custom plots of our own. And we'll answer the big question: Is Kim even the most famous sister anymore?\n\n## Inspiration.\nI have used this dataset from the Google Trends website to develop my skills in time series analysis and to manipulate and plot time series data to analyze changes in search interest over time.",
