X-ray samples of COVID-19 were retrieved from different sources for the unavailability of a large specific dataset.\nFirst, 613 X-ray images of COVID-19 cases were collected from the following websites: GitHub, Radiopaedia, The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), and the Italian Society of Radiology (SIRM). Then, instead of data being independently augmented, a dataset containing 912 already augmented images was collected from Mendeley. Finally, 1525 images of pneumonia cases and 1525 X-ray images of normal cases were collected from the Kaggle repository and NIH dataset. A total of 4575 samples were used in the experiment, where 1525 samples were used for each case.\n\n[Asraf, Amanullah; Islam, Zabirul (2021), \u201cCOVID19, Pneumonia and Normal Chest X-ray PA Dataset\u201d, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/jctsfj2sfn.1](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jctsfj2sfn/1)",
