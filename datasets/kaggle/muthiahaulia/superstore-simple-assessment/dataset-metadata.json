This dataset contains order data from store that provide various product such as furniture, office supplies, and technology. The store keep information from each order, there are order id, order date, customer information, product information, and sales and profit from each order.\nI got it from an online course I took, I upload it here for my own record.\nI hope I continue learning!\n\nTask to do with this dataset:\n1. Which order and customer id that has the most sales?\n2. What are sub-categories in the 'Office Supplies' product category? and how much is the total profit for each sub-category?\n3. How many orders result in losses?\n4. Among these 3 customer id, JE-16165, KH-16510, AD-10180, which one has the most total sales?\n5. Create a new dataframe named \"yearly_sales\" contains total sales, number of customers, and total profit for each year. Which year has the most profit?\n6. Make a scatter plot between sales and profit for 2014 and 2015. Differentiate the colors between each year.\n7. Create a bar chart for 10 customer that has the most total sales in 2015",
