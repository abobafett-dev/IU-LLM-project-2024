  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset is structured to facilitate the classification and analysis of various types of waste materials. It is organized into three primary subsets: test, train, and val, each containing images of different waste categories. The dataset can be used for training and validating machine learning models focused on waste identification and classification for recycling or environmental monitoring purposes. This dataset contains images taken by drones of waste materials on beach. The dataset is specifically structured for usage with Yolo V8 model.\n\nDataset Structure Subsets:\n--&gt; test\n--&gt; train\n--&gt; val\n\nEach subset contains images categorized into the following waste types:\n1. Glass\n2. Plastic Bottle/Takeaway Cup\n3. Retort Pouch\n4. Take-away Container\n5. Tin/Aluminium Cans\n\nImage Format and Naming Conventions :- \n\nImages are in JPEG format with names indicating their source video and frame number, making it easier to trace and verify the context of each image.\nExample: VID_20230723_101947_0036_MP4-0_jpg.rf.9d22e3308027a20ddc97aedf6d5ac997.jpg indicates a frame extracted from a video recorded on July 23, 2023, with specific identifiers for the frame and image file.\n\nThis dataset offers a comprehensive collection of labeled images crucial for developing effective machine learning models in the field of waste management and recycling.\n\nOriginal Source :- Roboflow\nNote :- These images are available as separate datasets on roboflow. I have only structured them properly for direct usage in Yolo v8 models.",
