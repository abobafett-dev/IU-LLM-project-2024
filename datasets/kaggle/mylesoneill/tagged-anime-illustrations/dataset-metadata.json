  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nThis is a dataset of richly tagged and labeled artwork depicting characters from Japanese anime. The data comes from two image boards, danbooru and moeimouto. This data can be used in an variety of different interesting ways, from classification to [generative modeling][1]. Please note that while all of the images in this dataset have been tagged as SFW (non-explicit), the websites these are from do not ban explicit or pornographic images and mislabeled images are possibly still in the dataset. \n\n----------\n\n### Danbooru2017: A large-scale crowdsourced and tagged anime illustration dataset\n\nThe first set of data comes from the imageboard Danbooru. The entire corpus of Danbooru images was scraped from the site with permission and was collected into a dataset. The zip files included here have the full metadata for these images as well as a subset of 300,000 of the images in normalized 512px x 512px form. Full information about this dataset is available here:\n\nhttps://www.gwern.net/Danbooru2017\n\n**From the article:**\n\n*Deep learning for computer revision relies on large annotated datasets. Classification/categorization has benefited from the creation of ImageNet, which classifies 1m photos into 1000 categories. But classification/categorization is a coarse description of an image which limits application of classifiers, and there is no comparably large dataset of images with many tags or labels which would allow learning and detecting much richer information about images. Such a dataset would ideally be &gt;1m images with at least 10 descriptive tags each which can be publicly distributed to all interested researchers, hobbyists, and organizations. There are currently no such public datasets, as ImageNet, Birds, Flowers, and MS COCO fall short either on image or tag count or restricted distribution. I suggest that the image -boorus be used. The image boorus are longstanding web databases which host large numbers of images which can be tagged or labeled with an arbitrary number of textual descriptions; they were developed for and are most popular among fans of anime, who provide detailed annotations.*\n\n*The best known booru, with a focus on quality, is Danbooru. We create & provide a torrent which contains ~1.9tb of 2.94m images with 77.5m tag instances (of 333k defined tags, ~26.3/image) covering Danbooru from 24 May 2005 through 31 December 2017 (final ID: #2,973,532), providing the image files & a JSON export of the metadata. We also provide a smaller torrent of SFW images downscaled to 512x512px JPG (241GB; 2,232,462 images) for convenience.*\n\n*Our hope is that a Danbooru2017 dataset can be used for rich large-scale classification/tagging & learned embeddings, test out the transferability of existing computer vision techniques (primarily developed using photographs) to illustration/anime-style images, provide an archival backup for the Danbooru community, feed back metadata improvements & corrections, and serve as a testbed for advanced techniques such as conditional image generation or style transfer.*\n\n----------\n\n### Anime face character dataset\n\nThe second set of data included in this dataset is a little more manageable than the first, it includes a number of cropped illustrated faces from the now defunct site moeimouto. This dataset has been used in [GAN work][2] in the past. The data comes from: \n\nhttp://www.nurs.or.jp/~nagadomi/animeface-character-dataset/\n\nMore information:\n\nhttp://www.nurs.or.jp/~nagadomi/animeface-character-dataset/README.html\n\nIf you are interested in creating more face data (potentially from the Danbooru data), here is a helpful resource: https://github.com/nagadomi/lbpcascade_animeface\n\n----------\n\n### Other Data\n\nIf you are looking for something a little easier to crack into, check out this other great anime image booru dataset:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/alamson/safebooru \n\n  [1]: https://github.com/forcecore/Keras-GAN-Animeface-Character\n  [2]: https://github.com/forcecore/Keras-GAN-Animeface-Character",
