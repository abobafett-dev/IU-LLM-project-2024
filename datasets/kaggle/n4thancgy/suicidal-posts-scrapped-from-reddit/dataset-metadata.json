Each entry in the dataset represents a post from the SuicideWatch subreddit, including various attributes such as the post's title, selftext (body of the post), author, number of comments, and the post's URL. A binary flag (is_suicide) is set to 1 for all entries, indicating the source subreddit's focus on suicide.\n\n**Dataset Contents:**\n- title: The title of the Reddit post.\n- selftext: The text content of the post. If the post is empty, the value is \"emptypost\".\n- author: The Reddit username of the post's author.\n- num_comments: The number of comments on the post at the time of scraping.\n- is_suicide: A binary flag indicating the post's association with suicidal content (1 for all entries in this dataset).\n- url: The direct URL to the Reddit post.\n\n**Purpose:**\nThe dataset is intended for academic and research purposes, aiming to aid in the study of linguistic patterns, sentiment analysis, and the general behavior of individuals expressing suicidal thoughts or tendencies online. It can be used to develop tools for early detection of mental health issues, understand community support structures, and enhance crisis intervention strategies.\n\n**Usage Guidelines:**\nResearchers and practitioners are encouraged to use this dataset responsibly, considering the sensitive nature of the content. It is crucial to anonymize any personal information and adhere to ethical guidelines when analyzing or publishing results derived from this data.",
