  "descriptionNullable": "Toxoplasmosis chorioretinitis is commonly diagnosed by an ophthalmologist through the evaluation of the fundus images of a patient. Early detection of these lesions may help to prevent blindness. In this article we present a data set of fundus images labeled into three categories: healthy eye, inactive and active chorioretinitis. The dataset was developed by three ophthalmologists with expertise in toxoplasmosis detection using fundus images. The dataset will be of great use to researchers working on ophthalmic image analysis using artificial intelligence techniques for the automatic detection of toxoplasmosis chorioretinitis.\n\n# Data Description\n## Raw Images\nThe folder named \"Data_Raw_6class_All\" contains the original fundus images captured at 2 hospital centers:\n1. Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas Medical Center: The period of time consumed to collect the fundus images was from 2018 to 2020. The dataset consists of 291 fundus images with a size of 2124 x 2056 pixels in JPG format.\n\n2.Ni\u00f1os de Acosta \u00d1\u00fa General Pediatric Hospital: Images were acquired in children under 18 years of age. The images were captured in the year 2021. The dataset consists of 121 fundus images with a size of 1536 x 1152 pixels in JPG format.\n\nThe images correspond to patients with suspected congenital toxoplasmosis infection. The fundus images are classified according to the following categories: Healthy and Diseased. Diseased in turn, can be classified into: i) Inactive only, ii) Active only and iii) Active/Inactive. The number of data in each class is shown in the following table:\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F4418512%2F72f950749f1b1f0be296e476a6a9752c%2Ftable.PNG?generation=1695835869882569&alt=media)\n\n## Processed Images\nThe folder named \"Data_Processed_Paper\" contains the processed images divided into only Healthy and Diseased Classes so that a binary classification can be performed. The \"Diseased\" class is formed by combining the 5 sub-divisions under it. After going through literature and rigorous benchmarking experimentation, [Alam et al.] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10975) has established a preprocessing pipeline that yields the best classification results. The preprocessing includes denoising/smoothening, normalization, contrast enhancement, illumination equalization, color space transformation etc. Implementation details can be found in the [paper]((https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10975)).
