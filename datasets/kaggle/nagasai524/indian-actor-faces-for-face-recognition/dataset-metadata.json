These images are extracted by cropping the faces from the base images using MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Neural Network), which is one of the state-of-the-art techniques for face detection. The images are arranged in 135 directories, where each directory name represents the actor's facial image present in it. The total number of images for each actor is not exactly equal, but it is almost equal. The dataset is created in such a way that it does not have a class imbalance problem.",
