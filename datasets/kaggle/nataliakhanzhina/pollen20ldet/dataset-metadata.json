  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\nFlenley et al. stated the problem of automatic pollen images recognition more than 50 years ago. It requires solving two tasks: detection and classification. Nowadays, both tasks can be successfully handled using computer vision (CV) methods. However, the main obstacle in these tasks solving is the absence of big open datasets for benchmarking. Existing open datasets for pollen classification task ([POLEN23E](https://academictorrents.com/details/ee51ec7708b35b023caba4230c871ae1fa254ab3), [POLLEN73S](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157044)) are quite small and represent different domains, thus, their merging is not straightforward. Moreover, there is no open pollen dataset annotated for the detection task.\n\nThus, here we present the largest open pollen dataset obtained from the bright-field microscope, including 20 plant species, 2413 images containing 7745 single pollen grains, annotated for the classification and detection tasks.\n\n### Content\n\nThe images in the dataset are obtained using lighting microscope Olympus BX51. Pollen is stained with Fuchsin. The dataset is made using the Olympus DP71 image viewing system. All the pollen species were collected from Perm Krai, Russia, but typical for Europe in common.\n\nThe dataset is related to two domains: allergenic-specific palynology and mellisopalynology. Hence, it contains 13 taxa of allergenic plants (willow, linden, alder, birch, nettle, pigweed, plantain, sorrel, grass, pine, maple, hazel, mugwort) and 8 taxa of honey plants (linden, buckwheat, clover, angelica wild, angelica garden, hill mustard, meadow pink, fireweed). \n\nThe allergenic dataset we call POLLEN13L-det. We set the baseline for the detection and recognition on this dataset, see the paper [link to be provided]. We achieved [96.3%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521008581) of average precision for the detection task and [98.34%](https://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/20900/metod_otklyucheniya_putey_po_raspisaniyu_na_osnove_semplirovaniya_montekarlo_i_nepreryvnoy_relaksacii_dlya_ocenki_epistemicheskoy_neopredelennosti_v_zadache_klassifikacii_pylcy_na_izobrazheniyah%C2%A0.htm) of F1 measure for the classification task.\n\n### Cite\nTo cite our dataset, please use Khanzhina, Natalia, et al. \"Combating data incompetence in pollen images detection and classification for pollinosis prevention.\" Computers in biology and medicine 140 (2022): 105064.\n\nor\n\n@article{khanzhina2022combating,\n  title={Combating data incompetence in pollen images detection and classification for pollinosis prevention},\n  author={Khanzhina, Natalia and Filchenkov, Andrey and Minaeva, Natalia and Novoselova, Larisa and Petukhov, Maxim and Kharisova, Irina and Pinaeva, Julia and Zamorin, Georgiy and Putin, Evgeny and Zamyatina, Elena and others},\n  journal={Computers in biology and medicine},\n  volume={140},\n  pages={105064},\n  year={2022},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset is collected with the great help of Larisa Novoselova, Irina Kharisova, Julia Pinaeva and Georgiy Zamorin.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nResearchers are welcome to solve the detection and classification tasks :) Although we set relatively high baseline scores on these tasks, there is still the room for improvement. For example, there are two species that belong to one genus - angelica wild and angelica garden - its shape is almost the same even to most of palynologists, which significantly complicates the recognition. \n\nMake pollen recognition great again!",
