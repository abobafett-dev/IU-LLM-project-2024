Each picture has a corresponding TXT file containing bounding box labels for each type of animal in each image, all created in [makesense.ai](https://www.makesense.ai/) by yours truly. XML files were included in a previous version.\n\nThe data is split into a training dataset and a testing dataset. The training dataset contains 100 randomly selected images of each type of pet, with 1,000 images total. The testing dataset only contains 20 images of each type of pet with 200 images total.
