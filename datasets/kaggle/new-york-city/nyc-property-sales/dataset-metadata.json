A reference on the trickier fields:\n\n* `BOROUGH`: A digit code for the borough the property is located in; in order these are Manhattan (1), Bronx (2), Brooklyn (3), Queens (4), and Staten Island (5).\n* `BLOCK`; `LOT`: The combination of borough, block, and lot forms a unique key for property in New York City. Commonly called a `BBL`.\n* `BUILDING CLASS AT PRESENT` and `BUILDING CLASS AT TIME OF SALE`: The type of building at various points in time. See the glossary linked to below.\n\nFor further reference on individual fields see the [Glossary of Terms](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/finance/downloads/pdf/07pdf/glossary_rsf071607.pdf). For the building classification codes see the [Building Classifications Glossary](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/finance/jump/hlpbldgcode.html).\n\nNote that because this is a financial transaction dataset, there are some points that need to be kept in mind:\n\n* Many sales occur with a nonsensically small dollar amount: $0 most commonly. These sales are actually transfers of deeds between parties: for example, parents transferring ownership to their home to a child after moving out for retirement.\n* This dataset uses the financial definition of a building/building unit, for tax purposes. In case a single entity owns the building in question, a sale covers the value of the entire building. In case a building is owned piecemeal by its residents (a condominium), a sale refers to a single apartment (or group of apartments) owned by some individual.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset is a concatenated and slightly cleaned-up version of the New York City Department of Finance's [Rolling Sales dataset](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-rolling-sales-data.page).\n\n### Inspiration\n\nWhat can you discover about New York City real estate by looking at a year's worth of raw transaction records? Can you spot trends in the market, or build a model that predicts sale value in the future?",
