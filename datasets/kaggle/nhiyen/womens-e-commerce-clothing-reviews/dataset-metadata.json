  "descriptionNullable": "This is a dataset related to Women's Clothing E-Commerce and is centered around customer reviews. The dataset contains nine features that can be used to analyze the text from various angles. The data has been anonymized as it comes from real commercial sources, and any reference to the company in the review has been replaced with \"retailer\". \n\nThis dataset contains 23486 rows and 10 feature variables. Each row represents a customer review and includes the following variables:\n- Clothing ID: An integer categorical variable indicating the specific piece of clothing being reviewed.\n- Age: A positive integer variable indicating the age of the reviewer.\n- Title: A string variable indicating the title of the review.\n- Review Text: A string variable indicating the body of the review.\n- Rating: A positive ordinal integer variable indicating the product score given by the customer on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best).\n- Recommended IND: A binary variable indicating whether the customer recommends the product, with 1 indicating a recommendation and 0 indicating otherwise.\n- Positive Feedback Count: A positive integer variable indicating the number of other customers who found the review positive.\n- Division Name: A categorical name indicating the high-level product division.\n- Department Name: A categorical name indicating the product department.\n- Class Name: A categorical name indicating the product class.\n\nThe variables include Clothing ID, Age, Title, Review Text, Rating, Recommended IND, Positive Feedback Count, Division Name, Department Name, and Class Name. The data source is anonymous but genuine. This dataset is ideal for NLP analysis, feature engineering, and multivariate analysis.
