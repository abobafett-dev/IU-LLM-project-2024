Its nine supportive features offer a great environment to parse out the text through its multiple dimensions.

Each row corresponds to a customer review, and includes the variables:\n\n - **Clothing ID:** Integer Categorical variable that refers to the specific piece being reviewed. \n - **Age:** Positive Integer variable of the reviewers age.\n - **Title:** String variable for the title of the review.\n - **Review Text:** String variable for the review body. \n - **Rating:** Positive Ordinal Integer variable for the product score granted by the customer from 1 Worst, to 5 Best. \n - **Recommended IND:** Binary variable stating where the customer recommends the    product where 1 is recommended, 0 is not recommended.    \n - **Positive Feedback Count:** Positive Integer documenting the number of other customers who found this review positive.\n - **Division Name:** Categorical name of the product high level division.\n - **Department Name:** Categorical name of the product department name.\n - **Class Name:** Categorical name of the product class name.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nAnonymous but real source\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI look forward to come quality NLP!
