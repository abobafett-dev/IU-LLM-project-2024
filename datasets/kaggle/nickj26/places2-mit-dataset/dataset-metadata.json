The dataset features 5000 to 30,000 training images per class, consistent with real-world frequencies of occurrence. \nThere are 1.8 million train images from 365 scene categories in the Places365-Standard, which are used to train the Places365 CNNs. There are 50 images per category in the validation set.\n\nThese images are 256x256 images, in a more friendly directory structure that in Train and Val split the images are organized such as \n rain/reception/00003724.jpg and val/raft/000050000.jpg.
