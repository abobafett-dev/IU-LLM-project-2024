Special thanks to Simran, Manav Shah, Saurabh Hulyal, Nishant, Agrja Rastogi, and Kaustav Sarkar. We trained an emotion classification model with it, which was a part of our project.\n\n\n### Categories\n\nThe dataset has 3 categories namely Neutral, Interested, and Disappointed. Images under the folder belong to that category.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nMassive thanks to the FER-2013 dataset as most of the images are from there. We cleaned the dataset and used it along with hand annotating images Manav and Simran scraped. \n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nWe trained our first model on the FER-2013 dataset and many of the images were mislabeled. This limited the accuracy we could achieve. To counter this we decided to make our own version of the dataset.",
