One of the primary objectives of companies with financial loan services is to decrease payment defaults and ensure that individuals are paying back their loans as expected. In order to do this efficiently and systematically, many companies employ machine learning to predict which individuals are at the highest risk of defaulting on their loans, so that proper interventions can be effectively deployed to the right audience.\n\n## Description\n&gt; This dataset has been taken from Coursera's [Loan Default Prediction Challenge](https://www.coursera.org/projects/data-science-coding-challenge-loan-default-prediction) and will provide you the opportunity to tackle one of the most industry-relevant machine learning problems with a unique dataset that will put your modeling skills to the test.
