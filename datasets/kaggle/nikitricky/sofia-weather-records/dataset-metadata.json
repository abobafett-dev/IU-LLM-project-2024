  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset provides a detailed record of hour-by-hour weather elements in Sofia, Bulgaria, spanning from January 1, 2013, to January 1, 2023. The data is sourced from [The Norwegian Meteorological Institute](https://www.met.no/).\n\nThe dataset consists of two CSV files: `records.csv` and `weather_elements.csv`.\n\n- `records.csv`:\n   This file contains a comprehensive list of 24 weather elements recorded hourly. These elements include parameters such as relative humidity, air temperature, and low-type cloud coverage. Each record corresponds to a specific timestamp, allowing for detailed analysis of the weather patterns and fluctuations over the given time period. It is worth noting that not all weather elements have hourly data available. In cases where data is missing, the corresponding value is represented as empty.\n- `weather_elements.csv`:\n   This file provides additional information about the weather elements featured in the \"records.csv\" file. It includes details such as the units of measurement and temporal resolution.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n- **Climate Analysis**: Researchers and climatologists can utilize this dataset to analyze Sofia's long-term weather patterns and climate trends. By examining various weather elements over the years, they can identify seasonal variations, anomalies, and potential climate change impacts.\n- **Weather Forecasting**: Meteorologists can leverage historical weather data to improve their forecasting models for Sofia. By studying past weather patterns and their correlation with different elements, they can enhance the accuracy of their predictions.\n- **Research and Education**: The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and students interested in weather science, climate studies, and related fields. It can investigate specific weather phenomena, validate models, and conduct educational exercises.\n- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Data scientists and analysts can explore the dataset to extract meaningful insights and visualize the weather records. This can involve creating visual representations, generating statistical summaries, or building predictive models based on the available weather elements.",
