  "descriptionNullable": "# KU-HAR: An Open Dataset for Human Activity Recognition (v 1.0)\n\nHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) refers to the capacity of machines to perceive human actions. This dataset contains information on 18 different activities collected from 90 participants (75 male and 15 female) using smartphone sensors (Accelerometer and Gyroscope). It has 1945 raw activity samples collected directly from the participants, and 20750 subsamples extracted from them.\n\n## Activities/ Classes\n\n0. Stand \u279e Standing still (1 min)\n1. Sit \u279e Sitting still (1 min) \n2. Talk-sit \u279e Talking with hand movements while sitting (1 min) \n3. Talk-stand \u279e Talking with hand movements while standing or walking(1 min) \n4. Stand-sit \u279e Repeatedly standing up and sitting down (5 times)\n5. Lay \u279e Laying still (1 min) \n6. Lay-stand \u279e Repeatedly standing up and laying down (5 times)\n7. Pick \u279e Picking up an object from the floor (10 times)\n8. Jump \u279e Jumping repeatedly (10 times)\n9. Push-up \u279e Performing full push-ups (5 times)\n10. Sit-up \u279e Performing sit-ups (5 times)\n11. Walk \u279e Walking 20 meters (\u224812 s)\n12. Walk-backward \u279e Walking backward for 20 meters (\u224820 s)\n13. Walk-circle \u279e Walking along a circular path (\u2248 20 s)\n14. Run \u279e Running 20 meters (\u22487 s)\n15. Stair-up \u279e Ascending on a set of stairs (\u22481 min)\n16. Stair-down \u279e Descending from a set of stairs (\u224850 s)\n17. Table-tennis \u279e Playing table tennis (1 min)\n\n## Contents of the .zip files\n\n1.Raw_ time_ domian_ data.zip \u279e Originally collected 1945 time-domain samples in separate .csv files. The arrangement of information in each .csv file is:\n\tColumn 1, 5 \u279e exact time (elapsed since the start) when the Accelerometer (col. 1) & Gyroscope (col. 5) output were recorded (in ms)\n\tCol. 2, 3, 4 \u279e Acceleration along X, Y, Z axes (in m/s^2)\n\tCol. 6, 7, 8 \u279e Rate of rotation around X, Y, Z axes (in rad/s)\n\n2.Trimmed_ interpolated_ raw_ data.zip \u279e Unnecessary parts of the samples were trimmed (only from the beginning and the end). The samples were interpolated to keep a constant sampling rate of 100 Hz. The arrangement of information is the same as above.\n\n3.Time_ domain_ subsamples.zip \u279e 20750 subsamples extracted from the 1945 collected samples provided in a single .csv file. Each of them contains 3 seconds of non-overlapping data of the corresponding activity. Arrangement of information:\n\tCol. 1\u2013300, 301\u2013600, 601\u2013900 \u279e Accelerometer X, Y, Z axes readings\n\tCol. 901\u20131200, 1201\u20131500, 1501\u20131800 \u279e Gyro X, Y, Z axes readings\n\tCol. 1801 \u279e Class ID (0 to 17, in the order mentioned above)\n\tCol. 1802 \u279e length of each channel data in the subsample\n\tCol. 1803 \u279e serial no. of the subsample\n\nGravity acceleration was omitted from the Accelerometer data, and no filter was applied to remove noise.
