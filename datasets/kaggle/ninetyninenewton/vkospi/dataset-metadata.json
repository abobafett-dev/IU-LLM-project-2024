To put it simple, KOSPI200 and VKOSPI is analogous to S&P500 and VIX in the US. \n    \n\nFor more info  \n[KOSPI200](http://global.krx.co.kr/contents/GLB/05/0502/0502030101/GLB0502030101.jsp?idxCd=1028#1be3686ec5cb98595cf6179ba66d7a8b=1)  \n[VKOSPI](http://global.krx.co.kr/contents/GLB/05/0502/0502030101/GLB0502030101.jsp?idxCd=1300#1be3686ec5cb98595cf6179ba66d7a8b=1)  \n\n## About the data\n\n- Each row represents a trading day.   **Note that trading days don't include the weekends and holidays.**   \n- ***For*** stands for ***Foreigners***, while ***Indiv*** stands for ***Individuals***.  \n-  ***Amount*** in the column names represents (Price)\\*(Quantity), while ***Quantity*** only represents the quantity.  \n- ***Call***, ***Put***, and ***Future*** represent ***Call option of KOSPI200***, ***Put option of KOSPI200***, and ***Future of KOSPI200*** respectively.  \n- ***Day\\_till\\_expiration*** refers to the days left untill the expiration day of options.

An options contract offers the buyer the opportunity to buy or sell\u2014depending on the type of contract they hold\u2014the underlying asset. Unlike futures, the holder is not required to buy or sell the asset if they choose not to.  \n-  Call options allow the holder to buy the asset at a stated price within a specific timeframe.  \n-  Put options allow the holder to sell the asset at a stated price within a specific timeframe.  \nEach option contract will have a specific expiration date by which the holder must exercise their option.  \n\n### **Volatility**   \nIn finance, volatility (symbol \u03c3) is the degree of variation of a trading price series over time, usually measured by the standard deviation of logarithmic returns.   \nHistoric volatility measures a time series of past market prices. Implied volatility looks forward in time, being derived from the market price of a market-traded derivative (in particular, an option).  \n\n### **Open Interest**\nOpen interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as options or futures that have not been settled for an asset.   \n\n### **P/C Ratio**\nThe put-call ratio is calculated by dividing the number of traded put options by the number of traded call options.   \n  \n  \nFor more info  \n\n[Options Definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp)  \n[Volatility Definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp)  \n[Open Interest Definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp)  \n[P/C Ratio Definition](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/putcallratio.asp)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
