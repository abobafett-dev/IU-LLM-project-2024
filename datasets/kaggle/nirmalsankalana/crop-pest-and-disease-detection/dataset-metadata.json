The main goal of AI in agriculture is to improve crop yield, control crop pests/diseases, and reduce costs. The agricultural sector in developing countries faces severe in the form of disease and pest infestation, the knowledge gap between farmers and technology, and a lack of storage facilities, among others. To help address some of these challenges, this work presents crop pests/disease datasets sourced from local farms in Ghana. The dataset is presented in two folds; the raw images which consist of 24,881 images ( 6,549-Cashew, 7,508-Cassava, 5,389-Maize, and 5,435-Tomato) categorised into 22 classes.\nSource: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bwh3zbpkpv/1\n",
