  "descriptionNullable": "# Hand Gesture Recognition Dataset\n\n## Overview\n\nThis dataset contains images for hand gesture recognition, supporting research and development in the field of human-computer interaction, particularly in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications.\n\n## Dataset Description\n\nThe dataset consists of hand images captured using a standard camera, with corresponding labels for hand gestures. The text input method is based on hand-gesture recognition using a trained neural network. The process involves hand segmentation, gesture recognition, and hand movement tracking using a convex hull algorithm.\n\n## License\n\nThis dataset is provided under the license of Nizamuddin and Nooruddin.
