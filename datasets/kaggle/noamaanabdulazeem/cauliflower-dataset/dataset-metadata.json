It also contains unique plant compounds that may reduce the risk of several diseases, including heart disease and cancer. Because of the early disease spread in cauliflower, the farmer cannot produce high yield and face economic loss. In the recent era, image classification and detection is crucial application of Computer Vision. \nThree types of diseases, namely downy mildew, black rot, and bacterial spot rot, exist in every file. Besides, the disease free image of a cauliflower is also included.  \nA total of six hundred and fifty six images (656) are collected from the farmland contained in the original image file.\nThis dataset has been acquired from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/t5sssfgn2v/3",
