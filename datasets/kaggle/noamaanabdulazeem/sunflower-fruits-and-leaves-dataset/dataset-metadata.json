Three types of diseases, namely downy mildew, leaf scars, and Gray Mold, exist in every file. Besides, the fresh leaves image of a sunflower is also included. Because of the early disease recognition of sunflower, the farmer cannot produce high yield and face economic loss.\nA total of four hundred and sixty-seven images (467) are collected from the sunflower garden contained in the original image file. \nThis dataset has been acquired from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/b83hmrzth8/1",
