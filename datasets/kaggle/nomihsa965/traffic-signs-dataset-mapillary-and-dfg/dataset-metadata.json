This file is used for training YOLOv5.\n3. crops: This directory contains the crops of all instances of all classes organized by class name.\n4. images: This directory contains all images of the dataset.\n5. xmls: This directory contains annotations in xml format.\n6. txtx (YOLO): This directory contains annotations in YOLO txt format.\n\n\nTODO: There are still some signs which have not been annotated in the dataset e.g. large information/guide signs occurring on freeways.
