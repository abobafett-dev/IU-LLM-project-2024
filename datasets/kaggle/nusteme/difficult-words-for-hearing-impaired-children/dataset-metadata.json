  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nThis dataset is used as a result and part of research for identification of difficult English words for assisting hearing impaired children in learning language. \nAnything that is made by the combination of characters, words, sentences, and paragraphs is considered as text. Sentences are made by the combination of complex, simple words or both. Usage of more complex words in the text makes it a difficult one which causes problems not only in reading but in writing as well. This ultimately results in poor academic achievement of students. It is more difficult for hearing impaired children to learn and understand the difficult text as compared to their normal hearing peers. This happens because they lack increase knowledge of vocabulary. Speech language Pathologist/Therapist, their teachers and parents indulge them in different learning activities to increase their vocabulary. During this, they usually used flash cards, containing different words, pictures, printed papers, real objects and toys. But if presented words are difficult for them to learn, then it will be very difficult for others to develop understanding of the word in child\u2019s mental lexicon. This will also require a lot of effort and time not only from SLP\u2019s, parents, and teachers but also from hearing impaired students. Research will help in identification of difficult words to make the readability of the text easy for such children. It will help child to use simple words in daily routine to enhance their vocabulary knowledge as they can learn more words in short period of time. It will also help their parents and teachers to prepare reading and writing materials simpler to learn for them .It will help the child to learn language in simple way.In Pakistan, Educational institutes specific for hearing impaired children, adults, children, parents and Speech Language Pathologists (SLP\u2019s) can effectively make use of the proposed methodology in daily routine to identify difficult text from the study materials, newspapers, online on web stores and can prepare activities during speech therapy. It will save time and resources currently utilized manually. It will also enhance child\u2019s vocabulary as they can learn simple words rather than focusing and spending hours on difficult ones.\n\n\n\n### Content\n\nCollection of the dataset for this research is not a simple task.  Dataset  is collected from the English textbooks and online sources  being taught at elementary and secondary level at schools established specifically for hearing impaired children. Unstructured data is annotated and then preprocessed. The main objective for this is to ensure an accurate generation of linguistic rules that helps to label a particular word as difficult or not difficult. Data is then annotated by experts. Word is annotated as difficult if 2 or more annotators have annotated it as difficult. It consist of 1000 words which is divided into two sets. one set is used for training purpose and is constitue of 600 words, whereas , remaining 400 words are used for testing purpose. \nDifferent features are then extracted based on rules applicable and specific to hearing impaired children.\nCharacter count / Word Length:\tMaximum the number of characters found in the word, Word is difficult\nSyllable Count:\tMore the number of syllable count more will be the chance of word to be considered as difficult.\nPart of Speech Tags:\tNouns are easier to learn as compared to verbs and adjective; whereas adverbs are difficult as they describe the abstract idea. Hearing Impaired children learn concrete words easily than abstract words.\nPresence of ch/st/th/f/sh in words:\tCh /st/th/f/sh produce high-frequency sounds during pronunciation and considered as high-frequency letters. So their presence makes the word difficult to understand for hearing impaired children\nPresence of C or K in words:\tSometimes pronunciation of c and k are the same or different in context. So it is difficult for the child to recognize during reading or writing, what to read.\nPresence of G or J in words\t:Sometimes pronunciation of g and j are the same or different in context. So it is difficult for the child to recognize during reading or writing, what to read.\nFrequency of occurrence:\tIf a word appears more frequently, then the word is easy otherwise difficult.\n\n\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to all the efforts made and help provided by the teachers from the hearing impaired children during creation of this dataset.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nYour data will be in front of the world's largest data science community. What questions do you want to see answered?",
