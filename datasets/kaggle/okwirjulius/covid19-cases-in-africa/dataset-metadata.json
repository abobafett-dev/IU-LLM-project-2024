This later turned out to be the **novel coronavirus disease** (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by **severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2** (SARS-CoV-2) of the coronavirus family. The disease causes respiratory illness characterized by [primary symptoms ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) like cough, fever, and in more acute cases, difficulty in breathing. **WHO** later [declared COVID-19 as a Pandemic](https://time.com/5791661/who-coronavirus-pandemic-declaration/) because of its fast rate of spread across the Globe. \n\n### Content\nThe COVID-19  datasets organized by continent contain daily level information about the COVID-19 cases in the different continents of the world.  It is a time-series data and **the number of cases on any given day is cumulative**. The original datasets can be found on this [John Hopkins University Github repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). I will be updating the COVID-19 datasets on a regular basis with every update from John Hopkins University. I have also included the World COVID-19 tests data [scraped](https://github.com/ju-ok/Covid-19-cases-by-Continent/blob/master/covid19_tests.R) from [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) and 2020 world population also [scraped](https://github.com/ju-ok/Covid-19-cases-by-Continent/blob/master/world_population(2020).R) from [worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/). \n\n### The datasets\n**COVID-19 cases**\n`covid19_world.csv`.
