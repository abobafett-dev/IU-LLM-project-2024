  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset is a collection of 21000 Amazon product reviews, meticulously divided into 5 different rating scales (1-5). The data is collected from various product categories and provides a rich source for text analysis, natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and machine learning algorithm testing.\n\nThe dataset is structured with five separate folders, each representing a different rating scale. Each folder consists of 4200 text files containing an individual review. Hence, you will find 4200 reviews each for scores 1 through 5.\n\n**Contents**\nEach text file contains a single Amazon product review, ranging from a rating of 1 to 5. The files are distributed across five folders named as follows: \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", and \"5\". Each folder contains 4200 reviews, which are anonymous, in English, and vary in length.\n\n**Format**\nFolder \"1\": 4200 text files with reviews scoring 1\nFolder \"2\": 4200 text files with reviews scoring 2\nFolder \"3\": 4200 text files with reviews scoring 3\nFolder \"4\": 4200 text files with reviews scoring 4\nFolder \"5\": 4200 text files with reviews scoring 5\nThe filename of each text file is a number (1-4200).txt.\n\n**Usage**\nThis dataset can be used to train sentiment analysis models, for product review classification, to train recommendation systems, or for natural language processing tasks. It also offers a great resource for conducting exploratory data analysis to understand the key features of a good or bad review, as well as to investigate possible bias in reviews and ratings.\n\nPlease note that this data should be used for educational and research purposes only.
