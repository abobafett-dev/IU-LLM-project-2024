Photo files are in the .png format and the labels are integers and values.\n\nThe file DecorColorImages.h5 consists of preprocessing images of this set: image tensors and targets (labels).\n\n# Acknowledgments\nI have published the data for absolutely free usage by any site visitor. But this database contains the names of famous traditional decor styles, so it can not be used for commercial purposes.\n\n# Usage\nClassification, image recognition or generation, colorizing, etc. in a c case of a small number of images are useful exercises. There are three kinds of classification here: by country, by pattern, by types of image (pattern itself or product).\n\n# Improvement\nIt's possible to find lots of ways for improving this set and the machine learning algorithms applying to it because of many traditional patterns in the world.",
