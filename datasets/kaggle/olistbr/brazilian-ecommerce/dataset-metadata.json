  "descriptionNullable": "# Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist\n\nWelcome! This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at [Olist Store](http://www.olist.com). The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. We also released a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates.  \n\nThis is real commercial data, it has been anonymised, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses.\n\n## Join it With the Marketing Funnel by Olist\nWe have also released a [Marketing Funnel Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/marketing-funnel-olist/home).

Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract.
