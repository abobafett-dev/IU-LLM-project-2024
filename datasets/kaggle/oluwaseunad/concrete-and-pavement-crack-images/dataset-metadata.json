  "descriptionNullable": "**Title: Crack Detection in Concrete and Pavement using Convolutional Neural Networks**\n\n**Summary:** This dataset contains 30,000 images of concrete and pavement surfaces, classified into two categories: crack and non-crack. The images were obtained from the Nigerian Army University Biu in Borno state, Nigeria, and collected by Omoebamije Oluwaseun, a civil engineering student, for his final year project. The images were collected using a DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise drone (for the high-ups) and a smartphone (for the ones beneath the average window height). The dataset was saved in RGB, JPEG format and downsized to 227 x 227 pixels.\n\n**Content:** The dataset consists of two folders: \"positive\" and \"negative\", containing images of cracked and non-cracked concrete surfaces, respectively. Each image in the dataset is in JPEG format, with a resolution of 227 x 227 pixels in RGB format.\n\n**Usefulness:** This dataset can be used for training and testing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for crack detection in concrete. The dataset has been used by the author to achieve over 99% accuracy on his model, and it can be used for research purposes only. The author must be properly referenced if the dataset is used for any purpose.\n\n*Details:*\n\n*Source: Nigerian Army University Biu, Borno state, Nigeria*\n*Collector: Omoebamije Oluwaseun*\n*Format: RGB, JPEG*\n*Resolution: 227 x 227 pixels*\n*Classes: crack, non-crack*\n*Total images: 30,000*\n",
