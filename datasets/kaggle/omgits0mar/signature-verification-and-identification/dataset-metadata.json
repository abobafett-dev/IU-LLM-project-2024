Signature Identification : Building a classical vision or DL techniques to identify the person of this signature.\n&gt; 2. Signature Verification : Build a 5 different models to identify for each class if it is a real or fake OR build a 1 siamese network that verifies the signature of the person whether it is a real one or fake one.",
