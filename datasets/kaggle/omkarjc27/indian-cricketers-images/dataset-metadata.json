But the problem was, there were some players who did not have a lot of images which resulted in low accuracy of the model. So this dataset has a lot of images of just Indian cricketer's. \n\n### Content\n\nBelow are around 600 images of 15 top Indian cricket players (who have participated in the 2019 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup). There are 30-50 images per player.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI have scrapped all these images from google images using a selenium and beautiful-soup and cleaned them out, image by image. I am Sorry but I can't give credit to the owners. I am Sorry, Really Really SORRY.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nIt would be fun to find everyone's cricketer doppelganger.",
