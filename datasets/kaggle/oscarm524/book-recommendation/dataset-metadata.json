  "descriptionNullable": "#Backgorund\nBefore the pandemic, Johannes Gutenberg managed a flourishing little book shop in the historic city center of Mainz. He took great joy in building personal relationships with each of his clients, recommending books catered to their personal taste and assisting in widening their literary palette. In his city and beyond he developed a formidable reputation with a respectable base of loyal customers, who considered him more of a connoisseur than a traditional salesman.\n\nUnfortunately, this loyal base of customers is not enough to make his business profitable. And so, like many traditional retailers, Johannes also relies on walk-in customers.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, this source of revenue vanished. To keep his employees and cover ongoing costs, Johannes had to find an alternative form of revenue.\n\nWith great initial reservation, he decided to expand his business by launching an online shop, which he believed would save his beloved business from imminent bankruptcy.\n\nAt first, Johannes and his employees tried their best to provide suitable recommendations for every product manually. But as the number of products increased and associates worked to keep at least some personal contact to clients via phone and email, this manual process was just not feasible.\n\nToday, Johannes is looking for a reliable recommendation system to provide a targeted recommendation to every product page. This solution should meet his high personalization standards and only require a small amount of manual support to implement.\n\nIn order to create a recommender model, the participants are provided with historical transaction and descriptive item data in the form of structured text files (.csv)\n\n#Data\nThe data is provided in three individual files. One file containing the transactions (\u201ctransactions.csv\u201d) one the descriptive item data (\u201citems.csv\u201d) and the final one (\u201cevaluation.csv\u201d) containing the template for the result submission. Here are some points to note about the files:\n\n1. The first line (top line) has the same structure as the data sets but contains the names of the respective columns (data fields).\n\n2. A list of all the column names, which occur in the appropriate order, can be found in the \u201cfeatures.pdf\u201d file as well as brief descriptions and value ranges of the associated fields.\n\n3. The top row and each data set contain several fields, which are separated from each other by the \u201c|\u201d symbol.\n\n4. Floating point numbers are not rounded. \u201c.\u201d is used as the decimal separator.\n\n5. There is no escape character: quotes are not used.\n\n6. The encoding is \u201cutf-8\u201d.\n\nThe \u201citems.csv\u201d file is a master data set that contains descriptive features. The features may be categorical or numerical. The list of features is explained in the \u201cfeatures.pdf\u201d file. Each data line contains the description for one single item.\n\nThe \u201ctransactions.csv\u201d file contains information about clicks, baskets and orders over a period of three months. Each line displays one transaction for one single item. All the attributes are described in the \u201cfeatures.pdf\u201d file.\n\nThe \u201cevalutation.csv\u201d file contains a list of product IDs. This list is a subset of the products from the \u201citems.csv\u201d and the reference for the submission.\n\n#Task\nThe goal for each participating team is to create a recommendation model based on historical transactions and item features. For any given product, the model should return its five best recommendations. In order to create a recommender model, the participants are provided with historical transaction and descriptive item data in the form of structured text files (.csv).\n\n#Acknowledgements\nThis dataset is publicly available in [data-mining-cup-website](https://www.data-mining-cup.com/reviews/dmc-2021/).
