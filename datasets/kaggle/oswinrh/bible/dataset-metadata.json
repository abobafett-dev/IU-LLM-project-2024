  "descriptionNullable": "### Context \n\nBible (or Biblia in Greek) is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans ([Wiki][1]). And for data mining purpose, we could do many things using Bible scriptures as for NLP, Classification, Sentiment Analysis and other particular topics between Data Science and Theology perspective.\n\n### Content\n\nHere you will find the following bible versions in **sql, sqlite, xml, csv,** and **json** format:\n\n- American Standard-ASV1901 (ASV)\n\n- Bible in Basic English (BBE)\n\n- Darby English Bible (DARBY)\n\n- King James Version (KJV)\n\n- Webster's Bible (WBT)\n\n- World English Bible (WEB)\n\n- Young's Literal Translation (YLT)\n\nEach verse is accessed by a unique key, the combination of the BOOK+CHAPTER+VERSE id.\n\n**Example:**\n\n- Genesis 1:1 (Genesis chapter 1, verse 1) = 01001001 (01 001 001)\n\n- Exodus 2:3 (Exodus chapter 2, verse 3) = 02002003 (02 002 003)\n\n- The verse-id system is used for faster, simplified queries.\n\n- For instance: 01001001 - 02001005 would capture all verses between Genesis 1:1 through Exodus 1:5.\n\nWritten simply:\n \n`SELECT * FROM bible.t_asv WHERE id BETWEEN 01001001 AND 02001005`\n\n**Coordinating Tables**\n\nThere is also a number-to-book key (key_english table), a cross-reference list (cross_reference table), and a bible key containing meta information about the included translations (bible_version_key table). See below SQL table layout. These tables work together providing you a great basis for a bible-reading and cross-referencing app. In addition, each book is marked with a particular genre, mapping in the number-to-genre key (key_genre_english table) and common abbreviations for each book can be looked up in the abbreviations list (key_abbreviations_english table).\nWhile its expected that your programs would use the verse-id system, book #, chapter #, and verse # columns have been included in the bible versions tables.\n\n**A Valuable Cross-Reference Table**\n\nA very special and valuable addition to these databases is the extensive cross-reference table. It was created from the project at http://www.openbible.info/labs/cross-references/. See .txt version included from http://www.openbible.info website. Its extremely useful in bible study for discovering related scriptures. For any given verse, you simply query vid (verse id), and a list of rows will be returned. Each of those rows has a rank (r) for relevance, start-verse (sv), and end verse (ev) if there is one.\n\n**Basic Web Interaction**\n\nThe web folder contains two php files. Edit the first few lines of index.php to match your server's settings. Place these in a folder on your webserver.\nThe references search box can be multiple comma separated values. (i.e. John 3:16, Rom 3:23, 1 Jn 1:9, Romans 10:9-10) You can also directly link to a verse by altering the URI: [http://localhost/index.php?b=John 3:16, Rom 3:23, 1 Jn 1:9, Romans 10:9-10](http://localhost/index.php?b=John 3:16, Rom 3:23, 1 Jn 1:9, Romans 10:9-10)\n\n - bible-mysql.sql (MySQL) is the main database and most feature-oriented due to contributions from developers. It is suggested you use that for most things, or at least convert the information from it.\n - cross_references-mysql.sql (MySQL) is the cross-reference table. It has been separated to become an optional feature. This is converted from the project at http://www.openbible.info/labs/cross-references/.\n - bible-sqlite.db (SQLite) is a basic simplified database for simpler applications (includes cross-references too).\n - cross_references.txt is the source cross-reference file obtained from http://www.openbible.info/labs/cross-references/\n\nIn CSV folder, you will find (same list order with the other formats):\n\n - bible_version_key.csv\n\n![bible_version_key][2]\n\n - key_abbreviations_english.csv\n\n![key_abbreviations_english][3]\n\n - key_english.csv\n\n![key_english][4]\n\n - key_genre_english.csv\n\n![key_genre_english][5]\n\n - t_asv.csv, t_bbe.csv, t_dby.csv, t_wbt.csv, t_web.csv, t_ylt.csv\n\n![t_version][6]\n \n### Acknowledgements\n\nIn behalf of the original contributors ([Github][7])\n\n### Inspirations\n\n[WordNet][8] as an additional semantic resource for NLP\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible\n  [2]: http://i.imgur.com/S9JialN.png\n  [3]: http://i.imgur.com/v59SpQs.png\n  [4]: http://i.imgur.com/BbKMQgF.png\n  [5]: http://i.imgur.com/lJVVW2C.png\n  [6]: http://i.imgur.com/jJ4cf4q.png\n  [7]: https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases\n  [8]: https://wordnet.princeton.edu/",
