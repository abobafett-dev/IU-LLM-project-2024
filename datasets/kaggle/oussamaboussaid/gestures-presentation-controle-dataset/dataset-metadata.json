  "descriptionNullable": "The \"Gestures & Sign Presentation Control DataSet\" is a real dataset that was meticulously collected in collaboration with the FabLab Research Laboratory for the Hand Gestures Presentation Control Project. The primary objective of this dataset is to investigate the usage of hand gestures and sign language during presentations and to develop a gesture-based control system for presentation software. The dataset provides valuable insights into the patterns, effectiveness, and practical applications of gestures in improving communication during presentations.\nThe \"Gestures & Sign Presentation Control DataSet\" holds significant potential for research and practical applications. Researchers can leverage this dataset to explore the effectiveness of different gestures, identify cultural variations in sign language, and develop robust gesture recognition algorithms. Furthermore, the dataset serves as a foundational resource for the development of innovative presentation control systems, where presenters can interact with presentation software through natural hand gestures, enhancing engagement and interaction during presentations",
