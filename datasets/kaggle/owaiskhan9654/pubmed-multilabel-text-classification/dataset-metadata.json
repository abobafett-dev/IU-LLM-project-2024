Originally these documents are manually annotated by Biomedical Experts with their MeSH labels and each article are described in terms of 10-15 MeSH labels. In this Dataset we have huge numbers of labels present as a MeSH major, raising the issue of extremely large output space and severe label sparsity issues. To solve this issue, the Dataset has been Processed and mapped to its root as described below.\n![Mapped Image not Fetched](https://gitlab.com/Owaiskhan9654/Gene-Sequence-Primer/-/raw/main/Capture111.PNG)\n![Tree Structure](https://gitlab.com/Owaiskhan9654/Gene-Sequence-Primer/-/raw/main/Capture22.PNG)\n\n\n",
