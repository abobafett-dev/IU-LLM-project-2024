This dataset was scraped from [Car45.com](https://www.cars45.com/) by leveraging on Python and its powerful libraries, including Beautiful Soup and urllib3, to scrape valuable information from the websites. \n\nThe dataset contains at least 2000 records with 22 columns.\n\n**Scope**\n\nThe scope of the project encompassed identifying and scraping data from a car listing website, representing  different car model or a category. The scraped data included text descriptions and numeric specifications. I cleaned and structured the scraped data to ensure its usability for further analysis.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\nThe project resulted in a well-organized dataset containing a comprehensive collection of car information. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for conducting analyses such as price trends, feature comparisons, and sentiment analysis based on customer reviews. The scraped data can also be integrated into machine learning models for predictive analytics related to car pricing and customer preferences.\n\nAlso, the projects resulted to:\n\n* Providing an updated dataset on cars in nigeria compared to the last data updated 10 months ago.\n* providing a dataset containig 4000+ cars and their prices in Naira. The data contains 19 features such as car make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, price, etc.\n* providing a dataset that can be use for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning.",
