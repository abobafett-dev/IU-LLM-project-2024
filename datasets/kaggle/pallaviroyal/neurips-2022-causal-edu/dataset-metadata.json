We can break down topics into constructs, which are the smallest element of learning. For example \"Converting between cm and m\" is a construct within the topic \"Units of length\". Discovering the relationships between constructs can help the design of more efficient curricula.\nWe cannot measure student's construct knowledge directly, so we use answers to questions as a surrogate measure. A deceptively simple but powerful question type used to understand student learning is a diagnostic question. This is a multiple-choice question with four answers designed to assess a single construct. By inspecting the correctness to diagnostic questions from large number of students should reveal the hidden relationships behind different constructs (e.g. some constructs can be prerequisite for others), which can be leveraged to improve the students' knowledge acquisition.\n\n## Tasks\nDevelop solution to discover the causal relationships between different constructs and evaluate the impact of learning one construct on other constructs.\n- **Task 1** - Relationship discovery for constructs over time using synthetic time-series data.\n- **Task 2** - Teaching effectiveness inference using synthetic time-series data.\n\n## Impact\nThe real-world impact would be to provide an objective construct map which acts as an architecture of learning. This could be used in many educational contexts, for example to order topics within curricula or to direct students to prerequisites.\n\n## Dataset\n### Task_1_dataset\nContains 5 different datasets(train.csv) and adj_matrix.npy. For each dataset, it contains 100 students and 400 simulation time for each student. The total number of construct is 50. Thus, this will contain 40000 observations.\n**train.csv columns details**\nTotal 52 columns. \n- The first column, ***student_id***, specifies the student index. The rows with the same student_id forms a time series containing the learning path history. The first row of student_id represents the starting time of the learning path.\n- The second column, ***bot_action*** specifies the construct index the bot assigns to the student to learn at that time. The possible assignment is [0, . . . , number of construct \u2212 1]\n- The remaining columns, ***construct_**** is a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of correctly answering a multiple choice question related to that construct. \n**adj_matrix.npy**\nThe construct relations for each dataset are represented by the binary adjacency matrix. The size of the matrix is **num_construct \u00d7 num_construct**. Specifically, adj_matrix[i,j]= 1 represents construct_i is a prerequisite for construct_j, and 0 means there is no direct relation between them. adj_matrix.npy contains 5 such matrics for 5 diferent datset. **5 \u00d7 num_construct \u00d7 num_construct**.\n### Task_2_dataset\nContains intervention dataset for each task-1 dataset.\n### Instruction_and_Guide_Causal_Insights_for_Learning_Paths_in_Education.pdf\nDocuments helps to understand problem and dataset more.\n\n## Algorithms to start with\n- **VARLiNGAM** -  https://lingam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/var.html\n- **DECI** - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/deep-end-to-end-causal-inference/ \n\n## Sample Code to start with\n- https://github.com/microsoft/causica \n\n## Motivation\n- Understand causal inference techniques For Machine Learning problems \n- Discover casual graphs (causal relationships between variables) in datasets.
