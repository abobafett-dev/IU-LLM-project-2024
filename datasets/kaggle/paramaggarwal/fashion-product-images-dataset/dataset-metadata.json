In addition to professionally shot high resolution product images, we also have multiple label attributes describing the product which was manually entered while cataloging. To add to this, we also have descriptive text that comments on the product characteristics.\n\n### Content\n\nEach product is identified by an ID like 42431. You will find a map to all the products in `styles.csv`. From here, you can fetch the image for this product from `images/42431.jpg` and the complete metadata from `styles/42431.json`.\n\nTo get started easily, we also have exposed some of the key product categories and it's display name in `styles.csv`.\n \nIf this dataset is too large, you can start with a smaller (280MB) version here:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small\n\n### Inspiration\n\nSo what can you try building? Here are some suggestions:\n\n* Start with an image classifier. Use the `masterCategory` column from `styles.csv` and train a convolutional neural network.\n* The same can be achieved via NLP. Extract the product descriptions from `styles/42431.json` and then run a classifier to get the `masterCategory`.\n* Try adding more sophisticated classification by predicting the other category labels in `styles.csv`\n\nTransfer Learning is your friend and use it wisely. You can even take things much further from here:\n\n* Is it possible to build a GAN that takes a category as input and outputs an image?\n* Auto-encode the image attributes to be able to make a visual search engine that converts the image into a small encoding which is sent to the server to perform visual search?\n* Visual similarity search? Given an image, suggest other similar images.",
