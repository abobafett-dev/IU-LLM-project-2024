  "descriptionNullable": "Cryptocurrency enjoyed a prosperous year in 2021 as the asset class enjoyed record returns. In 2021, the crypto industry's total market capitalization grew by 187.5%, peaking at around US$3 trillion, with many of the top coins offering four-digit and even five-digit percentage returns. The value of Bitcoin peaked at almost US$65,000 in mid-April 2021 before falling to US$30,000 by June 2021. Today, over 20,000 different cryptocurrencies exist, with some having little to no following while others enjoy immense popularity, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nThe tide turned however as the year came to an end as many economies grappled with numerous macroeconomic headwinds. Financial markets were negatively impacted by these headwinds with both stocks and fixed-income assets struggling. Cryptocurrency would not be spared, leading crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum down as much as 50% in the first half of 2022. Market experts speculate that cryptocurrency may fall even lower by year-end 2022 given the uncertainty that has recently plagued the industry following the collapse of one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. \n\n***The Fall of FTX***\nPrior to November 2022, FTX was recognized as one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, gaining immense popularity during its short existence. The exchange was founded in 2019 with Sam Bankman-Fried co-founding and being the largest stakeholder in the company from inception. Mr Bankman-Fried also co-founded Alameda Research 2017, a quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm.   \nFTX enjoyed a meteoric rise, peaking in 2021 as the company\u2019s valuation reached US$32 billion. The exchange also issued its own cryptocurrency token called FTT. At its peak in 2021, the exchange had over 1 million users and was the third largest crypto exchange by volume with its token FTT reaching a market cap of $9.39 billion. In 2022, as crypto assets struggled, the FTX exchange stood as one of the brighter lights in the sector. As other cryptocurrency exchanges were challenged on many fronts including bankruptcy earlier in the year, the majority owner of FTX came to the rescue offering financial support to several companies including Robinhood and Voyager.  Sam Bankman-Fried would soon gain the nickname \u201cCrypto\u2019s White Knight\u201d.\nFTX's downfall began when CoinDesk, a news site specializing in bitcoin and digital currencies, released a statement on November 2 2022 revealing that Alameda Research Trading firm was heavily invested in FTT, FTX\u2019s own cryptocurrency, which represented around 40% of the trading firm\u2019s asset holdings. This news put Sam in the spotlight and sparked widespread selloffs in digital assets. The story exposed the depth and complexity of the relationship between FTX and Alameda Research, including that FTX was lending significant quantities of its own token FTT to the trading firm to build up the cash levels.\nAlthough the company attempted damage control through public reassurances to its customers, it failed to prevent customers from withdrawing their funds.  Four days later on November 6 2022, Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange announced their decision to sell their entire holdings of the FTT tokens worth approximately US$529 million.  Binance\u2019s decision to liquidate its position in FTT was based on a risk management strategy following the collapse of the Terra (LUNA) crypto token earlier in 2022. Subsequent to this announcement, withdrawal requests began to rise rapidly and two days later, FTX was faced with a liquidity crisis and stopped paying back customers. While a bail-out was initially offered by Binance, it was rescinded after the necessary due diligence. As a result, eight days after the story broke, on November 11 2022 the company, FTX filed for bankruptcy. ",
