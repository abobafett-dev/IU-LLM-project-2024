  "descriptionNullable": "The purpose of the World Press Freedom Index is to compare the level of press freedom enjoyed by\njournalists and media in 180 countries and territories. This comparison is based on a definition of press freedom formulated by RSF and its panel experts when developing the new methodology to be used from 2022 onwards.\n\u201cPress freedom is defined as the ability of journalists as individuals and collectives to select, produce, and disseminate news in the public interest independent of political, economic, legal, and social interference and in the absence of threats to their physical and mental safety.\u201d\nThe Index is a snapshot of the situation in the 180 countries and territories during the calendar year\n(January-December) prior to its publication. Nonetheless, it is meant to be seen as an accurate reflection of the situation at the time of publication.\nTherefore, when the press freedom situation changes dramatically in a country between the end of the year assessed and publication, the data is updated to take account of the most recent events possible. This may be related to a new war, a coup d'\u00e9tat, an unprecedented or very unusual major attack on journalists, or the sudden introduction of an extreme repressive policy. For the 2022 Index, this exceptional procedure was used with Russia, Ukraine and Mali.\n\n***What is the World Press Freedom Index?***\n*1. About:*\na. It has been published every year since 2002 by Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF) or Reporters Without Borders.\nb. Based in Paris, RSF is an independent NGO with consultative status with the United Nations, UNESCO, the Council of Europe and the International Organization of the Francophonie (OIF).\nc. The Index ranks countries and regions according to the level of freedom available to journalists. However, it is not an indicator of the quality of journalism.\n*2. Scoring Criteria:*\nThe Index\u2019s rankings are based on a score ranging from 0 to 100 that is assigned to each country or territory, with 100 being the best possible score (the highest possible level of press freedom) and 0 the worst.\n*3. Evaluation Criteria:*\nEach country or territory\u2019s score is evaluated using five contextual indicators: political context, legal framework, economic context, sociocultural context and safety.\n\n***What are the Highlights of the Performance of the World?***\n*1. About:*\nThe report reveals a two-fold increase in \"polarization\" amplified by information chaos, that is, media polarisation fuelling divisions within countries, as well as polarisation between countries at the international level.\n*2. Ranking of Countries:*\na. Norway (1st), Denmark (2nd), Sweden (3rd) Estonia (4th) and Finland (5th) grabbed the top positions.\nb. North Korea remained at the bottom of the list of 180 countries.\n",
