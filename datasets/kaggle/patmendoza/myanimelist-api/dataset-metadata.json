  "descriptionNullable": "## MyAnimeList API Download\n\nThis is the dataset that I created as part of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** capstone project. The MyAnimeList website has a vast repository of ratings and rankings of viewership data that could be used for various methods. I extracted several datasets from the detail API from MyAnimeList (MAL) [https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig/references/api/v2](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig/references/api/v2) and plan to potentially update data every two weeks. \n\nMany possible uses for this data could be tracking what anime viewers are watching most within a particular time period, what's being scored (out of 10) well and what isn't. \n\nMy viz for this data will be part of a tableau dashboard located [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/patrick.mendoza5877/viz/WhatAnimetoWatchNextMyAnimeList/Dashboard). This dashboard allows fans to explore the dataset and locate top scored or popular titles by genre, time period, and demographic (although this field isn't always entered)\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe extraction and cleaning process is outlined on github [here](https://github.com/patmendoza330/). \n\n### Frequency of Updates\n\nI plan on updating this potentially every 2 weeks, this depends on my availability and the interest in this dataset.\n\n### Caveats\n\nExtracting and loading this data involved some transformations that should be noted:\n\n * This data only includes titles that correspond with the \"tv\" ranking category. This was in an effort to streamline extraction and fine tune the analysis. If you would like to see other categories you are welcome to suggest it as an enhancement or use the code create your own dataset. As a result of subsetting on \"tv\", the dataset excludes the following ranking categories:\n\t1. All\n\t2. airing\n\t3. upcoming\n\t4. ova\n\t5. movie\n\t6. special\n\t7. bypopularity\n\t8. favorite\n * Adult content - This extract excludes all adult content (r+). \n * **Note:** *The previous two points are valid for all tables with the exception of the rank_table. This is the table that was used as a starting point to obtain all MAL ids that were associated with \"tv\". Because this is a fast download, all categories are included in this table.*\n * The creation of the `alternative_title` field in the `anime_table`. This uses the english version of the name unless it is null, if the value is null, it uses the default name. This was in an effort to make the title accessible to english speakers. The original `title` field can be used if desired.\n * The extraction of the demographic information from the `genres` field. MyAnimeList includes demographic information (shounen, seinen etc.) in the genres field. I've extracted it so that it could be used as its own field. However, many of those fields are null making it somewhat difficult to use.\n * Cleaning processes of data. Various methods of cleaning data have been carried out and are noted on [github](https://github.com/patmendoza330/).\n * start\\_season.year - this field in the anime_table has been modified for null values. If there are null values, the first four characters from the `start_date` have been used. I will continue to use this method as long as it is viable.\n\n### Table Structure\n\nThe primary keys in all of the tables (with the exclusion of the `tm_ky` table) are foreign keys to other tables.
