In this place, sensitive items are being temporarily stored for a couple of hours before their shipment to the final destination. Predicting the temperature in the coming 4 hours is of interest to the secret room owner due to the high sensitivity of the stored items to temperature variations, and the impossibility to set up an advanced temperature control system.\n\nCan you predict the temperature of the next 4 hours using past data only?",
