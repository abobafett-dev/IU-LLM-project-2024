[link](http://rpubs.com/Paddy_5142/1193263)\n\n#### eBay Chart\n- **Growth and Stability**: Initially experienced growth until around 2014, followed by a decline.\n- **Quarterly Distribution**: Sales are evenly distributed across quarters with Q2 and Q4 just edging ahead. \n- **Revenue Variability**: Consistent range of quarterly sales over time, indicating stable revenue with some fluctuations within each year.\n- **Median Revenue**: Stable median annual revenue over the analysed period.\n\n### Overall Trends (Amazon, Alibaba and eBay).\n- **Growth Patterns**: All three companies have shown growth, though eBay's growth has plateaued while Alibaba and Amazon continue to expand significantly.\n- **Seasonality**: Alibaba and Amazon show clear seasonal trends, while eBay's sales are more evenly distributed throughout the year.\n- **Revenue Stability**: Despite fluctuations, all three companies demonstrate a stable range of quarterly sales, with consistent median annual revenues for eBay and rising medians for Alibaba and Amazon.\n\n### Future Sales Predictions\n\n**Linear Regression for Time Series.**\n\nIn its simplest form, linear regression for time series involves fitting a straight line to the data. This line represents the trend over time. You can include additional terms to account for seasonality or other patterns:\n - **Pros:**\n  - Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement.\n  - Interpretability: The coefficients directly relate to the trend and seasonal components.\n - **Cons:**\n  - Limited Flexibility: Assumes a linear relationship, which might not capture complex patterns.\n  - Sensitivity to Outliers: Can be significantly affected by extreme data points.\n\n#### Visualisation\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F13231939%2F23cd6f79f795f26948a776e1f26f50f5%2FScreenshot%202024-06-12%2013.58.05.png?generation=1718197585870117&alt=media)\n\nA Markdown document with R code for the above chart. [link](http://rpubs.com/Paddy_5142/1195914)\n\n**Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL).**\n\nSTL decomposes a time series into three components: trend, seasonality, and remainder (noise). It uses a robust smoothing technique called LOESS (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) to separate these components:\n  - **Pros:**\n   - Flexibility: Can handle a wide range of seasonal patterns.\n   - Robustness: Less affected by outliers compared to some other methods.\n   - Visualisation: Provides a clear visual representation of the components.\n  - **Cons:**\n   - Computationally Intensive: Can be slower for large datasets.\n   - Assumptions: Assumes that the seasonal pattern is consistent over time.\n\n**Exponential Smoothing with Seasonality (ETS).**\n\nETS models forecast by assigning exponentially decreasing weights to past observations. It has different variations to handle trends and seasonality, such as the Holt-Winters' method:\n- **Pros:**\n  - Adaptability: Can quickly adapt to changes in the underlying data patterns.\n  - Efficient: Relatively fast for forecasting.\n  - Variety: Offers different models to choose from based on your data.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Limited to Short-Term: Best for short-term forecasts due to its reliance on recent data.\n  - Less Interpretable: The parameters might not be as easily understood as in linear regression.\n\n**Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA).**\n\nSARIMA combines autoregressive (AR) terms, moving average (MA) terms, differentiating (I) to make the series stationary, and seasonal components. It's a powerful but complex model:\n- **Pros:**\n  - Flexibility: Can capture a wide range of patterns, including complex seasonality.\n  - Statistical Rigour: Based on solid statistical theory.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Complexity: Difficult to understand and requires careful parameter tuning.\n  - Computation: Can be computationally intensive for large datasets or complex models.\n\n#### Visualisations\n\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F13231939%2F75fc096ab8b586fe5f70291e4bd5da26%2FScreenshot%202024-06-12%2014.32.33.png?generation=1718199339444328&alt=media)\n\nThe above chart contains three forecast plots for Amazon's revenue in billions of USD, spanning from 2013 to 2034.

[link](http://rpubs.com/Paddy_5142/1195938)\n\n**Choosing the Right Prediction Model.**\n\nThe best model for your time series depends on several factors:\n- Data Characteristics: What patterns are present (trend, seasonality, cycles)?\n- Forecast Horizon: How far into the future do you need to forecast?\n- Computational Resources: How much computing power do you have?\n- Expertise: How comfortable are you with complex statistical models?\n\nIf you have a relatively simple time series with a clear trend and seasonality, linear regression or ETS might be sufficient. For more complex patterns or longer-term forecasts, STL or SARIMA might be better options.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAmazon, Alibaba, and eBay have each played significant roles in shaping the e-commerce landscape. Amazon is known for its vast product range and technological innovations, Alibaba for its support of Chinese SMEs and dominance in China, and eBay for pioneering online auctions and C2C commerce. Each company started with a unique vision and has evolved to become a global powerhouse, influencing how people buy and sell goods worldwide.\n\n\nPatrick Ford \ud83d\udcb2\n",

The platform allowed anyone to buy and sell items in an open marketplace.\n- **Name Change**: The company re-branded to eBay in 1997, reflecting its broader scope beyond auctions.\n\n#### Key Milestones\n- **Acquisitions**: eBay acquired several companies to enhance its services, including PayPal in 2002, which became a primary payment method for eBay transactions. PayPal was later spun off as an independent company in 2015.\n- **International Expansion**: eBay expanded globally, entering markets in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.\n- **Buy It Now**: Introduced in 2000, this feature allowed sellers to offer items at a fixed price, adding a new dimension to the platform beyond auctions.\n\n#### Impact\n- **Marketplace Pioneer**: eBay popularised online auctions and consumer-to-consumer sales, creating a new form of commerce.\n- **Economic Opportunities**: eBay provided a platform for individuals and small businesses to reach a global audience, democratising commerce.\n- **Community and Trust**: eBay established mechanisms for buyer and seller feedback, fostering a community-oriented approach to e-commerce.\n\n#### Visualisation\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F13231939%2F1940ee629e46be6a6328adf74e483097%2FScreenshot%202024-06-05%2020.28.30.png?generation=1717615953075050&alt=media)\n\nA Markdown document with R code for the above chart, with a full chart explanation. [link](http://rpubs.com/Paddy_5142/1193263)\n\n#### eBay Chart\n- **Growth and Stability**: Initially experienced growth until around 2014, followed by a decline.\n- **Quarterly Distribution**: Sales are evenly distributed across quarters with Q2 and Q4 just edging ahead. \n- **Revenue Variability**: Consistent range of quarterly sales over time, indicating stable revenue with some fluctuations within each year.\n- **Median Revenue**: Stable median annual revenue over the analysed period.\n\n### Overall Trends (Amazon, Alibaba and eBay).\n- **Growth Patterns**: All three companies have shown growth, though eBay's growth has plateaued while Alibaba and Amazon continue to expand significantly.\n- **Seasonality**: Alibaba and Amazon show clear seasonal trends, while eBay's sales are more evenly distributed throughout the year.\n- **Revenue Stability**: Despite fluctuations, all three companies demonstrate a stable range of quarterly sales, with consistent median annual revenues for eBay and rising medians for Alibaba and Amazon.\n\n### Future Sales Predictions\n\n**Linear Regression for Time Series.**\n\nIn its simplest form, linear regression for time series involves fitting a straight line to the data. This line represents the trend over time. You can include additional terms to account for seasonality or other patterns:\n - **Pros:**\n  - Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement.\n  - Interpretability: The coefficients directly relate to the trend and seasonal components.\n - **Cons:**\n  - Limited Flexibility: Assumes a linear relationship, which might not capture complex patterns.\n  - Sensitivity to Outliers: Can be significantly affected by extreme data points.\n\n#### Visualisation\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F13231939%2F23cd6f79f795f26948a776e1f26f50f5%2FScreenshot%202024-06-12%2013.58.05.png?generation=1718197585870117&alt=media)\n\nA Markdown document with R code for the above chart. [link](http://rpubs.com/Paddy_5142/1195914)\n\n**Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL).**\n\nSTL decomposes a time series into three components: trend, seasonality, and remainder (noise). It uses a robust smoothing technique called LOESS (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) to separate these components:\n  - **Pros:**\n   - Flexibility: Can handle a wide range of seasonal patterns.\n   - Robustness: Less affected by outliers compared to some other methods.\n   - Visualisation: Provides a clear visual representation of the components.\n  - **Cons:**\n   - Computationally Intensive: Can be slower for large datasets.\n   - Assumptions: Assumes that the seasonal pattern is consistent over time.\n\n**Exponential Smoothing with Seasonality (ETS).**\n\nETS models forecast by assigning exponentially decreasing weights to past observations. It has different variations to handle trends and seasonality, such as the Holt-Winters' method:\n- **Pros:**\n  - Adaptability: Can quickly adapt to changes in the underlying data patterns.\n  - Efficient: Relatively fast for forecasting.\n  - Variety: Offers different models to choose from based on your data.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Limited to Short-Term: Best for short-term forecasts due to its reliance on recent data.\n  - Less Interpretable: The parameters might not be as easily understood as in linear regression.\n\n**Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA).**\n\nSARIMA combines autoregressive (AR) terms, moving average (MA) terms, differentiating (I) to make the series stationary, and seasonal components. It's a powerful but complex model:\n- **Pros:**\n  - Flexibility: Can capture a wide range of patterns, including complex seasonality.\n  - Statistical Rigour: Based on solid statistical theory.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Complexity: Difficult to understand and requires careful parameter tuning.\n  - Computation: Can be computationally intensive for large datasets or complex models.\n\n#### Visualisations\n\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F13231939%2F75fc096ab8b586fe5f70291e4bd5da26%2FScreenshot%202024-06-12%2014.32.33.png?generation=1718199339444328&alt=media)\n\nThe above chart contains three forecast plots for Amazon's revenue in billions of USD, spanning from 2013 to 2034.

[link](http://rpubs.com/Paddy_5142/1195938)\n\n**Choosing the Right Prediction Model.**\n\nThe best model for your time series depends on several factors:\n- Data Characteristics: What patterns are present (trend, seasonality, cycles)?\n- Forecast Horizon: How far into the future do you need to forecast?\n- Computational Resources: How much computing power do you have?\n- Expertise: How comfortable are you with complex statistical models?\n\nIf you have a relatively simple time series with a clear trend and seasonality, linear regression or ETS might be sufficient. For more complex patterns or longer-term forecasts, STL or SARIMA might be better options.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAmazon, Alibaba, and eBay have each played significant roles in shaping the e-commerce landscape. Amazon is known for its vast product range and technological innovations, Alibaba for its support of Chinese SMEs and dominance in China, and eBay for pioneering online auctions and C2C commerce.
