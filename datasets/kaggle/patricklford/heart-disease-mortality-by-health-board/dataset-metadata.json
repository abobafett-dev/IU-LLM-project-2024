Anger can cause the release of stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, which can raise blood pressure. Anger can also cause the blood vessels to constrict, which can further raise blood pressure.\nPeople who are angry or hostile tend to have higher blood pressure than those who are not. Anger can also cause blood pressure to spike temporarily, even in people who do not have hypertension.\n\nAnger and stress can lead to unhealthy lifestyle choices, such as smoking, drinking, unhealthy eating, and lack of exercise. These unhealthy lifestyle choices can then lead to ill health, such as heart disease.\nIn addition, anger and stress can also lead to long-term negative mood patterns. These negative mood patterns can make it difficult to make healthy lifestyle choices and can also lead to further ill health.\n\nIt is likely that both happiness and lifestyle choices play a role in ill health. People who are happy are more likely to make healthy lifestyle choices, and people who make healthy lifestyle choices are more likely to be happy. However, it is difficult to say which factor is more important, as both happiness and lifestyle choices are complex and multifaceted.\n\n**Can Happiness help your health ?**\n\nLaughter can help to reduce stress, improve mood, and boost the immune system. It can also help to reduce pain and improve circulation.\nLaughter is also a great way to connect with others and build relationships. It can help to create a sense of community and belonging.\nOverall, laughter is a great way to improve your overall health and well-being. It is a natural and effective way to relieve stress, improve mood, and boost the immune system.

In some ways, external things can indeed make us happy and content at least for a while. Yet, they can never completely quench our insatiable craving for more power and possessions.
