[link](https://www.statista.com/statistics/373946/global-spending-and-growth-in-oncology-market/#:~:text=This%20statistic%20shows%20a%20projection,218%20billion%20U.S.%20dollars%20worldwide.)\n- Cancer Medicine Spending: In 2021, cancer medicine spending rose to $185 billion globally, with 74% focused on the major developed markets (the United States, EU4+UK and Japan). [link](https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports/global-oncology-trends-2022)\n- Per Capita Spending: The median per capita spending in USD for cancer care was $296, with the US spending more than any other country ($584). [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9142870/) \n- Economic Cost of Cancers: According to a study published in JAMA Oncology, cancers will cost the world economy INT $25.2 trillion between 2020 and 2050, which is equivalent to an annual tax of $840 billion. [link](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2801798)\n\nOverall, while there is limited data on the detailed breakdown of national expenditure specific to cancer treatment , it is clear that global spending on oncology is significant. [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6686500/)\n\n**Early Diagnosis of Cancer**: \n\nEarly diagnosis of cancer is crucial for successful treatment and better outcomes. [link](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/https%3A//www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/spot-cancer-early/why-is-early-diagnosis-important?_gl=1*pkukcc*_gcl_au*MTg1NTk1NjY1Mi4xNjkyMTE5OTM2*_ga*Njg4Mjc0NjY0LjE2OTIxMTk4ODY.*_ga_58736Z2GNN*MTY5MjExOTg4Ni4xLjEuMTY5MjExOTkzNy45LjAuMA..&_ga=2.90720986.1767943344.1692119886-688274664.1692119886)\n\nHere are some benefits of early diagnosis of cancer:\n- Higher survival rates: People diagnosed earlier with cancer are more likely to survive compared to those diagnosed late. \n- Better experiences of care: People diagnosed earlier with cancer are more likely to have better experiences of care, lower treatment morbidity, and improved quality of life compared with those diagnosed late. [link](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/piis1470-2045(19)30658-8/fulltext)\n- Lower cost of treatment: Early diagnosis can significantly reduce the cost of treatment. Studies in high-income countries show that treatment costs for early-diagnosed patients are two to four times less expensive than treating those diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer. [link](https://ascopost.com/News/59711)\n- Increased longevity: Patients whose cancer is detected early on possess a higher chance of cured disease, complete recovery, increased quality of life, and longevity. [link](https://www.wattanosothcancerhospital.com/en/all-about-cancer/the-importance-of-early-detection-of-cancer)\n- Early detection: Allows a more effective treatment when the cancer is at an earlier, much more curable stage, and is associated with significantly reduced mortality.\n- Less aggressive treatment: Detection of some cancers at an early stage combined with prompt treatment permits less aggressive treatment, leading to a better quality of life of the patient. [link](https://canceratlas.cancer.org/taking-action/early-detection/)\n\nIn summary, early diagnosis of cancer improves survival rates, experiences of care, quality of life, and reduces the cost and complexity of cancer treatment.

[link](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/cancer-survival-statistics/cancer-survival-statistics-people-diagnosed-with-cancer-during-2018-to-2020/)\n\nThe fact that, in England, more than 90% of cancers are detected outside the three national screening programmes (for cervical, breast, and bowel cancers) highlights the importance of presenting promptly to primary care with potential cancer symptoms. [link](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/piis1470-2045(19)30658-8/fulltext)\n\n**Technology can help earlier Cancer Diagnosis.**\n\nNano sniffer technology is a relatively new field, and its use in medicine is still being explored. [link](https://iit-techambit.in/nanosniffer/)\n\nHere are some of the up-to-date uses of nano sniffer technology in medicine:\n- Disease diagnosis: Electronic-nose (e-nose) technology can be used to identify microbes and individual disease biomarkers from their precise mixtures of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in real-time directly from patients. This technology can be used to diagnose a wide range of medical conditions.\n- Contamination detection: Medical instruments and equipment to be used in operations could be checked for contamination by chemicals or microbes, via e-nose sniffing.\n- Drug and alcohol detection: Several studies have indicated the potential application of electronic noses for detecting the prior ingestion of drugs and alcohol, in cases of substance abuse. [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3274093/)\n- Disease detection: Researchers are working on developing a disease-sniffing device that rivals a dog\u2019s nose. The device incorporates mammalian olfactory receptors stabilised to act as sensors, whose data streams can be handled in real-time by a typical smartphone\u2019s capabilities. [link](https://news.mit.edu/2021/disease-detection-device-dogs-0217) \n\nOverall, nano sniffer technology has the potential to revolutionise the field of medicine by providing fast, accurate, and non-invasive diagnostic tools. However, more research is needed to fully explore the capabilities of this technology. [link](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285203/reporting)\n\n**Nano sniffer technology has the potential to detect a wide range of diseases.**\n\nHere are some of the diseases that are being detected using this technology:\n- Malaria, Leishmaniasis, Trypanosomiasis, and Babesiosis: These diseases can be detected through optical microscopy using nanotech tools. [link](https://www.scidev.net/asia-pacific/news/nanotech-tool-may-help-detect-diseases-using-a-smartphone/)\n- Ebola virus disease and SARS-CoV-2: Novel nano-sensors can rapidly detect infectious diseases such as Ebola virus disease and SARS-CoV-2. [link](https://www.technologynetworks.com/diagnostics/news/novel-nano-sensors-rapidly-detect-infectious-diseases-358190)\n- Cancer and Parkinson\u2019s: The Nanose device analyses breath to detect diseases such as cancer and Parkinson\u2019s, even in their earliest stages. [link](https://www.israel21c.org/sniffing-out-diseases-with-the-nanose/)\n- 17 diseases including 8 different cancers: Scientists have created a portable device that can detect 17 diseases, including 8 different types of cancer, straight from a person\u2019s breath. [link](https://bigthink.com/health/scientists-create-tricorder-like-device-that-can-detect-17-diseases-from-your-breath/)\n- Malaria and cancer: Recent developments in nanofiber-based sensors have made much progress in detecting malaria, cancer, and other diseases using nanofibers for sensing. [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666053920300023)\n\nOverall, nano sniffer technology has the potential to revolutionise the field of medicine by providing fast, accurate, and non-invasive diagnostic tools for a wide range of diseases. However, more research is needed to fully explore the capabilities of this technology.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCancer, as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, demands the attention of medical professionals, policymakers, and the general public alike. The burgeoning global expenditure on oncology corroborates the significant weight this ailment bears on the world's healthcare system. Therefore, finding efficient means to manage and potentially curb this health crisis becomes an imperative. One of the most potent tools at our disposal in the fight against cancer is the early diagnosis of the disease.\n\nThe benefits of early diagnosis are manifold. As documented in the project, diagnosing cancer in its nascent stages significantly bolsters survival rates, elevates the experience and quality of care received by patients, enhances the overall quality of life, and importantly, drives down both the costs and intricacies associated with cancer treatments. Such benefits underscore the profound importance of prompt diagnosis and also cast a light on the tangible repercussions of delays in such processes. \n\nThe data from 2018 to 2020 glaringly showcases the deteriorating survival rates during the quarterly periods. This downturn underscores the devastating impact that unforeseen events, like the COVID-19 pandemic, can have on cancer diagnosis. Specifically in Scotland, the pandemic had repercussions beyond the immediate threat of the virus, leading to a significant 8% under-diagnosis of cancers in 2020. The even more pronounced drops in diagnoses for earlier-stage cancers are a cause for concern, given the pivotal role early diagnosis plays in patient prognosis.\n\nIt's disconcerting to realise that in England, where a substantial 90% of cancers are detected outside the conventional national screening paradigms, there's an enhanced emphasis on the role primary care plays. These findings stress the importance of individuals being proactive in seeking care when potential cancer symptoms manifest, rather than relying solely on periodic screenings.\n\nYet, even amidst these challenges, the horizon of medical technology offers glimmers of hope. Enter the arena of nano sniffer technology. Still in its embryonic stages in medical applications, the technology promises to be a game-changer. The rapidity, precision, and non-invasiveness of nano sniffer diagnostic tools can potentially shift paradigms. With capabilities to diagnose a plethora of diseases, including various cancers, the integration of this technology could make early detection more accessible and commonplace.\n\nIn conclusion, the battle against cancer is undeniably complex, with early detection standing as one of our most formidable weapons. The data presents a pressing case for continuous innovation, public awareness, and resource allocation in the realm of early diagnosis. Technologies like the nano sniffer are not just promising, they might be indispensable in our collective quest to turn the tide against cancer.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Personal recommendation* - I first watched this film 'Hoxsey; The Quack Who Cured Cancer', many years ago.
