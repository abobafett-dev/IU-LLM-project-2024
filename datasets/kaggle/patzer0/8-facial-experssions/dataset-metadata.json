It includes a total of 575 labeled images, meticulously curated and annotated to support image recognition and classification tasks. To ensure diversity and adequate representation, images of other ethnicities were included to supplement categories with insufficient data. This dataset is valuable for various machine learning and computer vision applications, especially those focusing on facial expression detection and analysis.\n\n# **Data Collection and Annotation**\n\n**Collection:** The images were collected using the Bing Image API, ensuring a diverse and high-quality set of facial expression images. \n\n**Annotation:** The annotation process was carried out manually using makesense.ai to guarantee high-quality labels. Each of the 575 images was carefully annotated to provide precise data for training models.\n\n# **Usage**\n\nThis dataset can be directly used for training ultralytics/YOLOv8 models. Before starting the training, you need to modify the \"path:\" value in the dataset.yaml file to reflect the location where you have stored this dataset. The train.txt, val.txt, and test.txt files are already split in a ratio of 8:1:1, facilitating a streamlined workflow for model training and validation.\n\n**Note:** test.txt contains the paths of the test images, which comprise 10% of the entire dataset.\n\n# **Disclaimer**\n\nAs an individual, you may use this dataset for free. However, some images in the dataset may be subject to copyright restrictions. If you intend to use the dataset for commercial purposes, please be aware of these potential copyright issues.",
