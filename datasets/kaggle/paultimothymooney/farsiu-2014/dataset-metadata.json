Our preliminary results indicate differences in measured thickness between and even within manufacturers (e.g., a correction factor of 1.16 would be used to convert our reported thicknesses at central fovea to those from Spectralis [Heidelberg Inc, Heidelberg, Germany]). \n\nFor this study, we used the dataset from the A2A SD-OCT\nStudy, which was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier:\nNCT00734487) and approved by the institutional review boards of\nthe 4 A2A SD-OCT clinics (Devers Eye Institute, Duke Eye\nCenter, Emory Eye Center, and National Eye Institute). With\nadherence to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, informed\nconsent was obtained from all subjects.\n\nThe AREDS2 and A2A SD-OCT Study design and protocol for\ngrading fundus photographs (AREDS2) and SD-OCT images\n(A2A SD-OCT) have been described.20,21 In brief, subjects who\nmet the following inclusion criteria were enrolled: between 50 and\n85 years of age, exhibiting intermediate AMD with large drusen\n(&gt;125 mm) in both eyes or large drusen in 1 eligible eye and\nadvanced AMD in the fellow eye, with no history of vitreoretinal\nsurgery or ophthalmologic disease that might affect acuity in either\neye. Age-appropriate control subjects were enrolled with the same\ninclusion criteria as for AREDS2 except that they must have had\nno evidence of macular drusen or AMD in either eye at the baseline\nvisit or in the follow-up years. Stereoscopic color fundus photograph\npairs were taken at the baseline visit as part of the AREDS2\nprotocol20 and then graded by certified readers at the Wisconsin\nFundus Photography Reading Center (University of Wisconsin,\nMadison, WI). For our study, eyes assigned a Wisconsin drusen\narea score of \u201ccannot grade\u201d (drusen area was only partially\nvisible for the field under consideration, such as when an\nobscuring lesion or poor photographic quality did not permit\na reasonably confident assessment of drusen) at the Wisconsin\nCenter were excluded.\n\nThe SD-OCT imaging systems from Bioptigen, Inc (Research\nTriangle Park, NC), located at the 4 clinic sites, were used to\nacquire volumetric rectangular (w6.7\u0001w6.7 mm) scans as\npreviously published.21 To summarize, for all subjects, 0 and 90\nrectangular volumes centered at the fovea (defined as volumes\nacquired with the fast scan direction oriented horizontally and\nvertically, respectively) with 1000 A-scans per B-scan and 100\nB-scans per volume were captured for both eyes. In the A2A\nSD-OCT Study, of the 345 participants with AMD, 314 had at\nleast 1 eye with intermediate AMD, and of the 122 control subjects\nwithout AMD, 119 had no eye disease at baseline.21 From these, 1\neligible eye of each subject had been randomly selected as the\nstudy eye as detailed by Leuschen et al.21 Eye length was not\nmeasured. Certified SD-OCT readers assessed the scan quality\nfor each volume.21 For this study, we selected the 0 volumes by\ndefault, and any poor-quality (as assessed by graders)\n0 volumes were replaced by a 90 volume from the same visit; if\nboth scan volumes were poor, then the eye was excluded altogether.\nThe excluded eyes were mainly those that contained blank\nor extremely low-quality images due to blinks or imaging errors or\nthose volumes that exhibited significant eye motion or loss of\nfixation during image acquisition. Thus, in this study, we analyzed\n269 of the 314 eyes with intermediate AMD and 115 of the 119\ncontrol (normal) eyes.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n\nhttp://people.duke.edu/~sf59/Farsiu_Ophthalmology_2013.pdf\nhttp://people.duke.edu/~sf59/RPEDC_Ophth_2013_dataset.htm\n\nS.
