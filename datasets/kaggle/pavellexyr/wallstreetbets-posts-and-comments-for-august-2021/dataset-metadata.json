That was a sign that social media can influence market data in ways before unseen. To help data scientists investigate this, we have compiled a comprehensive dataset of posts and comments on /r/WallStreetBets for the month of August 2021. \n\n\n### Content\n\nThe following dataset is a comprehensive list of all the posts and comments made on Reddit's WallStreetBets board from August 1 to August 31 of 2021. The data includes sentiment, post and comment content and timestamps. The dataset was procured using [SocialGrep](https://socialgrep.com/datasets?utm_source=kaggle&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=dataset&utm_term=wallstreetbets#wsb-aug-2021).\n\nTo preserve traders' anonymity and to prevent targeted harassment, the data does not include usernames.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset is dedicated to \"Koe\", an instrumental force in Reddit data compilation and public opinion research. He is no longer with us - may he be in a better place.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\n- Can we predict stock trends based on Reddit data?\n- How does public perception of a stock shift with the news?\n- Are there any other insights that we can get from the board that caused the Short Squeeze of 2021?",
