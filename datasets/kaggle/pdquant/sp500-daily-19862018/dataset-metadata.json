Most public data only goes back to the 2000's , or if it's longer term, is weekly frequency instead of daily. So I have compiled this dataset containing **Daily Closing Prices** for the **SPY** going from **1986 to 2018**. \n\n\n### Content\nThe dataset is simple - a CSV format with one column with a daily **timestamp** and the second with the raw, un-adjusted **closing prices** for each day.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nWith this longer term, more granular time series dataset, researchers now have a good sized publicly available financial dataset to explore time series trends or use as part of a quantitative finance project.",
