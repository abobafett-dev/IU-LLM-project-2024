This dataset contains relative new information which may be helpful for you in predicting new trends such as **COVID-19**\uff09. The standard that how I labeled is based on the other two already exist datasets. So when you judge the sentences you might have some different feelings. Hope if you also do this job you can share your data with us if you can! Also looking forward to have a thumb up from you!\n\n",
