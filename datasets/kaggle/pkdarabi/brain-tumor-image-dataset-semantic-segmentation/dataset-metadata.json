This fine-grained approach provides an accurate understanding of the spatial distribution of tumors within medical images.\n\n###Classes:\nThis dataset is divided into two classes:\n**Class 0 (Non-Tumor):\n- Pixels labeled as non-tumor represent areas without any tumor presence in the medical images.\n**Class 1 (Tumor):\n- Pixels labeled as tumors correspond to areas where tumors are detected.\n\n###Usage of the Dataset:\n**Researchers** and practitioners in the field of medical image analysis can use this dataset to train and evaluate semantic segmentation models for tumor detection. The binary classification into tumor and non-tumor classes simplifies the **segmentation task**, making it suitable for various applications.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F14850461%2F2c1a10de3bcd5b739209c20c0e9e9680%2FUntitled.png?generation=1705682115539120&alt=media)",
