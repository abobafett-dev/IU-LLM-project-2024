It serves as the basis for an industrial case study on the application of machine learning in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The primary objective of this exercise is to develop a machine-learning model capable of predicting the categorical topic of a document based on the available text features, such as the **title**, **description**, complete **text content**, and more.\n\nThe dataset consists of multiple instances, each containing various features that provide information about the documents. The main target variable in this dataset is the **category** column, which indicates the topic or category of the content. This column serves as the target variable for the prediction task.\n\n**Additional features in the dataset include**\n - **Description:** This column describes the document.\n - **Text_content:** This column contains the complete text content of the document.\n - **Title:** This column represents the title of the document.\n - **h1 and h2:** These columns contain the content within the HTML tags h1 and h2, respectively.\n - **URL:** This column specifies the link address associated with the document.\n - **Domain:** This column indicates the domain or website from which the document originates.\n - **Id:** This column represents the unique identifier for each link.\n\nWith the provided features and the target variable, the Yektanet dataset offers a valuable resource for training and evaluating machine learning models in the domain of **NLP**. It enables researchers and practitioners to explore and develop effective approaches for document categorization and topic prediction tasks.",
