The names of the directories are \"class labels\" to be used for prediction.\n\nThe TEST images can be ignored for practise as it doesn't contain the labels. \n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI got this dataset from https://dockship.io/ from a challenge hosted there.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nTo build powerful Neural Network models that can classify these images with high level of accuracy.",
