  "descriptionNullable": "*Title: Smart insect traps report the population dynamics of *Helicoverpa armigera* in cotton plantations*\n\n**Context**\nThe electronic funnel trap (e-funnel) is an optical counter attached to typical, plastic, funnel traps to automatically count all captured Lepidoptera species with known pheromone as they enter in the bucket. The pests follow the chemical signals of the pheromone and land on the pheromone dispenser. With time they get exhausted and fall in the trap. Once an insect falls in, it interrupts a flow of infrared light and thus it is counted. The device senses the entrance of the insect and registers a capture event, the data-stamp of the event, GPS coordinates and the environmental variables at that time. Data are delivered through the mobile network from the field to a server without human intervention. At the server data are streamlined and visualized and alerts are issued automatically. See an example here (needs sound from the loudspeaker): https://www.insectronics.net/demos \nSee also https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06390 \n\n\n**Why are e-traps important?**\n1. They sample insect fauna in order to make informative assumptions on the actual pest load of large areas to reach decisions on treatment. \n2. The time at which each insect is captured is precisely determined making it well-suited to monitor circadian rhythms, peak activities, behavioral patterns and population dynamics\n3. They timely predict the occurrence of the onset of an infestation and the location of its concentration can define the decisions on an insecticide application program.\n4. They reduce considerable monitoring cost and, therefore can expand to hundreds of nodes that monitor large spatial scales. Man power constraints and cost can make manual monitoring problematic. E-traps can report many times per day whereas manual counting is usually once per 7-10 days.\n5. The knowledge of where and when there is an infestation load can mitigate uniform, unnecessary sprayings that are usually applied by farmers in fear of crop loss.\n6. One can use historical data to predict the evolution of the infestation load.\n\n**Content**\nIn the Summer of 2021, 5 e-traps have been deployed in different parts of northern Greece, to monitor Helicoverpa armigera (the cotton bollworm) in large cotton plantations for approximately three months. The dataset consists of 5 different excel files corresponding to approximately 3 months of monitoring time (June-September).\nThe code snippets analyzing the data in the 'Code' tab investigate several aspects and statistical characteristics of this data as well as predicting future infestation load based on past data.\n\n**Acknowledgments**\nThe data have been recorded using automatic insect traps (optical counters) published in:\nIraklis I.

E-traps based on optical counters can provide consistent estimates of insects\u2019 presence (detection/infestation onset), population dynamics (monitoring) but they are also useful for evaluating insecticide treatment efficacy (post-treatment analysis) and control purposes (population reduction). These traps offer services that are impractical to deliver manually. They monitor and report insect populations 24 h a day and thus can determine the precise onset and evolution of an infestation. If the user configures the report update on a per hour basis, then the network of traps can infer the dynamics of pest populations. Dense reporting can evaluate the impact of a control treatment (e.g., chemical/biological spraying, release of beneficial entomophagous insects etc.). E-traps timestamp all captured events, so one can track insects\u2019 response to pheromones, their activity related to the circadian rhythm and the optimal time for treatment application.\nE-traps based on optical counters, count captured insects upon their entrance and therefore they do not face the problem of camera-based traps with insects piling up, disintegrating and illumination variations. Optical counters are totally immune to audio noise as they do not make use of microphones. Our implementation discerns the direction of the moving insect and therefore does not register double counts. Insects that differ significantly in size compared to the targeted pest are rejected as they produce light fluctuations whose amplitudes are out of bound. E-traps using optical counters rely on the specificity of the pheromone to attract only the targeted pest.",
