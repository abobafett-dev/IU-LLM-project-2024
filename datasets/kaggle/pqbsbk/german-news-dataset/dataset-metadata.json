To collect this kind of information, I built newspipe a scalable pipeline to crawl and extract data from news websites. Showing the power and flexibility of the pipeline, I collected articles from German-speaking publishers by providing the pipeline only with the URL of the website. This dataset is the result of the demonstration. I mainly crawled articles from 15 news sources over an extended period of time. The remaining 33 news sources were only test runs. \n\n\n### Content\n- `author` : author name as string (may contain unrelevant information)\n- `published`: publish date as unix timestamp (int value)\n- `title`: article title as string\n- `summary`: summary of the article (not cleaned)\n- `text`: article text as string\n- `link`: link to news article\n- `tags`: tags of the article (optional)\n\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nIf you found this dataset useful, cite:\n```\n@misc{steven mi_2020, title={German News Dataset}, url={https://www.kaggle.com/dsv/1679751}, DOI={10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/1679751}, publisher={Kaggle}, author={Steven Mi}, year={2020} }\n```\n\nI hope you can make some cool analyses with this dataset.",
