  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset is a collection of images designed for training machine learning models in the recognition and classification of Malaysian Sign Language (MSL) signs. It encompasses three distinct categories, each critical for a comprehensive understanding of MSL:\n\nAlphabets (Alphabet_MSL): This segment consists of images depicting individual letters of the MSL alphabet. Each image is a clear, focused representation of a hand gesture corresponding to an MSL letter, formatted in .jpg for optimal compatibility with machine learning algorithms.\n\nSingle Words (SingleWord_MSL): Here, key basic words used in MSL communication are visually represented. This category is vital for models intended to recognize common vocabulary in sign language.\n\nNumbers (Number_MSL): This part contains images illustrating numeric signs in MSL, covering a range from simple digits.",
