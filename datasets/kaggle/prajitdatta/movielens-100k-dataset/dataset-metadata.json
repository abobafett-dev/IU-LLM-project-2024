The project is lead\nby professors John Riedl and Joseph Konstan. The project began to\nexplore automated collaborative filtering in 1992, but is most well\nknown for its world wide trial of an automated collaborative filtering\nsystem for Usenet news in 1996.  The technology developed in the\nUsenet trial formed the base for the formation of Net Perceptions,\nInc., which was founded by members of GroupLens Research. Since then\nthe project has expanded its scope to research overall information\nfiltering solutions, integrating in content-based methods as well as\nimproving current collaborative filtering technology.\n\nFurther information on the GroupLens Research project, including\nresearch publications, can be found at the following web site:\n        \n        http://www.grouplens.org/\n\nGroupLens Research currently operates a movie recommender based on\ncollaborative filtering:\n\n        http://www.movielens.org/\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF DATA FILES\n==============================================\n\nHere are brief descriptions of the data.\n\nml-data.tar.gz   -- Compressed tar file.
