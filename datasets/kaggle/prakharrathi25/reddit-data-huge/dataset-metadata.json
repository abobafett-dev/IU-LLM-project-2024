Reddit is broken up into more than a million communities known as \u201csubreddits,\u201d each of which covers a different topic. The name of a subreddit begins with /r/, which is part of the URLs that Reddit uses. For example, /r/nba is a subreddit where people talk about the National Basketball Association, while /r/boardgames is a subreddit for people to discuss board games.\n\n### Content\n\nIn this dataset, I have added data from many different subreddits.
