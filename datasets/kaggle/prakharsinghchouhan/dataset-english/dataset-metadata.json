  "descriptionNullable": "In recent years, advancements in computer vision and deep learning have revolutionized the field of object detection, enabling a wide range of applications in various domains. One crucial application is road safety, where accurate and efficient object detection plays a vital role in preventing accidents and improving traffic management. To address the challenges unique to this domain, researchers and developers have created specialized datasets tailored specifically for road-related object detection tasks. Among these datasets, the ROAD MARK Dataset is a comprehensive and valuable resource for training and evaluating object detection models.\n\nThe ROAD MARK Dataset is a curated collection of annotated images and videos focusing on detecting and classifying road markings and related objects. It encompasses a diverse range of scenarios encountered on roads, including highways, urban streets, and rural areas, making it highly representative of real-world conditions. The dataset includes various types of road markings, such as lane lines, arrows, pedestrian crossings, speed limit signs, and other relevant objects like traffic lights and barriers.\n\nThis dataset contains 2892 samples, which dataset (as you can see in the image) is correctly divided into three parts: Train, Valid, Test!!\n\nMade from [Road Mark Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/road-mark-detection) Dataset.\n\n**2892 Images : Split into Train, Test and Validation Set**\n**13 classes** : ` 'BUS LANE', 'Yellow Markings', 'Line 1', 'Line 2', 'Crossing', 'Romb', 'SLOW', 'Left Arrow', 'Forward Arrow', 'Forward Arrow -Left', 'Forward Arrow -Right', 'Right Arrow', 'Bicycle'`\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F15388830%2F0dabcf21a007a420e3040beb6c817444%2FScreenshot%202024-01-14%20150946.jpg?generation=1705225224472534&alt=media)\n",
