This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths, and recovery from the 2019 novel coronavirus. Please note that this is time-series data and so the number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number.\n\n### Content\nThe dataset includes **28 files** scrapped from various data sources mainly the **John Hopkins GitHub repository, the ministry of health affairs India, worldometer, and Our World in Data website.** The details of the files are as follows \n\n- `countries-aggregated.csv`\nA simple and cleaned data with 5 columns with self-explanatory names.\n-`covid-19-daily-tests-vs-daily-new-confirmed-cases-per-million.csv`\nA time-series data of daily test conducted v/s daily new confirmed case per million.
