The first cases were seen in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019 before spreading globally. The current outbreak was officially recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.\nCurrently **Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)** is used for diagnosis of the COVID-19. X-ray machines are widely available and provide images for diagnosis quickly so chest X-ray images can be very useful in early diagnosis of COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n### Content\n\nDataset is organized into 2 folders (train, test) and both train and test contain 3 subfolders (COVID19, PNEUMONIA, NORMAL). DataSet contains total 6432 x-ray images and test data have 20% of total images.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nImages are collected from various publicly available resources.
