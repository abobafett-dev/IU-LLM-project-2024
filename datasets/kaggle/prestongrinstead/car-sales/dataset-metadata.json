Some of the packages have changed as the python version was different, but I fine tuned it to run with Python 3.9xx and updated the url's.  The file titled 'car_sales_data_original' can be accessed on the right hand side, and consists the uncleaned raw data that was extracted. The other file is tailored to what I needed, which  were sales trends over a 20-year period (1993-2013) and it is cleaned.  The 'original' file contains all years there is data for (about 16,000 items) as I re-ran the scraper before posting.  Enjoy and have fun!",
