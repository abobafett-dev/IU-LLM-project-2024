Here's a link to the \n\nThe revenue by payment type visual's a function of the 4 payment types recorded in the payments table, and a measure created from the sum of all the payments recorded in the payments table. the reason for this is to aid the organization know which payment channels are user favourite.\n\nThe card visuals give us a break down of all activity going on in the dataset, for instance, it tells us about the number of vendors in the dataset, the total orders created vs total orders delivered, a count of the total transactions carried out in the dataset, the total products recorded in the dataset, the shipping cost which is a sum of all the freight fees, average shipping cost which is the average of all recorded shipping fees, total revenue recorded in the dataset,  as well as a measurement of the average days to delivery. This measure is a calculation derived from a filter function. The formula uses the IF function to check if the estimated delivery date is earlier than the actual delivery date. If it is, then the delivery is considered late and the formula calculates the delay by subtracting the actual delivery date from the estimated delivery date and then negating the result (using the minus sign). If the estimated delivery date is not earlier than the actual delivery date, then the delivery is considered on time and the formula simply returns the estimated delivery date. The result of this formula is assigned to the variable Delivery_Status. the importance of the average days to delivery card visual is to give management a working schedule for them to create a mandate to reduce the time it takes on average to deliver an order.\n\nThe revenue by month visual is a function of the summation of the Payment_Value being price + freight_value, itemized according to the months they were carried out in. this allows management to know which months the most revenue are generated in.\n\nThe daily payment pattern is a function of the payment values recorded, and the dates in which the orders were approved because if the orders were rejected, the payments had to be refunded, so if the orders were approved, it meant the payments went through. I derived the visual from a synthetic table i created called ORD2, which is a concatenation of the payment table and the order dates table, but with a filter function of where the order status is anything but rejected or cancelled or pending. i made this visual just to create a simple visualization of how payments came in during which periods. I split the date on the x-axis to be between 6 months intervals to compress all that time period into that space.\n\nThe revenue trend visual is derived from the payment values in the ordered items table and the dates in which orders were approved at from  the order dates table, without any filter functions being carried out on it, still following the previous arguement.\n\nThe customer and deller distribution visuals show us where our customers and sellers are located in. because of time constraints, i might have tried to establish a bias as to why customers bought from which seller, but in subsequent datasets i analyzed during this period i showed that bias in the restaurat ratings analysis i did for a mexican restaurant, so if you watch more of my videos you would see that. but the essence of this visuals is just to create a simple perceptive indulgence.\n\nThe seller ratings visuals is a breakdown of the average rating of all the ratings each seller id was able to accumulate. the same was done for each product in the product rating visuals. this makes it easy for management to spot out which products or sellers are performing and those not performing. so from this they can make the decision to motivate or remove from the platform. \n\nFor the grand rating visual, I creatd 2 measures i called one: 'the achieved rating' which is the average of the reviews score from the reviews table, which i inserted as the main value, then i created the expected rating measure which i set to 5, being the maimum rating attainable. This visual is important because it give management a general overview of what the entire ratings on the plaktform looks like and motivates them to work around increasing it to the maximum.\n\nfor the last visual i'll explain, i used the delivery status measure i created and explained earlier as the value, then i created another measure i called the 'estimated delivery' which is a summation of the 'purchase till estimated' delivery column i created under the delivery dates table. the 'purchase till estimated' measure is an expression I used to calculate the number of working days between the purchase date of an order and its estimated delivery date Here's a breakdown of the different parts of the expression: the calculated field is created by the contained expressions in lines 3 to 5. line 3 counts the number of rows in the 'Calendar Table'. Line 4 filters the dates in the 'Calendar Table'between the order purchase timestamp and the estimated delivery date minus one day. The first part of line 5: \"'Calendar Table' [Working_Day] = TRUE\" filters the working days from the filtered dates obtained above, then the: \"ALL ('Delivery Dates')\" expression removes any additional filters applied to the 'Delivery Dates' table. The result is the number of working days between the purchase date and the estimated delivery date of the order.",
