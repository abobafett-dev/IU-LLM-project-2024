Both the extractive and abstractive approaches of summarization are implemented in different languages. A significant amount of data is a primary need for any summarization. For the Bengali language, there are only a few datasets are available. Our dataset is made for Bengali Abstractive News Summarization (BANS) purposes. As abstractive summarization is basically neural network-based it needs more and more data to perform well. So we made a standard Bengali abstractive summarization data crawling from online Bengali news portal bangla.bdnews24.com. We crawled more than 19k articles and summaries and standardized the data.\n\nList of files:\n1.  article.txt\n2. summary.txt\n\n#**Dataset Description** \n| Description | Data Info. |\n|---|---|\n| Total no of articles | 19096 |\n| Total no of summaries| 19096 |\n| Maximum no of words in an article | 76 |\n| Maximum no of words in a summary | 12 |\n| Minimum no of words in an article | 5 |\n| Minimum no of words in a summary  | 3 |\n\n\n\n#**Acknowledgement**\nWe would like to thank Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST) research center and SUST NLP research group for their support.\n\n#**Bibtex for Citation**\n\n@InProceedings{10.1007/978-981-33-4673-4_4,\nauthor=\"Bhattacharjee, Prithwiraj\nand Mallick, Avi\nand Saiful Islam, Md.\nand Marium-E-Jannat\",\neditor=\"Kaiser, M.

Due to abstractive summarization's underlying complexities, most of the past research work has been done on the extractive summarization approach. Nevertheless, with the triumph of the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model, abstractive summarization becomes more viable. Although a significant number of notable research has been done in the English language based on abstractive summarization, only a couple of works have been done on Bengali abstractive news summarization (BANS). In this article, we presented a seq2seq based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network model with attention at encoder-decoder. Our proposed system deploys a local attention-based model that produces a long sequence of words with lucid and human-like generated sentences with noteworthy information of the original document. We also prepared a dataset of more than 19 k articles and corresponding human-written summaries collected from bangla.bdnews24.com (https://bangla.bdnews24.com/) which is till now the most extensive dataset for Bengali news document summarization and publicly published in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/prithwirajsust/bengali-news-summarization-dataset) We evaluated our model qualitatively and quantitatively and compared it with other published results. It showed significant improvement in terms of human evaluation scores with state-of-the-art approaches for BANS.\",\nisbn=\"978-981-33-4673-4\"\n}\n\n",
