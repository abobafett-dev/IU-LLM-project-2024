[How to Calculate the Heart Rate](https://medium.com/@protobioengineering/heart-analysis-with-python-part-4-calculating-heart-rate-12a651db5c47)\n\n## What is a 12-lead EKG?\nEKGs, or electrocardiograms, measure the heart's function by looking at its electrical activity. The electrical activity in each part of the heart is supposed to happen in a particular order and intensity, creating that classic \"heartbeat\" line (or \"[QRS complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRS_complex)\") you see on monitors in medical TV shows.\n\nThere are a few types of EKGs (4-lead, 5-lead, 12-lead, etc.), which give us varying detail about the heart. A 12-lead is one of the most detailed types of EKGs, as it allows us to get 12 different outputs or graphs, all looking at different, specific parts of the heart muscles.\n\nThis dataset only publishes two leads from each patient's 12-lead EKG, since that is all that the original MIT-BIH database provided.\n\n## What does each part of the QRS complex mean?\n\nCheck out [Ninja Nerd's EKG Basics tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNN30YHsJw0) to understand what each part of the QRS complex (or heartbeat) means from an electrical standpoint.\n\n## Filenames\nEach file's name is the ID of the patient (except for 201 and 202, which are the same person).\n\n## Columns\n* index\n* calculated elapsed milliseconds (`index / 360 * 1000`)\n* the first lead\n* the second lead\n\nThe two leads are often lead **MLII** and another lead such as **V1**, **V2**, or **V5**, though some datasets do not use MLII at all. **MLII** is the lead most often associated with the classic [**QRS Complex**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRS_complex) (the medical name for a single heartbeat).\n\nMilliseconds were calculated and added as a secondary index to each dataset. Calculations were made by dividing the `index` by `360` Hz then multiplying by `1000`. The original index was preserved, since the calculation of milliseconds as digital signals processing (e.g. filtering) occurs may cause issues with the correlation and merging of data. You are encouraged to try whichever index is most suitable for your analysis and/or recalculate a time index with Pandas' `to_timedelta()`.\n\n## Patient information\nInfo about [each of the 47 patients is available here](https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/html/mitdbdir/records.htm), including age, gender, medications, diagnoses, etc.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nPhysionet has some [online tutorials and tips](https://physionet.org/about/tutorial/) for analyzing EKGs and other time series / digital signals.\n\nCheck out [our notebook for opening and visualizing the data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/protobioengineering/getting-started-visualizing-patient-100-s-ecg).\n\n\n## How the CSVs were obtained\nA write-up on how the data was converted from `.dat` to `.csv` files is [available on Medium.com](https://medium.com/@protobioengineering/how-to-get-heart-data-from-the-mit-bih-arrhythmia-database-e452d4bf7215).
