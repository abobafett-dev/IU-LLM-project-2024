  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset contains regionalization factors for electricity generation and demand time series in Germany for the years 2019 - 2022. The factors can be used to distribute national generation and demand time series available from SMARD or ENTSO-E  to federal state level. The methods underlying the regionalization factors are described in [1], with a focus on the year 2021. However, an extended version of the dataset covering the years 2019-2022 is also included for comprehensive analysis. Moreover, the dataset comprises the corresponding regionalized generation and demand time series at the federal state level of Germany. This time series has been generated using the provided distribution factors for the years 2019-2022 and corresponding generation and demand time series from SMARD [2]. Addtionally, the regionalization methodology for the distributed generation and demand data for the year 2021 has been supplemented with validation data, as described in [1]. This data has been cross-checked against the available SMARD Transmission System Operator (TSO) data. A description of the preprocessing required to obtain the TSO data comparison is provided in a separate .txt file.

The data is pre-processed at NUTS3 level and then undergoes the same methodology as outlined in [1]. The preprocessing steps required to map the installed capacity to the TSO level are explained in the accompanying .txt file. The allocated generation and demand data are aggregated to correspond to the TSO level using a shapefile of mapped regions in Germany that correspond to the TSOs [4].
