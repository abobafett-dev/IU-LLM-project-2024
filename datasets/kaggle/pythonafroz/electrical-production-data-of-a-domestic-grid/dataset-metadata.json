  "descriptionNullable": "Scientific data come from a domestic rooftop PV plant of 4 kW, located at University of La R\u00e9union (-20.90126, 55.48422), in the South-West of Indian Ocean. The electrical data (voltage and current at AC and DC side, produced power and energy, grid frequency) are collected via the PV system's own operating and management module. Solar irradiance data was measured by a pyranometer in the vicinity of the solar panels and at the same tilt (26\u00b0). Ambient and PV module temperature data were measured with two thermocouples.\n\nThe present dataset includes healthy behavior and different types of shading faults, identified and labelled by means of a numeric variable.\n\nThe data streams from each connected device require proper techniques to ensure their persistence. To be able to provide both efficient ingestion and retrieval of these time series collections, the NoSQL database management system InfluxDB has been implemented. The whole dataset can be used for instance for PV modelling, PV plant behavior analysis, PV production forecasting and PV Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) tool development.",
