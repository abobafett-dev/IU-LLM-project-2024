  "descriptionNullable": "###BACKGROUND\n\nThis dataset comprises of heart rate variability (HRV) indices computed from the multimodal SWELL knowledge work (SWELL-KW) dataset for research on stress and user modeling (see. http://cs.ru.nl/~skoldijk/SWELL-KW/Dataset.html).  The SWELL  was collected by researchers at the Institute for Computing and Information Sciences at Radboud University. It is a result of experiments conducted on 25 subjects doing typical office work (for example writing reports, making presentations, reading e-mail and searching for information). The subject went through typical working stressors such as receiving unexpected emails interruptions and pressure to complete their work on time. The experiment recorded various data including computer logging, facial expression, body postures, ECG signal, and skin conductance. The researchers also recorded the\nsubjects\u2019 subjective experience on task load, mental effort, emotion, and perceived stress. Each participant went through three different working conditions:\n\n 1. ***no stress:*** the subjects are allowed to work on the tasks as long as they needed for a maximum\nof 45 minutes but they are not aware of the maximum duration of their tasks.\n 2. ***time pressure:*** during this time, the time to finish the task was reduced to 2/3 of the time the participant took in the neutral condition.\n 3. ***interruption***: the participants received eight\nemails in the middle of their assigned tasks.\nSome emails were relevant to their tasks \u2014and\nthe participant was requested to take specific\nactions\u2014while others were just irrelevant to\ntheir tasks.\n###HRV COMPUTATION\nHRV indices were computed as follows: First, we extracted an inter-beat interval\n(IBI) signal from the peaks of the Electrocardiography (ECG) of each subject. Then, each HRV\nindex is computed on a 5 minutes IBI array. A new IBI sample is appended to the IBI array while the\noldest IBI sample is removed from its beginning. The new resulting IBI array is used to compute\nthe next HRV index. This process is repeated until the end of the entire IBI signal. Unlike other\nHRV computation methods proposed by other researchers \u2014which mostly consist of computing\nHRV on the whole signal\u2014 in our previous studies, we noticed that this approach allows a more\ngranular, detailed and accurate study of how each heartbeat influences the person\u2019s HRV.\n\n###RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION\nThe original dataset contains raw ECG signal and a feature dataset which is annotated with the conditions under which the data was collected. It also contained heart rate variability (HRV) feature (only RMSSD) that was computed every one minute. This limiting and lead to the conclusion that HRV was not a good predictor of office stressor. This dataset is more comprehensive and allows to predict the stressor with a 99.25% accuracy. For more details, refer to our published paper included in this dataset. \n\n### Reference\n1.
