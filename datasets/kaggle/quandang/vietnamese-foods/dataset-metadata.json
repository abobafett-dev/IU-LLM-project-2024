Several machine learning and deep learning image classification techniques have been applied to test the dataset and the results were compared and report. A **decent accuracy of 77.54%** and a high **top 5-accuracy of 96.07%** were achieved. The dataset and the performance comparison of state-of-the-art algorithm tested on the dataset will be useful for ones to develop new food image classification algorithms.\n\n### Implementation process\n1/ Collecting Data: https://github.com/18520339/image-search-downloader\n\n2/ Preprocessing Data:\n- Filtering Similar Images: https://github.com/18520339/finding-similar-images\n- Labeling Tools: https://github.com/18520339/30VNFoods/tree/main/Google%20Sheets\n- Labeling Implement: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d571y_VE7fiWAJMPktZr24knp4Ca-Tu_udGCIlVbzso\n![](https://github.com/18520339/vietnamese-foods/blob/main/Google%20Sheets/demo.png?raw=true)\n\n3/ Model Implement: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/18520339/30VNFoods/tree/main/Model%20Implement\n\n4/ Model Evaluation: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/18520339/30VNFoods/blob/main/Evaluation.ipynb\n\n5/ Deployment: **temporarily inactive** due to the large model exceeding my Git LFS quota.
