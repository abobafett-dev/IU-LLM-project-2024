  "descriptionNullable": "The **\"People - Segmentation\"** dataset is a high-quality polygon annotation dataset containing **1000** publicly available images of people in various settings and environments. The dataset comprises a total of **1035 labels across one class**, capturing people in different poses, expressions, and backgrounds. It is released under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license, providing researchers, data scientists, and enthusiasts with the ability to gain valuable insights into human activities and enabling object-level understanding. This makes it an indispensable tool for a range of applications, including but not limited to object detection, facial recognition, and human-computer interaction systems. With annotations, researchers can analyze and gain insights into the development of accurate person detection algorithms.\n\nDataset Name - People - Segmentation\nData Asset Type - Image\nData Asset Volume - 1000 images\nData Asset Content - People in various settings and environments\nData Asset Source - Publicly available on the web\nAnnotation Type - Polygon\nAnnotation Format - COCO\nPlatform Used - Supervisely\n\nThis dataset is created by Quantigo AI, as a part of our commitment towards advancing the fields of AI and machine learning.
