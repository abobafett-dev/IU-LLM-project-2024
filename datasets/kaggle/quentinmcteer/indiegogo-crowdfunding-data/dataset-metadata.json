Note that it is not a complete compilation of all Indiegogo campaigns during this time frame, just a sample. Using the original data, I created features by month, category, and country/geography. Additionally, I added a 'state' column that indicates whether or not the campaign was fully funded (i.e. was successful in achieving its goal). Finally, there are many other characteristic columns that qualify that type of campaign, including text data describing each Indiegogo project.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis csv was created using publicly available data housed under WebRobots.io. Web Robots is an IT firm based in Lithuania that is working on next-generation web crawling technologies. The Indiegogo data posted here is a cleaned-up version of an early 2021 Indiegogo web scraping project that the company put together. You can find a link to their original JSON files here: https://webrobots.io/indiegogo-dataset/\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to the amazing Redditors that pointed me to Web Robots, the organization is doing great work at the forefront of data collection and web scraping. \n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nWould love to see some cool EDA that breaks down the data by category, geography, and time (year, month, day). Also, it wouldn't be Kaggle data if you couldn't build a model. I would enjoy seeing some attempts to predict the likelihood of campaign success, similar to what is done with the popular Kickstarter dataset on this platform. Finally, I would like to see some NLP analysis done using the text data that describes each Indiegogo campaign in the dataset.",
