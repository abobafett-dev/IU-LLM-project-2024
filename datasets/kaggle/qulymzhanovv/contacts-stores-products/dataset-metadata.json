  "descriptionNullable": "**Contacts Dataset**\nThe Contacts dataset simulates a list of individual contacts with detailed personal and contact information, useful for representing a customer database:\n\nID: A unique identifier for each contact, generated as a UUID.\nEmail: A randomly generated realistic email address.\nCountry: Randomly chosen from a list of six countries (France, US, UK, Germany, Portugal, China), represented by their respective codes.\nCity: A random city, ideally from the chosen country, although this script uses a random city generator without specific country linkage for simplicity.\nPhone: A randomly generated phone number, which should ideally include the country prefix (not implemented in this simple version).\nFirstname: A randomly generated first name.\nBirthdate: A randomly generated birth date for each contact, ranging from 1930 to 2008, making the age of contacts between 15 and 93.\nPostal Code: A postal code corresponding to the randomly chosen city.\nAcquisition Source: The source through which the contact was acquired, chosen randomly from options like Facebook ad, Google ad, promotional email, or a birthday mail campaign.\nCreated At: The timestamp when the contact record was created, ranging from 2019 to the present.\nUpdated At: The timestamp of the last update to the contact record, which is any time between the creation date and the current date.\n\n\n\n**Products Dataset**\nThe Products dataset simulates an inventory of items that might be sold by a company:\n\nID: A unique identifier for each product, generated as a UUID.\nSKU: A unique Stock Keeping Unit code for each product.\nCategories: A list of categories assigned to each product, chosen from predefined options like Electronics, Clothing, Home, Toys, Books. Each product can belong to multiple categories.\nPrice: A randomly generated price for each product, ranging from $10 to $500.\nName: A randomly generated name for the product.\nDescription: A short description for the product, generated randomly.\nParent ID: The ID of a parent product if the current product is a variant; this is left blank in the script for simplicity.\nURL: A fake URL simulating a product page on an e-commerce site.\nImage URL: A fake URL for the product\u2019s image.\nBrand: The brand of the product, either randomly selected from a list or generated.\nCreated At: The timestamp when the product record was created, within the last two years.\nModified At: The timestamp of the last update to the product record.\n\n\n**Stores Dataset**\nThe Stores dataset represents physical or conceptual locations where the company operates:\n\nID: A unique identifier for each store, generated as a UUID.\nName: The name of the store, generated by appending \"Store\" to a randomly generated company name.\nCity: The city where the store is located, chosen randomly.\nCountry: The country where the store is located, chosen randomly.\nPostal Code: A postal code for the store, generated randomly.\nCreated At: The timestamp when the store record was created, within the last two years.\nModified At: The timestamp of the last update to the store record.\n\n\nThese datasets can be used individually or combined to simulate real-world business applications like customer relationship management, inventory tracking, and retail operations. If you need these datasets linked (e.g., linking products to stores, or contacts to purchases), additional scripting would be needed to establish these relationships within the data.",
