  "descriptionNullable": "\n\n### Description\nThis dataset consists of images representing the Arabic Alphabet in sign language, with the background removed to focus solely on the hand gestures. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of machine learning models for recognizing Arabic sign language, which can significantly improve communication for the hearing-impaired within the Arabic-speaking community.\n\n### Dataset Information\n\n- **Number of images**: 6985\n- **Original number of images**: 7856\n- **Image resolution**: Originally 5432 x 3830 pixels, resized to 224 x 224 pixels\n- **Format**: RGB images\n- **Classes**: 31 (representing the Arabic alphabet)\n- **File Structure**: Organized in folders by class\n\n### Dataset Distribuion\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F17372370%2Fd10f204b7affdee4f698b96188ffc1db%2FDistribution%20of%20data.png?generation=1716060833437519&alt=media)\n\n\n\n\n### Data Collection\n- **Source of the dataset**: You can find the original dataset (RGB Arabic Alphabets Sign Language DatasetAASL) with the backgrounds\n Here :  [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadalbrham/rgb-arabic-alphabets-sign-language-dataset).\n- **Participants**: More than 200 participants\n- **Collection method**: Images were collected using various digital cameras and smartphones. Participants were asked to perform the sign language gestures for each letter of the Arabic alphabet.\n- **Environment**: Images were taken in various lighting conditions and backgrounds, which were later removed.\n\n### Data Preprocessing\n- **Background Removal**: Backgrounds of images were removed using image processing techniques to reduce noise and improve the training efficiency of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.\n- **Data Cleaning**: Misclassified and unclear images were reclassified or removed. This process reduced the dataset from 7856 to 6985 images.\n- **Data Resizing**: All images were resized from their original resolution to 224 x 224 pixels to standardize input dimensions for the CNN model.\n\n### Sample Images\nThis is a sample from your dataset showing hand gestures with the background removed: \n\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F17372370%2Fa2e5f22e81937151a36db3477d74cb77%2FWith%20and%20without%20backgound.png?generation=1716060691283986&alt=media)\n\n### Usage\nThis dataset can be used to train deep learning models for recognizing Arabic Alphabet sign language gestures. The provided data augmentation techniques and preprocessing steps can help improve model accuracy and generalization.\n\n### Dataset Statistics\n- **Class Distribution**: Equal distribution across all 31 classes\n- **Image Format**: PNG or JPEG\n- **Average Image Size**: 224 x 224 pixels\n- **Color Channels**: 3 (RGB)\n\n\n\n### Citation\nIf you use this dataset in your research, please cite the following paper:\nEl Kharoua, R., & Jiang, X.M.
