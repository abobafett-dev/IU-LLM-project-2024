The data were recored from ten subjects under three different conditions: normal (unbraced) walking on a treadmill, walking on a treadmill with a knee-brace on the right knee, and walking on a treadmill with an ankle brace on the right ankle. For each subject in each condition, ten consecutive gait cycles (replications) are included, where each gait cycle starts and ends at heel-strike. For each gait cycle, the data were normalized to consist of 101 time points representing 0%,\u2026,100% of the gait cycle. Six joint angles are included, which comprise all combinations of leg (left and right) and joint (ankle, knee, hip). The data were collected at the Human Dynamics and Controls Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Details of the experimental setup can be found in Shorter et al. (2008).

A common approach to analyzing cyclic biomechanical data involves averaging the biomechanical signals across cycle replications, and then comparing mean differences at specific points of the cycle. This pointwise analysis approach ignores the functional nature of the data, which can hinder one\u05f3s ability to find subtle differences between experimental conditions and/or subject populations. To overcome this limitation, we propose using mixed-effects smoothing spline analysis of variance (SSANOVA) to analyze differences in cyclic biomechanical data. The SSANOVA framework makes it possible to decompose the estimated function into the portion that is common across groups (i.e., the average cycle, AC) and the portion that differs across groups (i.e., the contrast cycle, CC). By partitioning the signal in such a manner, we can obtain estimates of the CC differences (CCDs), which are the functions directly describing group differences in the cyclic biomechanical data. Using both simulated and experimental data, we illustrate the benefits of using SSANOVA models to analyze differences in noisy biomechanical (gait) signals collected from multiple locations (joints) of subjects participating in different experimental conditions. Using Bayesian confidence intervals, the SSANOVA results can be used in clinical and research settings to reliably quantify biomechanical differences between experimental conditions and/or subject populations.\n",
