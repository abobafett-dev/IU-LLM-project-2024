It comprises multivariate, sequential, time-series, and textual features, including invoice numbers, product codes, descriptions, quantities, prices, customer IDs, and countries. This dataset is valuable for data scientists due to its richness and complexity, offering opportunities for a wide array of analytical tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering. By analyzing this data, data scientists can uncover patterns in customer behavior, identify trends in product sales, optimize pricing strategies, predict future sales, segment customers for targeted marketing, detect anomalies or fraudulent activities, and ultimately enhance business decision-making processes. Moreover, the sequential nature of the data allows for the exploration of temporal dependencies and the development of predictive models that capture the dynamics of retail transactions over time. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for studying online retail operations and informing data-driven strategies to improve business performance and customer satisfaction.\n\n\n**Dataset Name:** Online Retail II\n\n**Dataset Characteristics:** \n- Multivariate\n- Sequential\n- Time-Series\n- Text\n\n**Subject Area:** Business\n\n**Associated Tasks:**\n- Classification\n- Regression\n- Clustering\n\n**Feature Types:** \n- Integer\n- Real\n\n**Number of Instances:** 1,067,371\n\n**Features:**\n- InvoiceNo: Invoice number.

Product price per unit in sterling (\u00a3).\n- CustomerID: Customer number. Nominal. A 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.\n- Country: Country name. Nominal. The name of the country where a customer resides.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The dataset contains all transactions for a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011.\n- The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gift-ware.\n- Many customers of the company are wholesalers.\n\n**Missing Values:** Yes\n\n",
