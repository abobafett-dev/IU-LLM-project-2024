It's pretty useful for experimenting.\n\n## General info\n* Each image is of size 640x640px, natural size no stretching or shrinking. \n* Labels are manually double checked, a lot of labeling mistakes were fixed.\n* Not balanced due to the natural frequency of signs. (crosswalks are everywhere)\n* Contains images with no labels, mostly of False Positive detections.\nNOTE (20-02-24): Update to version 2. Added 2k new images and double checked the labels for mistakes.\n\nI appreciate any feedback, ideas or whatever you have to say, It's my first dataset and I'm trying to make it as good as I can. I'll probably add more classes in the future, there are a lot of unlabeled traffic signs present in the existing data.",
