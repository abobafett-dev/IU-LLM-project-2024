These nine states, which account for about 48 percent of the total population, 59 percent of Births, 70 percent of Infant Deaths, 75 percent of Under 5 Deaths and 62 percent of Maternal Deaths in the country, are the high focus States in view of their relatively higher fertility and mortality. \n\nA representative sample of about 21 million population and 4.32 million households were covered 20k+ sample units which is spread across rural and urban area of these 9 states.\n\n&gt;The objective of the AHS is to yield a comprehensive, representative and reliable dataset on core vital indicators including composite ones like Infant Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Ratio and Total Fertility Rate along with their co-variates (process and outcome indicators) at the district level and map the changes therein on an annual basis. These benchmarks would help in better and holistic understanding and timely monitoring of various determinants on well-being and health of population particularly Reproductive and Child Health.
