This is done through analyzing both price and volume. The MFI's calculation generates a value that is then plotted as a line that moves within a range of 0-100, making it an oscillator.\ncci_oscillator - he Commodity Channel Index\u200b (CCI) is a momentum-based oscillator used to help determine when an investment vehicle is reaching a condition of being overbought or oversold.\nwilliam_%r - Williams %R, also known as the Williams Percent Range, is a type of momentum indicator that moves between 0 and -100 and measures overbought and oversold levels. \nbollinger_upper_band - Upper line defines resistance\nmiddle_band - Middle line defines trend\nbollinger_lower_band - Lower line defines support\nstochastic_slow_k - The slow stochastic indicator is a technical momentum indicator that aims to measure the trend in prices and identify trend reversals.\nstochastic_slow_d - The slow stochastic indicator is a technical momentum indicator that aims to measure the trend in prices and identify trend reversals.\n\n",
