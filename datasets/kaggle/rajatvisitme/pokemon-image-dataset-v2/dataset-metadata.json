  "descriptionNullable": "# About\nThis dataset is a modified version of the Pokemon Image Dataset.\n\n## Why was modification necessary?\nThe modification involved augmentation. Why? Because it was observed that several GAN architectures were unable to learn the patterns of the Pokemon. This difficulty could be attributed to the fact that Pokemons come in various shapes and sizes. Furthermore, most Pokemons in the dataset only had a single image available (except for a few). As a result, 10 additional images were generated for each Pokemon using data augmentation techniques.\n\n## How was it done?\nThe code for this modification can be found on GitHub: [PokeGAN_v2.ipynb](https://github.com/rajatvisitme/PokeGAN/blob/main/PokeGAN_v2.ipynb)\n\n# Content\nOriginal: 819 Pokemon images with a white background in JPG format (size 256x256).\nAugmented: 8183 Pokemon images with a white background in JPG format (size 256x256).\nTotal: 9002\n\n# Acknowledgements\nOriginal dataset: [Pokemon Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset).\nMost of the original Pokemon images collected from: https://veekun.com/dex/downloads\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F3479088%2F325431edd5195d950b6fe5a8f9b3a346%2FScreenshot%20Pokemons%20Augmented.png?generation=1689355030044934&alt=media)",
