Now it's super easy for anyone to get the latest dataset (Just use a single command), so in case you need bleeding-edge data, or you want to see the code, you can look [here](https://github.com/WarrierRajeev/UFC-Predictions). Hope this solves all problems!\nIf there are any issues with the data, please forgive me and write about it in the comments or raise an issue on github. I will pick it up \ud83d\udc4d \nThank you everyone for the emails and messages. As usual, have fun! \u2764\ufe0f  \ud83d\ude01 \n\n### Context\n\nThis is a list of every UFC fight in the history of the organisation. Every row contains information about both fighters, fight details and the winner. The data was scraped from ufcstats website. After fightmetric ceased to exist, this came into picture. I saw that there was a lot of information on the website about every fight and every event and there were no existing ways of capturing all this. I used beautifulsoup to scrape the data and pandas to process it. It was a long and arduous process, please forgive any mistakes. I have provided the raw files incase anybody wants to process it differently. This is my first time creating a dataset, any suggestions and corrections are welcome! Incase anyone wants to check out the work, I have all uploaded all the code files, including the scraping module [here](https://github.com/WarrierRajeev/UFC-Predictions)\n\nHave fun!\n\n### Content\n\nEach row is a compilation of both fighter stats. Fighters are represented by 'red' and 'blue' (for red and blue corner). So for instance, red fighter has the complied average stats of all the fights except the current one. The stats include damage done by the red fighter on the opponent and the damage done by the opponent on the fighter (represented by 'opp' in the columns) in all the fights this particular red fighter has had, except this one as it has not occured yet (in the data). Same information exists for blue fighter. The target variable is 'Winner' which is the only column that tells you what happened.\nHere are some column definitions:\n\n### Column definitions:\n\n- `R_` and `B_` prefix signifies red and blue corner fighter stats respectively\n- `_opp_` containing columns is the average of damage done by the opponent on the fighter\n- `KD` is number of knockdowns\n- `SIG_STR` is no. of significant strikes 'landed of attempted'\n- `SIG_STR_pct` is significant strikes percentage\n- `TOTAL_STR` is total strikes 'landed of attempted'\n- `TD` is no. of takedowns\n- `TD_pct` is takedown percentages\n- `SUB_ATT` is no. of submission attempts\n- `PASS` is no. times the guard was passed?\n- `REV` is the no. of Reversals landed\n- `HEAD` is no. of significant strinks to the head 'landed of attempted'\n- `BODY` is no. of significant strikes to the body 'landed of attempted'\n- `CLINCH` is no. of significant strikes in the clinch 'landed of attempted'\n- `GROUND` is no. of significant strikes on the ground 'landed of attempted'\n- `win_by` is method of win\n- `last_round` is last round of the fight (ex. if it was a KO in 1st, then this will be 1)\n- `last_round_time` is when the fight ended in the last round\n- `Format` is the format of the fight (3 rounds, 5 rounds etc.)\n- `Referee` is the name of the Ref\n- `date` is the date of the fight\n- `location` is the location in which the event took place\n- `Fight_type` is which weight class and whether it's a title bout or not\n- `Winner` is the winner of the fight\n- `Stance` is the stance of the fighter (orthodox, southpaw, etc.)\n- `Height_cms` is the height in centimeter\n- `Reach_cms` is the reach of the fighter (arm span) in centimeter\n- `Weight_lbs` is the weight of the fighter in pounds (lbs)\n- `age` is the age of the fighter\n- `title_bout` Boolean value of whether it is title fight or not\n- `weight_class` is which weight class the fight is in (Bantamweight, heavyweight, Women's flyweight, etc.)\n- `no_of_rounds` is the number of rounds the fight was scheduled for\n- `current_lose_streak` is the count of current concurrent losses of the fighter\n- `current_win_streak` is the count of current concurrent wins of the fighter\n- `draw` is the number of draws in the fighter's ufc career\n- `wins` is the number of wins in the fighter's ufc career\n- `losses` is the number of losses in the fighter's ufc career\n- `total_rounds_fought` is the average of total rounds fought by the fighter\n- `total_time_fought(seconds)` is the count of total time spent fighting in seconds\n- `total_title_bouts` is the total number of title bouts taken part in by the fighter\n- `win_by_Decision_Majority` is the number of wins by majority judges decision in the fighter's ufc career\n- `win_by_Decision_Split` is the number of wins by split judges decision in the fighter's ufc career\n- `win_by_Decision_Unanimous` is the number of wins by unanimous judges decision in the fighter's ufc career\n- `win_by_KO/TKO` is the number of wins by knockout in the fighter's ufc career\n- `win_by_Submission` is the number of wins by submission in the fighter's ufc career\n- `win_by_TKO_Doctor_Stoppage` is the number of wins by doctor stoppage in the fighter's ufc career\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n- Inspiration: https://github.com/Hitkul/UFC_Fight_Prediction \nProvided ideas on how to store per fight data.
