I have filtered the downloaded data to English and collected every review. A small portion of the dataset is used to label the data manually. The labeling is done to categorize the reviews into four categories:\n\n**Subscription:** Since medium has a subscription option, anything related to users' opinions about subscription features should belong here.\n\n**Content:** Medium is a sharing platform, there are lots of writings from poetry to advanced artificial intelligence research. Users\u2019 opinions about a variety of topics, and the quality of the content should belong here.\n\n**Interface:** Thoughts about UI, searching articles, recommendation engine, and anything related to the interface should belong here. This also includes payment-related issues.\n\n**User Experience:** The user\u2019s general thoughts and opinions about the application. Which should be generally abstract without indicating another category.\n\n~350 samples were used to fine-tune a roBERTa model to classify the reviews, then I used the same model for sentiment analysis (without fine-tuning). \n\nMore detailed information about the data collection can be found in this notebook:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/code/raqhea/automatically-collect-process-and-label-text-data\n\nThe model used for fine-tuning: https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment",
