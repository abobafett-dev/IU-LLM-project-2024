  "descriptionNullable": "This is a corpus of empathetic conversations between counselors and patients. The dataset consists of 38,235 query answers with two more features such as topic, and question title.  In a line, the corpus consists of 4 columns and 38,235 rows. The name of the columns are-\n\n1.  \"Topic\",\n2.  \"Question-Title\",\n3. \"Question\" and\n4. \"Answers\". \n\nAs there are no datasets available of emphatic response in Bengali language, we have created the dataset from some other corpus in other languages such as English, Arabic named counsel-chat and arabic-empathetic-conversations (links given in the related links section) and more importantly, we have generated some more conversations from real counselling conversations from various sources. The selected corpus are publicly available. We have translated the corpus into Bengali and processed the corpus manually into usable such as by removing HTML tags, unusable characters and many more and finally created a noble dataset. According to the author, this is the first and largest corpus of emphatic conversation in Bengali, though it has some limitation. This will help researchers to do research in Bengali text more specifically in researching in mental health.  ",
