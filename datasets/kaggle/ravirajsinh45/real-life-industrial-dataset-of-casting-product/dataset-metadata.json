For removing this defective product all industry have their quality inspection department. But the main problem is this inspection process is carried out manually. It is a very time-consuming process and due to human accuracy, this is not 100% accurate. This can because of the rejection of the whole order. So it creates a big loss in the company.\n\nWe decided to make the inspection process automatic and for this, we need to make deep learning classification model for this problem.\n\n### contain \n\nThese all photos are top view of submersible pump impeller(google search for better understanding).\nThe dataset contains total 7348 image data. These all are the size of (300*300) pixels grey-scaled images. In all images, augmentation already applied.\n\nAlso uploaded images size of 512x512 grayscale. This data set is without Augmentation. This contains 519 ok_front and 781 def_front impeller images. \n\nFor capturing these images requires stable lighting, for this we made a special arrangement.\n\nthere are mainly two categories:-\n1) Defective \n2)Ok\n\nmaking classification model we already split data for training and testing into two folders.\nBoth train and test folder contains def_front and ok_front subfolders.\n\ntrain:- def_front have 3758 and ok_front have 2875 images\ntest:- def_front have:- def_front have 453 and ok_front have 262 images\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe wouldn't be here without the help of PILOT TECHNOCAST, Shapar, Rajkot. we have to thank them for constant support and allowing us to work for this problem.\n\n\n### Prototype\n\nWe also made Working prototype using this dataset.
