After collecting 47000 such raw image files for 47 signs (100 files per sign per user) and generating 47000 corresponding output image files applying MediaPipe, the co-ordinate values of these key-points are stored in a .csv files. This dataset contains 470 such .csv files (collected from 10 users for 47 signs in total). After generating the dataset, we have also done the classification, using different classifiers, such as KNN, SVM, RFC, DTC, Neural Networks etc. Accuracies for different classifiers are yielded in the classification code (in code section).",
