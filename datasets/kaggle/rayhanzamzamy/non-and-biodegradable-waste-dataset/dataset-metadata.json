There is nothing wrong, in terms of waste itself defined as the final product that can no longer be used (by humans); residue. The problem lies in 'how do we manage this waste, while we can't use it anymore?'. Several countries have issues related to waste because the rate of waste production is not comparable to its management efforts. These things can be a big problem for the ecosystem. \n\nWith this dataset. I hope we can help waste management efforts with computer vision technology. With this technology, we can identify, track, sort and process it accordingly. \n\n\n### **Content**\n\nThis dataset contains approximately 256K images (156K original data) representing two classes, Biodegradable and Non-biodegradable. \n- **Biodegradable**, contains materials which can be decomposed naturally by microorganisms, such as foods, plants, fruits, etc. The waste from this material can be processed into compost. \n- **Non-biodegradable**, contains materials that cannot be decomposed naturally, for example plastics, metals, inorganic elements, etc. The waste from this material will be recycled into new materials. \n\nI add augmented data against imbalanced class. Augmented data made by manipulating original data. Image transformation used: horizontal flip, vertical flip, 90deg CW rotation, 90deg CCW rotation.\n\nIn this dataset, I divide the data into two subsets, training set and evaluation set. The training set itself was splitted into 4 parts due to some technical constraints (my internet bandwidth). The thing to know is that the part of the training set don't have a good data distribution. So, don't pass each part directly to your model. Concatenate each part to single dataset. See [Quickstart](https://www.kaggle.com/rayhanzamzamy/quickstart).\n\nData files in this dataset have unique name to prevent them from overwritten theirself when concatenating. Below is filename reference. You will need this for filtering this dataset.\n\n`SUBSET.PART_CLASS_CATEGORY_ID.EXT`\n\n**SUBSET**, the subset where data belong in. Either TEST or TRAIN.\n**PART**, part number of subset. Only if the subset splitted into several parts.\n**CLASS**, the class of data. BIODEG for biodegradable, or NBIODEG for non-biodegradable.\n**CATEGORY**, category of data. ORI for original data, HFL for horizontal flip, VFL for vertical flip, CWR for clockwise rotation, CCW for counter clockwise rotation.\n**ID**, data identification number.\n**EXT**, data extension. Either .jpg or .jpeg.\n\n\n### **Acknowledgements**\n\nIn this part, i would like to give an attribution to several Kaggle's users because without their great work, this dataset would be incomplete.
