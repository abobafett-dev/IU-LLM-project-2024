We were told to train a model that can identify if a picture has a sepia filter or not. As we were not provided any dataset, I decided to create my own so I chose anime pictures because I find them cute :). I wasn't too satisfied with the results as my CNN provided an accuracy of only 90% on the test set and I wonder if somebody can make it work even better than I did. I also find it a beautiful way to try your hands on the first convolutional neuronal network if you are an anime fan like me ^^.\n\n### Content\n\nMy data set contains two folders: one for training and one for testing. In each of these two folders, you have a folder with the real pictures and a folder with the same pictures but with a sepia filter above. I split the data based on classes so that it can be easier in case you decide to read them with keras. \n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nHow far can a small hobby like anime and manga lead you to another step in developing intelligent models?",
