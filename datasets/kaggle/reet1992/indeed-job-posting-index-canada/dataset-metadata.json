Covering seven national markets in the US, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, and Australia, the Indeed Job Postings Index meets one of Hiring Lab\u2019s primary goals: produce high quality and high frequency labor market metrics using Indeed\u2019s proprietary data. \n\nThe primary difference between the Indeed Job Postings Index and the legacy Job Postings Tracker is the level. The Indeed Job Postings Index is set to 100 on February 1, 2020, and this effectively provides a uniform level shift of 100 to the existing Job Postings Tracker across all time points.The Job Postings Tracker measured the percent change in postings from February 1st, 2020. For example, if the Job Postings Tracker were 40%, the corresponding Indeed Job Postings Index on the same date would be 140. Additionally, we are now including year-over-year and month-over-month percent changes in the Indeed Job Postings Index as part of our data portal on hiringlab.org/data and on our GitHub page. Month-over-month changes are calculated as 28 day (4 week) differences to control for day of week.  \n\nAs Covid-19 fades from the global labor market discussion, moving to an index better reflects current economic conditions. The Indeed Job Postings Index allows us to compare job postings more naturally across flexible date ranges as opposed to comparing to the pre-pandemic baseline. It also places Indeed\u2019s job postings metric in a broader class of macroeconomic indexes such as the Case Shiller Index that measures house price appreciation and the Consumer Price Index that measures inflation.\n\nData Schema\nEach market covered by a Hiring Lab economist has a folder in this repo. Each folder contains the following files:\n\naggregate_job_postings_{country_code}.csv This file contains the % change in seasonally-adjusted postings since February 1, 2020 for total job postings and new jobs postings (on Indeed for 7 days or fewer) for that market, as well as non-seasonally adjusted postings since February 1, 2020 for total job postings.\n\njob_postings_by_sector_{country_code}.csv This file contains the % change in seasonally-adjusted postings since February 1, 2020 for occupational sectors for that market. We do not share sectoral data for Ireland.\n\nFor certain markets, we also share subnational job postings trends. In the United States, we provide:\n\nmetro_job_postings_us.csv This file contains the % change in seasonally-adjusted postings since February 1, 2020 for total job postings in US metropolitan areas with a population of at least 500,000 people.\n\nstate_job_postings_us.csv This file contains the % change in seasonally-adjusted postings since February 1, 2020 for total job postings in the US states and the District of Columbia.\n\nIn Canada, we provide:\n\nprovincial_postings_ca.csv This file contains the % change in seasonally-adjusted postings since February 1, 2020 for total job postings in each Canadian provinces.\nIn the United Kingdom, we provide:\n\nregional_postings_gb.csv This file contains the % change in seasonally-adjusted postings since February 1, 2020 for total job postings in each region in the UK.\n\ncity_postings_gb.csv This file contains the % change in seasonally-adjusted postings since February 1, 2020 for total job postings in each city in the UK.\n\nGithub link: [https://github.com/hiring-lab/job_postings_tracker#data-schema](url)\nHiring Lab Link: [https://www.hiringlab.org/2022/12/15/introducing-the-indeed-job-postings-index/](url)\n\n\n",
