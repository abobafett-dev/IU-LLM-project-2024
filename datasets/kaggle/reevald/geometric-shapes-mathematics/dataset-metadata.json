The classification of Geometric Shapes Mathematics was built by Moch. Galang Rivaldo and it is used in the COMPFEST 13 AIC event (August-September, 2021). For more information, please refer to the link [https://github.com/reevald/MathEdu](https://github.com/reevald/MathEdu)\n#### Version 4 (New)\nCollection methodology: using software Processing with Python Mode. To generate a plane shapes like a hand-drawn, the Perlin Noise method is used (More info: [https://github.com/reevald/FlatShapeNet](https://github.com/reevald/FlatShapeNet)). The dataset is used for the educational game [Ariga](https://ariga.profematika.com/).\n\n### DESCRIPTION\nCurrently the dataset (Version 4) is constructed by choosing 8 largest classes : \"Circle\", \"Kite\", \"Parallelogram\", \"Square\", \"Rectangle\", \"Rhombus\", \"Trapezoid\", and \"Triangle\". Each class contains 1,500 training samples, 500 validation samples, and 500 test samples. The total number of training samples is 12,000, validation samples 4,000, and testing 4,000. Each sample is an image measuring (224 x 224 x 3) (RGB).",
