While AMZScout does offer an Excel export service, not only is it locked to their outrageously priced ($27.99+) paid tier but it is also suboptimal for Data Science and ML applications. Not being one to back down from a good old-fashioned web-scraping challenge, I developed a [utility for dumping the data out of the browser](https://github.com/regulad/amzscout-scrape). The data generated isn't perfect, there's far from enough to actually do any major work with it, and generating it takes the better part of a week (good luck not getting IP banned by both AMZScout & Amazon), but it should be more than enough to whet your appetite on some business data.**\n\n### Depreciation Notice\n\nThis dataset is depreciated in favor of the [SmartScout dataset](https://github.com/regulad/smartscout-scrape).
