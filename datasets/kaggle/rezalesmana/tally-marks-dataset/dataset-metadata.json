  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nIn Indonesia, election still employs a very manual voting and counting process. Voters would mark a paper ballot then place it in a box. At the end of the voting period, in each voting station, the ballots are counted manually and the result is recorded in a large form, first with tally marks, than with regular digits after counting finished. In order to get the complete election results, the result form from all voting stations must be manually digitized and recapitulated. Due to the large number of voting stations (for presidential election, there will be more than 800,000 voting stations), this is a very tedious and time consuming process. \n\nNow with practically everybody carrying a camera in their pocket, people -- voting officials, candidate's team, or any interested public members -- like to take photo of the completed forms and share them. This gives the idea is to use handwritten digit recognition techniques to assist with the digitization. However due to varying quality of form photo, relying only on handwritten digits is not optimal. It is therefore desired to also be able to recognize counting result directly from the tally marks. Hence, the need for this tally mark dataset.\n\n### Content\n\nTally mark images in this dataset are taken from a subset of voting result form photos from governor election 2020 which is available to the public from election comittee's website (https://pilkada2020.kpu.go.id/). Around 4000 photos are used as the raw data source, resulting in more than 38,000 tally mark images.\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1D_zxa9npxTWLuC19bmR7V7ytP6oF3wZG)\n\nOriginal forms are aligned to match a form template. Then, each tally mark cell is cropped. The image is then converted to white on black. Preprocessing is then performed to isolated the mark from cell borders which may be included due to imperfect alignment process. The isolated mark is then resized while maintaining aspect ratio to fit 22x28 bounding box. 1-pixel border is then added to bring final image size to 24x30.\n\nIn addition to tally marks from 1 to 5, X (cross) marks which represent blank cells are also included in the dataset. Due to its nature, most tally marks are 5 and X.  To increase the size of the dataset, each tally mark 1 to 4 are flipped horizontally, flipped vertically and rotated 180 degree. The name of each image files has indication of the transformation applied (o=original, h=horizontally flipped, v=vertically flipped, r=rotated).\n\nNote that some images have quality issues such as:\n- The mark looks like a blob. This is either because of low quality of the form photo (blurry or very low contrast) or a thick marker was used to draw the tally mark (or both). This issue is mostly occurs on tally mark 4 or 5.\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Jq_318LEV1pGDxz2QO4anYJS6PAaqox-)\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=12KdgX5JFg5Uo1Q85e0G3lGGCKV2ZvSwd)\n- Some portion of the cell border is still included. As mentioned some preprocessing (with heuristics) was done to remove the borders. But this process is not perfect.\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1FZa2i88Qal6T7CGDxj1kcReJAkhu22RO)\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16H-99YAAEVl3eSE_-AcO9HEeBAKr1i2t)\n\nI did manual filtering to remove the worst samples, but some still slip through. Besides, I'm also conflicted regarding the blobs. If I remove them all, I'm worried the samples will be too perfect, hence will not reflect actual input. So basicaly if the blob is still somewhat recognizable by me, I tend to include it. \n\nAlso note: Since the dataset is saved as JPG images, due to lossy compression, the background is not trully black. Some has non-zero but low (&lt;10) intensity.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nIndonesia Election Committed (KPU - Komisi Pemilihan Umum) -  https://pilkada2020.kpu.go.id/\n\n\n",
