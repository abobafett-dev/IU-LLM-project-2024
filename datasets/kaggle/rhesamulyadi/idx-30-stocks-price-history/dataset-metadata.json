I have decided to upload my very first dataset, in order to learn how to upload dataset in Kaggle, as well as an attempt at giving back to the community.\n\nThis dataset contains historical price data of Indonesia IDX 30 Stocks. As the list keeps changing, I am using the latest information as of the writing of this text (16 March 2022).\nRecent changes include removal of 2 large tobacco companies from the IDX 30, which are HMSP (H.M. Sampoerna), and GGRM (Gudang Garam). \n\nSource of IDX 30 Stocks list:\nhttps://www.kontan.co.id/indeks-idx30\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset consists of 30 csv files. Each csv file contains different stock historical price, with different ticker symbol. The data is obtained using pandas datareader, from Yahoo finance.\n\nAs the list of the IDX 30 companies are everchanging, it might include young companies which has undergone recent IPO (such as Bukalapak with ticker symbol BUKA, an E-commerce startup). Hence, despite the data filter indicating starting time of 2006, different companies have different data starting point.\n\nI chose 2006 as  data starting point in order to capture the 2008 financial crisis in the data, as well as giving some buffer time before the 2008 market crash.\n\n\nCSV file formats are as follows:\n\nIndex: \nDate -  datetime64 datatype, with format of YYYY-MM-DD (eg: 2008-07-21). Data granularity is daily, and the date excludes days where market is closed. (eg: weekends and public holidays)\n\nColumns descriptions (Price in IDR, as you might have noticed from the number of digits):\nHigh - Highest price reached in the day\nLow - Lowest price reached in the day\nOpen - Price of the stock at market open\nClose - Price of the stock at market close\nVolume - Number of stocks traded during the day\nAdj Close - Price of the stock at market close, adjusted (eg: due to stock splits)\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nMy inspiration comes from szrlee which has provided DJIA 30 Stock Time Series. Thank you for the inspiration and sharing of your dataset and how to use pandas datareader.\nLink to his dataset:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/szrlee/stock-time-series-20050101-to-20171231\n\nSpecial thanks to Yahoo finance, creator of Pandas-datareader, Kaggle team.  Lastly, thank you all members of the Kaggle community, who has provided endless inspirations and wealth of knowledge, as well as continually reminding me how dumb and inexperienced I am as a member of this data community. It drives me to improve myself.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nAs I am relatively new to stock trading, and currently only has access to the Indonesian stock market, I would love to see anyone giving insights to how the companies behave in comparison with other stocks in different markets. Please note that even some of the largest stocks in Indonesia are merely penny stocks in other markets such as US. (All Indonesian stocks market cap combined is roughly equals to half of Apple's market cap).\n\n",
