  "descriptionNullable": "We created a new dataset of 112 classes of pill with 4480 images. To simulate the operation of an automatic dispensing utility, we needed a data set with well-defined conditions: a fixed scale (since size can be important information for recognition), a homogeneous background, and two different illumination settings: a diffuse light source from above and alternatively a linear light from a lower elevation on the side to make engravings more visible. These requirements are satisfied in our custom OGYEIv2 data set which can be utilized in use-cases for pill recognition under controlled environments. \n\nAlthough the data is initially partitioned into training, validation, and test sets, it is possible to reorganize the dataset to suit specific experimental requirements, such as segregated test or k-fold cross-validation. \n\nIt is also worth noting that not all pills have information leaflet, since some of the pills in the dataset are dietary supplement. In such cases, we formulated the textual description by ourself.",
