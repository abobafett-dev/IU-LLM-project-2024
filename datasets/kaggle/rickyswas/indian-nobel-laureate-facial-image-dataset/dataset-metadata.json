Class Imbalance from initial raw dataset is sorted out by deploying Upsampling technique on the dataset that does nothing but duplicates images for classes with lesser number of samples. It is \"The Dataset\" to start your journey on Image Classification. Do go through the notebook where it is demonstrated how a classification approach using Supervised Machine Learning.\n\n",
