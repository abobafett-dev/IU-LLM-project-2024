The \"Indian Food Images\" directory contains visual representations of various Indian dishes, with each image file corresponding to a specific food item. Accompanying this directory is the \"List of Indian Foods.txt\" file, which holds detailed descriptions of each food item. Each entry in the text file includes the name of the dish, its type of cuisine (such as South Indian or North Indian), the image filename, preparation time, diet course (e.g., main course, appetizer, dessert), and a brief description highlighting the key ingredients and characteristics. This dataset is ideal for creating a visual and descriptive catalogue of Indian cuisine, useful for culinary studies, recipe databases, or developing a food-related application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
