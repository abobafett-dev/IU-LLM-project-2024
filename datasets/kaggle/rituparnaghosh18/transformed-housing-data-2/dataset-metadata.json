The updation is the creation of dummy variables of certain categorical features for modelling purpose. There are a total of 31 columns, out of which Sale Price can be supposedly taken as a dependent variable. The other variables are different features, locations and date, etc. regarding the houses. Several EDA or regression modelling can be performed in this data after a little polishing and treatment.",
