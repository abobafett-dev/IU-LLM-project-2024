  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nProduct size recommendation and fit prediction are critical in order to improve customers\u2019 shopping experiences and to reduce product return rates. However, modeling customers\u2019 fit feedback is challenging due to its subtle semantics, arising from the subjective evaluation of products and imbalanced label distribution (most of the feedbacks are \"Fit\"). These datasets, which are the only fit related datasets available publically at this time, collected from [ModCloth](https://www.modcloth.com/) and [RentTheRunWay](https://www.renttherunway.com/) could be used to address these challenges to improve the recommendation process.\n\n### Content\n\nFollowing type of information is available in the datasets:\n\n* ```ratings and reviews```\n* ```fit feedback``` (small/fit/large)\n* ```customer/product measurements```\n* ```category information```\n\nPlease refer to file description for more granular details. These datasets are highly sparse, with most products and customers having only a single transaction. Note that, here a \u2018product\u2019 refers to a specific size of a product, as our goal is to predict fitness for associated catalog sizes. Also, since different clothing products use different sizing conventions, we standardize sizes into a single numerical scale preserving the order. Please read the paper for further details.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf you're using this dataset for your work, please cite the following articles:\n\nCitation in text format:\n```\n1.
