However, beyond telling us the qualitative aspects of the item we want to consume, reviews may inevitably contain undesired revelatory information (i.e. 'spoilers') such as the surprising fate of a character in a movie, or identity of a murderer in a crime-suspense movie etc. For users who are interested in consuming the item but are unaware of the critical plot twists, spoilers may decrease the excitement regarding the pleasurable uncertainty and curiosity of media consumption. Therefore, a natural question is how to identify these spoilers in entertainment reviews, so that users can more effectively navigate review platforms.\n\n### Content\nThis dataset is collected from IMDB.
