The main purpose for this is to monitor a common basket of goods for use in consumer price index (CPI) calculations. \n\n\n### Content\n\nThe data is in a long-form, with date, market, product, and price recorded. All prices are in Mongolian Tugriks. As of 2021 the USD to MNT is about 2850 MNT = 1 USD.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset is possible thanks to the hard work of the people of the National Statistics Office of Mongolia.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nOften people choose supermarkets over the open markets (called a \"zakh\"). Mostly this is for convenience, but it is notable how much money people could save by choosing a different market!\n\nThis would be a great dataset for EDA or looking at how prices change over time.
