The data includes product details such as the rating, price, operating system, title, review count, and display size. The original dataset had storage and RAM columns, however, the scraper was unable to extract these values properly, and they are thus excluded from the final version. I am including the original data with the faulty columns in the case someone may find them somewhat useful. \n\n## **Methodology**\nThe data was collected by scraping product listings on Amazon.com using ChatGPT's code interpreter. Around 15 pages of listings have been scraped. Many listings which were unsuccessfully extracted have been removed.
