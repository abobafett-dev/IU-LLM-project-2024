Checkout [this thread](https://twitter.com/ro_laguna_/status/1306757187235196928) on how it began, and [this other](https://twitter.com/ro_laguna_/status/1363159454267670529) with respect to version 6 update process.\n\n### Content\n\nData is splitted in training/testing split, they are independent. However, each split contains several near duplicate images (typicaly, same container from different perspectives or days).
