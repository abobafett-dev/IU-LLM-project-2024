This is especially true for a vaccine developer who has a fairly generic name, multiple HQs etc. This is less true for university institutions which tend to be very geographically fixed.\n\nThe tweets I source have to include COVID-19 along with the vaccine candidate name...unfortunately, some of the vaccine candidates are quite generically named such that they refer to common biological words. Hopefully, in future, especially with more trials, there's an evolution from generic placeholder names to more specific variant names that allows social traffic and news articles around a vaccine to be more easily differentiated. \n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI'd like to thank the WHO for providing this information. \n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI want to track the progress of vaccine candidates in a systematic fashion and try to get as much emerging news or Tweets about vaccines as possible. I might post sporadic updates to the dataset and/or put the script I use to obtain the results on Github going forward. ",
