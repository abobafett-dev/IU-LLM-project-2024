  "descriptionNullable": "COVID-19 pandemic had major challenges to mental health during lockdowns. There have been major economic consequences due to the closure of businesses and job losses. COVID-19 flared up the political environment and also featured phases where elections were held in major populated nations such as USA and India. The administration of vaccines was also seen as a factor to review the strength of governments. These major events during COVID-19 resulted in active social media usage and harnessing the knowledge from the data from platforms such as Twitter can be beneficial for researchers. Hence we provide easy access to tweets from the emergence of COVID-19 capturing major Twitter active countries such as the UK, Brazil, USA, India, Japan, Indonesia, Australia, and Indonesia.\n\nWe note that it is very difficult to extract data from Twitter given restrictions from their apps and it took more than 6 months of our time in this extraction process. \n\n**Technical Details**\n\nThe attached tweets are stretched from March 2020 i.e. from the emergence of COVID-19  capturing major Twitter active countries such as the USA, UK, Brazil, India, Japan, Indonesia, Australia, and Indonesia. The tweets are available in zip folders. The datasets have been hydrated using [hydrator tool](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator). Owing to the time taken in the hydration process, three days per week from March 2020-February 2022 have been extracted. The CSV files contain 'id', 'created_at', 'user_location', 'text'. \n\nIn the case of  India (March 2020 - September 2020), we have followed  a similar extraction process: Rabindra Lamsal, October 13, 2020, \"Tweets Originating from India During COVID-19 Lockdowns\", IEEE Dataport, doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/k8gw-xz18\n\nThe IDs only files have been obtained from Rabindra Lamsal, March 13, 2020, \"Coronavirus (COVID-19) Tweets Dataset\", IEEE Dataport, doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/781w-ef42.\n\n\u2014 Coverage : USA, UK, Brazil, India, Japan, Indonesia, Australia, and Indonesia\n\u2014 Language : English (EN)\n\nDataset usage terms : By using this dataset, you agree to (i) use the content of this dataset and the data generated from the content of this dataset for non-commercial research only, (ii) remain in compliance with Twitter's Policy and (iii) cite this dataset.\n\nPlease contact landejanhavi23(at)gmail(dot)com in case of any queries.
