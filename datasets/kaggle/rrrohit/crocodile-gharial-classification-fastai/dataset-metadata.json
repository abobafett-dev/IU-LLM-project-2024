In their implementation, they used it to extract different types of bears. \n\n\n### Content\n\nThe images are downloaded from DuckDuckGo using fastai's `search_images_ddg`  function. I've created a [repo](https://github.com/garhwalinauna/crocodilia-dataset) to replicate this scraping process.\n\nIn addition to arranging the images in three separate category folders, there is a pandas dataframe called `data.csv` containing the following columns:\n\n1. Image URL\n2. Image local path\n3. Image format: jpg \n4. Crocodilia group: crocodile, alligator, and gharial\n\nIn my code, I have already filtered out the `jpg` format files for the ease of analysis.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nKudos to the **fastai** team for creating a seamless method to extract image data for quick analysis. The notebook from which part of my work is derived can be found [here](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/02_production.ipynb).\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nOn the surface, the problem is a little tricky as differentiating the alligators and crocodiles would be difficult given their similar characteristics. Major visible difference between the two is that the alligator has a wider mouth. Gharial's have a narrow snout so we can observe a distinct feature.\n\nI'm looking for and also will be working on two things primarily: <br>\n1. What is the accuracy with which we can classify the images?\n2. Is it possible to get three classes from unsupervised learning? Or do we get more classes due to even different species of crocodiles such as Nile crocodile and Saltwater crocodile.",
