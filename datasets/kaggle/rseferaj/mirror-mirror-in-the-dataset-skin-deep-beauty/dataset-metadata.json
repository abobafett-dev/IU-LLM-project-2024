  "descriptionNullable": "### Skin Quality Dataset Description\n\n**Overview:**\nThis dataset contains various attributes related to skin quality measurements and facial features of individuals. It includes both demographic information and specific facial metrics that can be used for comparative and analytical studies. The dataset is designed to support research in areas such as dermatology, cosmetic science, and computer vision.\n\n**Columns and Their Descriptions:**\n1. **name**: The name of the individual.\n2. **age**: The perceived age of the individual based on skin quality.\n3. **actual_age**: The actual age of the individual.\n4. **dominant_race**: The dominant race/ethnicity of the individual.\n5. **facerectx**: The x-coordinate of the face rectangle.\n6. **facerecty**: The y-coordinate of the face rectangle.\n7. **facerectwidth**: The width of the face rectangle.\n8. **facerectheight**: The height of the face rectangle.\n9. **facescore**: A score representing the overall quality of the face image.\n10. **ASM**: Angular Second Moment, a texture measure used in image analysis.\n11. **contrast**: The contrast of the skin texture.\n12. **correlation**: The correlation measure of the skin texture.\n13. **variance**: The variance of the skin texture.\n14. **entropy**: The entropy measure of the skin texture.\n15. **kurtosis**: The kurtosis measure of the skin texture.\n16. **activityratio**: The ratio of active areas of the skin.\n17. **skinqualityscore**: A composite score representing the overall skin quality.\n\n**Facial Landmarks:**\nThe dataset includes detailed coordinates for various facial landmarks, such as the positions of the eyes, nose, mouth, and other facial features. These coordinates are specified in pairs for each landmark, indicating their positions in a 2D plane. Examples include:\n- **bottom_lip_7_1, bottom_lip_7_2**: Coordinates for a specific point on the bottom lip.\n- **bottom_lip_8_1, bottom_lip_8_2**: Coordinates for another specific point on the bottom lip.\n\n**Usage:**\nThis dataset is useful for:\n- Analyzing the relationship between perceived and actual age.\n- Studying the effects of different demographic factors on skin quality.\n- Developing and testing algorithms for facial recognition and skin quality assessment.\n- Conducting comparative studies between different racial/ethnic groups and their skin characteristics.\n\nThis dataset can provide valuable insights into the factors influencing skin quality and help develop more effective skin care products and treatments. \n\nHere are the equations:\n\n1. **Image Whitening**:\n    - Apply the whitening procedure to all images to model signal processing before the visual cortex. This involves using a circularly symmetric low-pass filter with the frequency response:\n\n    $$\n    R(f) = fe^{-(f/f_o)}\n    $$\n    where \\( f_o \\) is the cut-off frequency set to 200 cycles/picture.\n\n2. **Whitening Procedure Implementation**:\n    - Implement the whitening filter to attenuate low frequencies and boost high frequencies (except the very highest frequencies). This step helps to decorrelate first- and second-order statistics of the image.\n\n3. **GLCM Features Calculation**\n\nDefine pixel pair distances and angles:\n$$\n\\text{distances} = [1]\n$$\n$$\n\\text{angles} = [0, \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{3\\pi}{4}]\n$$\n\nCalculate the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM):\n$$\n\\text{GLCM} = \\text{graycomatrix}(\\text{image}, \\text{distances}, \\text{angles}, 256, \\text{symmetric=True}, \\text{normed=True})\n$$\n\nExtract features from GLCM:\n\n- **Angular Second Moment (ASM):**\n$$\n\\text{ASM} = \\text{mean}(\\text{graycoprops}(\\text{GLCM}, 'ASM'))\n$$\n\n- **Contrast:**\n$$\n\\text{contrast} = \\text{mean}(\\text{graycoprops}(\\text{GLCM}, 'contrast'))\n$$\n\n- **Entropy:**\n$$\n\\text{entropy} = -\\sum \\text{GLCM} \\cdot \\log_2(\\text{GLCM} + 10^{-10})\n$$\n\n- **Correlation:**\n$$\n\\text{correlation} = \\text{mean}(\\text{graycoprops}(\\text{GLCM}, 'correlation'))\n$$\n\n4. **Compute Kurtosis and Activity Ratio**:\n   - Calculate the kurtosis for each image:\n\n    $$\n    \\text{kurtosis} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{1}{h^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{h^2} \\left( \\frac{a_i - \\bar{a}}{\\sigma(a)} \\right)^4 \\right)\n    $$\n\n5. **Activity Ratio Calculation**:\n    - Calculate the activity ratio for each image:\n\n    $$\n    \\text{activity ratio} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{1}^{n} \\left( \\left( \\frac{1}{h^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{h^2} |a_i| \\right)^2 \\Bigg/ \\left( \\frac{1}{h^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{h^2} a_i^2 \\right) \\right)\n    $$\n\n6. **Compute GLCM Features**:\n    - For each image, compute the GLCM features (ASM, contrast, entropy, correlation) using the `compute_glcm_features` function.\n\n7. **Calculate Skin Quality Score**:\n    - Calculate the skin quality score for each image using the `calculate_skin_quality` function:\n\n    $$\n    \\text{Skin Quality Score} = \\frac{\\text{ASM} + \\text{entropy}}{\\text{contrast} \\times \\text{correlation}}\n    $$",
