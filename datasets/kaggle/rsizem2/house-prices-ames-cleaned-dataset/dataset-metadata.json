  "descriptionNullable": "We provide a processed version of the Ames dataset (`processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`) for the [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition. The goal of this dataset is to minimize repetitive preprocessing for quicker modeling and iterating.  For example code using this data and making a submission to the competition [see this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rsizem2/house-prices-simple-submission). The main changes are as follows:\n\n1. All ordinal categorical data has been encoded as consecutive integers. (e.g. poor = 1, ... , excellent = 5)\n2. When possible fill NAs with reasonable values (e.g. no basement implies 0 square footage)\n3. Remove the 4 outlier values as suggested in the original paper.\n4. Encode `MSSubClass` and `MoSold` as categorical variables.\n5. Manually fix some problem rows\n\nWe provide a second pair of datasets (`new_train.csv` and `new_test.csv`) which include the following changes on top of those previously mentioned:\n\n1. Columns `Alley` and `Street` are dropped for being extremely low variance.\n2. Columns `Exterior1st` and `Exterior2nd` have been combined and one-hot encoded.\n3. Columns `Condition1` and `Condition2` have been combined and one-hot encoded.",
