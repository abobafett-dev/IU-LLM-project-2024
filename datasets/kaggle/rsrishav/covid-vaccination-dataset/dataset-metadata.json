This is counted as a single dose, and may not equal the total number of people vaccinated, depending on the specific dose regime (e.g. people receive multiple doses). If a person receives one dose of the vaccine, this metric goes up by 1. If they receive a second dose, it goes up by 1 again.\n* `total_vaccinations_per_hundred`: `total_vaccinations` per 100 people in the total population of the country.\n* `daily_vaccinations_raw`: daily change in the total number of doses administered. It is only calculated for consecutive days. This is a raw measure provided for data checks and transparency, but we strongly recommend that any analysis on daily vaccination rates be conducted using `daily_vaccinations` instead.\n* `daily_vaccinations`: new doses administered per day (7-day smoothed). For countries that don't report data on a daily basis, we assume that doses changed equally on a daily basis over any periods in which no data was reported. This produces a complete series of daily figures, which is then averaged over a rolling 7-day window. An example of how we perform this calculation can be found [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/issues/333#issuecomment-763015298).\n* `daily_vaccinations_per_million`: `daily_vaccinations` per 1,000,000 people in the total population of the country.\n* `people_vaccinated`: total number of people who received at least one vaccine dose. If a person receives the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine, this metric goes up by 1. If they receive the second dose, the metric stays the same.\n* `people_vaccinated_per_hundred`: `people_vaccinated` per 100 people in the total population of the country.\n* `people_fully_vaccinated`: total number of people who received all doses prescribed by the vaccination protocol. If a person receives the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine, this metric stays the same. If they receive the second dose, the metric goes up by 1.\n* `people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred`: `people_fully_vaccinated` per 100 people in the total population of the country.\n\nNote: for `people_vaccinated` and `people_fully_vaccinated` we are dependent on the necessary data being made available, so we may not be able to make these metrics available for some countries.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThis data collected by [`Our World in Data`](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) which gets updated daily on their Github.\n\n\n### Inspiration\nPossible uses for this dataset could include:\n- Sentiment analysis in a variety of forms\n- Statistical analysis over time\f.\n",
