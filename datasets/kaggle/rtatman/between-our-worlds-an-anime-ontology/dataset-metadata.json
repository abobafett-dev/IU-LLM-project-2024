In computing, linked data (often capitalized as Linked Data) is a method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful through semantic queries. It builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages for human readers, it extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by computers. This enables data from different sources to be connected and queried.\u201d -- [\u201cLinked Open Data\u201d on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data#Linked_open_data)\n\n**Anime**: \u201cAnime is a Japanese term for hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of \"animation\" in Japanese, where this term references all animation. Outside Japan, anime is used to refer specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes.\u201d -- [\u201cAnime\u201d on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime)\n\nThis dataset is a linked open dataset that contains information on 391706 anime titles.\n\n### Content: \n\nThis dataset contains two files. The first is the native [N-Triples format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Triples), which is suitable for tasks. The second is a .csv containing three columns:\n\n* **Anime**: the title of the anime\n* **Concept**: the concept\n* **Value**: the value of the concept for that anime\n\nThe .csv is not a true linked data dataset, since it has removed many of the relevant URL\u2019s.
