(Support Skills are a passive, stackable, team-wide buff.

Defense?\n* What\u2019s the tradeoff between HP and SP?\n* Are some types over- or under-represented?\n* Both the moves and support skills have short text descriptions. Can an NLP analysis reveal underlying clusters of moves?\n* Are different types and attributes evenly represented across stages?",
