It has approximately twenty million native speakers, in addition to 44 million second language speakers. It is written in Thai script (also called the Thai alphabet) which is notable for being the first writing system to incorporate tonal markers. Thai is written without spaces between words.\n\n### Content: \n\nThe HSE Thai Corpus is a corpus of modern texts written in Thai language. The texts, containing in whole 50 million tokens, were collected from various Thai websites (mostly news websites). To make it easier for non-Thai-speakers to comprehend and use texts in the corpus the researchers decided to separate words in each sentence with spaces.\n\nThe data for the corpus was collected by means of Scrapy. To tokenize texts the Pythai module was used. The text in this dataset is encoded in UTF-8.\n\nThe corpus can be searched using a web interface at [this site](http://web-corpora.net/ThaiCorpus/search/?interface_language=en).\n\nThis dataset contains text from two sources: Wikipedia and thaigov.go.th. The former is licensed under a [standard Wikipedia license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License), and the latter under an Open Government License for Thailand, which can be viewed [here](https://data.go.th/TermsAndConditions.aspx) (In Thai).\n\n### Acknowledgements: \n\nThe Thai Corpus was developed by the team of students of HSE School of Linguistics in Moscow under the guidance of professor Boris Orekhov. The team consisted of Grigory Ignatyev, Alexandra Ershova, Anna Kuznetsova, Tatyana Shalganova, Daniil Kolomeytsev and Nikolai Mikulin. The consulting help on Thai language was provided by Nadezhda Motina. Natalia Filippova, Elizaveta Kuzmenko, Tatyana Gavrilova, Elena Krotova, Elmira Mustakimova, Olga Sozinova, Aleksandra Martynova, Maria Sheyanova, Marina Kustova and Julia Badryzlova also contributed to the project.\n\n### Inspiration: \n\n* In this corpus, unlike in most written Thai, words have been separated for you with spaces. Can you remove spaces and write an algorithm to identify word boundaries?",
