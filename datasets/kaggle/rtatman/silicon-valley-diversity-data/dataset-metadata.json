  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion of the ways in which the workforce for Silicon Valley tech companies differs from that of the United States as a whole. In particular, a lot of evidence suggests that tech workers (who tend to be more highly paid than workers in many other professions) are more likely to be white and male. This dataset will allow you to investigate the demographics for 23 Silicon Valley tech companies for yourself.\n\n## Updates!\n\n**NEW June 2018:**\nThe spreadsheet `Distributions_data_2016.csv` contains workforce distributions by job category and race for 177 of the largest tech companies headquartered in Silicon Valley.\n\nEach figure in the dataset represents the percentage of each job category that is made up of employees with a given race/gender combination, and are based on each company's EEO-1 report.\n\nThis dataset was created through a unique collaboration with the [Center for Employment Equity](https://www.umass.edu/eeodatanet/about-us) and [Reveal](https://www.revealnews.org/?p=47103). The equity center provided Reveal with anonymized data for 177 large companies, and Reveal identified companies that have publicly released their data in this anonymized dataset. The equity center and Reveal analyzed the data independently. \n\nFor more information on the data, read our post [here.](https://www.revealnews.org/blog/how-we-created-a-baseline-for-silicon-valleys-diversity-problem)\n\nThe spreadsheet `Reveal_EEO1_for_2016.csv` has been updated to include EEO-1s from companies PayPal, NetApp and Sanmina for 2016. The race and job categories have been modified to ensure consistency across all the datasets.\n\n**NEW April 2018:** The spreadsheet `Tech_sector_diversity_demographics_2016.csv` contains aggregated diversity data for 177 large Silicon Valley tech companies. We calculated averages for the largest race and gender groups across job categories. For information on the aggregated data, read our post [here.](https://www.revealnews.org/blog/the-sound-of-disparity-data-directed-silicon-valley-diversity-choir/)\n\nThis repository also contains EEO-1 reports filed by Silicon Valley tech companies.
