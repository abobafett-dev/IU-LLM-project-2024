My demo can be seen on GitHub: https://github.com/RuiNov1st/InternWork/tree/main/L6_GestureClassification. I use pretrained ResNet18 as base model and obtain its capability to recognize 'thumb up' and 'thumb down' gestures through retraining. The accuracy in the test set can reach 99%. I also take some my own gestures photos for testing, but now the performance is not good.\nAny suggestions will be greatly appreciated! \n",
