  "descriptionNullable": "## **Context:**\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, most of the nation's electricity was generated by natural gas, nuclear energy, and coal in 2020.\n\nElectricity is also produced from renewable sources such as wind, hydropower, solar power, biomass, wind, and geothermal. Together, renewable energy sources generated about 20% of the country's electricity in 2020.\n\nTo produce electricity, a turbine generator set converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. In the cases of natural gas, coal, nuclear fission, biomass, petroleum, geothermal and solar thermal, the heat that is produced is used to create steam, which moves the blades of the turbine. In the cases of wind power and hydropower, turbine blades are moved directly by flowing wind and water, respectively. Solar photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly to electricity using semiconductors.\n\nThe amount of energy produced by each source depends on the mix of fuels and energy sources used in your area. To learn more, see the emissions section. Learn more about electricity production from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration.\n\n## **About the data:**\nThe data is a monthly entry of the net generated electricity from a particular sector in the United States.\n\n## **Acknowledgement:**\nThis data is provided by scraping the website:  https://eia.gov/\nAll credits and rights belong to them.",
