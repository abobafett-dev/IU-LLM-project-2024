Take an example of a supermarket where most of the person buys egg also buys milk and also baking soda. Probably the reason is they want to bake a cake for new year's eve.\n\nSo we can see there is an association between eggs, milk as well as baking soda. Now after knowing such association we simply put all the 3 things together in the shelf and that definitely will increase our sales.\n\nLet\u2019s perform Apriori with the help of an example. ",
