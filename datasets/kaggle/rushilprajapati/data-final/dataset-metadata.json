  "descriptionNullable": "# **Overview**#\nThis dataset is a comprehensive collection of scientific images curated for the advancement of image classification algorithms in the scientific domain. It comprises a diverse set of images across six distinct classes, providing a unique challenge for machine learning enthusiasts and researchers. The base source of the data is derived from the Biofors dataset, with additional images incorporated to enhance variety and complexity. All images are either in .JPG or .PNG formats.\n\n#**Dataset Description**#\nThe dataset is organized into six primary classes, each representing a different aspect of scientific imaging:\n\n**Blot-Gel:** Images of various blotting techniques and gel electrophoresis results used in molecular biology.\n\n**FACS (Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting):**  Flow cytometry images showcasing cell populations based on fluorescent labeling.\n\n**Histopathology:** High-resolution images of tissue sections stained to reveal cellular structures and patterns indicative of pathological states.\n\n**Macroscopy:** Images captured without magnification, highlighting the gross features and details of biological specimens.\n\n**Microscopy:** A collection of microscopic images that reveal the intricate details of cells and microorganisms.\n\n**Non-scientific:** A control group of images unrelated to scientific inquiry, included to test the robustness of classification models. It mainly consists images from ImageNet dataset.\n\n# Use Cases\nThis dataset is ideal for developing and benchmarking image classification models that can be applied to:\n\n**Image Falsification and Fabrication Detection**: This dataset serves as a foundation for developing forensic tools to combat image falsification and fabrication in scientific publications. With the Biofors dataset as a base, participants have the opportunity to create models that can detect unethical manipulations, thereby safeguarding the credibility of scientific research. The challenge lies in identifying subtle alterations that may indicate misconduct, such as duplicated, spliced, or artificially enhanced images. Success in this area has far-reaching implications, potentially preventing the spread of misinformation and preserving the integrity of scientific literature.\n\n**Automated Analysis of Scientific Experiments**:\nThe dataset facilitates the development of models for automated analysis in scientific experiments, which can significantly accelerate the pace of discovery. Automated research workflows, integrating computation, laboratory automation, and AI tools, are transforming how experiments are designed, conducted, and analyzed.\n\n**Diagnostic Tools in Medicine**: In the medical field, diagnostic tools are essential for achieving diagnostic excellence, which involves making correct and timely diagnoses while maximizing patient experience and managing uncertainty. AI in healthcare is revolutionizing diagnostics, from analyzing medical images to identifying disease patterns and predicting patient outcomes.\n\n# References#\n\n[1] https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9710731\n\n[2] https://github.com/vimal-isi-edu/BioFors\n\n[3] https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-53085-2_26\n\n[4] https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2022/05/automated-research-workflows-are-speeding-pace-of-scientific-discovery-new-report-offers-recommendations-to-advance-their-development\n\n[5] https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/tia/data/pannuke (Histopathology images)\n\n[6] https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chopinforest/esophageal-endoscopy-images (Macroscopy)\n\n[7] https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/safurahajiheidari/kidney-stone-images (Macroscopy)\n\n[8] https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alifrahman/covid19-chest-xray-image-dataset (Macroscopy)\n\n[9] https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vitaliykinakh/stable-imagenet1k (Non-scientific images)\n\n[10] https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nodoubttome/skin-cancer9-classesisic (Macroscopy)\n\n[11] https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sunedition/graphs-dataset (Non\u2013scientific images)",
