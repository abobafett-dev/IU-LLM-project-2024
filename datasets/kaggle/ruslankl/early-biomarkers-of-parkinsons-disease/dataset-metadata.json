All patients were scored clinically by a well-trained professional neurologist with experience in movement disorders. All subjects were examined during a single session with a speech specialist. All subjects performed reading of standardized, phonetically-balanced text of 80 words and monologue about their interests, job, family or current activities for approximately 90 seconds.
