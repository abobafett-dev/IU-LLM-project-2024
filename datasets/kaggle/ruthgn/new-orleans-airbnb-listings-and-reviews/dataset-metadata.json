The data set was compiled on November 7, 2021. See the [New Orleans Airbnb data visually here](http://insideairbnb.com/new-orleans/).\n\nSome personally identifying information has been removed from the data uploaded here.\n\n\n### Contents\n\nThe following Airbnb activity is included in this New Orleans data set:\n\nListings, including full descriptions and average review score (`new_orleans_airbnb_listings.csv`)\nReviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments (`reviews.csv`)\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nData credit goes to Murray Cox and [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/behind.html). The original source for this particular New Orleans data can be found [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)--where you can also find information on the different listing ids and their price and availability for different calendar dates (if you're interested in looking at how Airbnb rental listing price fluctuates over time).\n\n\n### Context\n\nThe data set can be used to answer some interesting questions, such as:\n- Can you predict how much a short-term rental in New Orleans should charge per night based on it's location and amenities?\n- Can you describe the vibe of each neighborhood in using listing descriptions?\n- What are the most common amenities to have among short-term rental listings in New Orleans?\n- What elements contribute to a popular or highly-rated listing?\n- Is there any noticeable difference in favorability among different NOLA neighborhood/areas and what could be the reason for it?\n\nFurthermore, it's also important to note that Inside Airbnb (provider of dataset) is a mission driven activist project with the objective to provide data that quantifies the impact of short-term rentals on housing and residential communities; and also provides a platform to support advocacy for policies to protect cities from the impacts of short-term rentals. \n\nAccording to travel guides, New Orleans is one of the top ten most-visited cities in the United States. It was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, which flooded more than 80% of the city, killed more than 1,800 people, and displaced thousands of residents, causing a population decline of over 50%. Since Katrina, major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city's population. Concerns about gentrification, new residents buying property in formerly closely knit communities, and displacement of longtime residents have all been a major discussion topic.\n\nBearing the given context in mind, this data set shared by Inside Airbnb also allows you to ask fundamental questions about Airbnb in any neighbourhood, or across the city as a whole, such as:\n- How many listings are in my neighbourhood and where are they?\n- How many houses and apartments are being rented out frequently to tourists and not to long-term residents?\n- How much are hosts making from renting to tourists (compare that to long-term rentals)?\n- Which hosts are running a business with multiple listings and where they?\n\nThe questions (and their answers) get to the core of the debate for many cities around the world, with Airbnb claiming that their hosts only occasionally rent the homes in which they live. In addition, many city or state legislation or ordinances that address residential housing, short term or vacation rentals, and zoning usually make reference to allowed use, including:\n- how many nights a dwelling is rented per year\n- minimum nights stay\n- whether the host is present\n- how many rooms are being rented in a building\n- the number of occupants allowed in a rental\n- whether the listing is licensed\n\n(Visit their [site](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html) for more details.)",
