Each customer in the database has made a purchase atleast once.The data  represents two years worth of engagement.\n- One can **predict if the customer will make a purchase again** from the audiobook company. \n- The main idea is that the company shouldn't spend its advertising budget targeting individuals who are unlikely to come back. If we can focus our efforts on customers likely to convert again, we can obtain improved sales and profitability figures.\n\n#### Account\n- **Booklength_overall (mins)**\n- **Booklength_avg (mins)** : The average book length is basically the sum divided by the number of purchases\n- **Price_overall** \n- **Price_avg** \n- **Review** : Boolean value for user engagement in the comments section (1: left a feedback, 0: did not leave a feedback). This can be either positive or negative feedback\n- **Review 10/10** : This column has already been worked on with average of reviews (8.91) in place of empty fields (where user did not rate the audiobook). If the Review 10/10 &gt; 8.91, the user has above average \"feelings\" and if less than 8.91, user has below average \"feelings\"\n- **Minutes listened**\n- **Completion** : The total minutes listened divided by the total length of books a person has purchased, assuming people don't re-listen to books\n- **Support requests** : Total number of support requests a person has opened. Support is anything from forgotten password to assistance on using the platform. This is a measure of engagement. It may turn out that the more support a person needed, the more they got fed up with the platform and abandoned it. Or he or she likes it so much that by using it, stumbles upon different issues unlike someone who never opens the app\n- **Last visited minus first purchase** : The bigger the difference, the better. If a person engages regularly with a platform, this difference will be bigger. Thus, the customer is likely to convert again. If the value of this variable is zero, we are sure the customer has never accessed what he has bought or perhaps he did it on the first day only, so it is unlikely he or she will convert again\n- **Targets** : Boolean value, one if a person converted and zero if they didn't. An extra six months of data is taken after the two-year period to check if a user converted. The first two years are contained in the dataset. The next six months will show us if a person converted. In other words, if he or she bought another book. And if that happened, we can count them as a conversion and the target will be one. Otherwise, it is zero.",
