  "descriptionNullable": "The posts were manually annotated all the posts as Suicidal or Non-Suicidal based on the following rules:\n**1. Suicidal Text**\n- Posts that conveyed definite signs of suicidal ideation or even showed signs of suffering extremely from mental health illnesses like depression etc. were marked in this category due to their relation with suicidal intent.\n- Posts that included detailed planning of suicide or asked questions related to committing suicide, for eg. \u201cHello, hypothetically what would be a good way to go without loved ones knowing?\u201d.\n- Posts like \"I weather today is so awful that it makes me want to kill myself hahaha\" were carefully removed.\n- These posts were marked as \u201c1\u201d.\n**2. Non Suicidal Text**\n- Posts that did not have anything related to suicide or self-harm were marked in this category.\n- Posts that used words related to suicide or self-harm in the context of news or information.\n- Posts that talked about suicide of some other person at some other time.  \n- These posts were marked as \u201c0\u201d. This was the default category.\n\nOur annotators included one university professor and three university students who were very carefully instructed on how to annotate each post. The instructions are given below:\n1. Select only one of the two categories mentioned above.\n2. To select the default category in case of any doubt.\n3. To remove any ambiguous posts which seemed very confusing after discussing with other annotators.\n3. Maximum 100-200 posts were to be annotated in one session to avoid any mental fatigue. \n4. Since the majority of posts in the dataset were extremely long (with words &gt; 1000), a maximum of two annotation sessions were allowed in a day.\n\nOnce the annotators completed their tasks, they were divided into pairs of two where they verified the annotations of the other annotator. Any disagreement was carefully resolved and the final annotation was mutually agreed upon by the pair. This helped in validating each annotation. \n",
