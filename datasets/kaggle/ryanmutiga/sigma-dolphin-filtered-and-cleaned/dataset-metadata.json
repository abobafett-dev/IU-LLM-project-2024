This was used as an effort towards taking part in the AI Mathematical Olympiad - Progress Prize 1 (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-mathematical-olympiad-prize/overview). The dataset was processed using TF-IDF vectorisation and K-means clustering, specifically targeting questions relevant to the AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) and AMC 12 (American Mathematics Competitions).\n\n#### Context\nThe Sigma Dolphin dataset is a project initiated by Microsoft Research Asia, aimed at building an intelligent system with natural language understanding and reasoning capacities to automatically solve maths word problems written in natural language. This project began in early 2013, and the dataset includes maths word problems from various sources, including community question-answering sites like Yahoo! Answers.\n\n#### Source and Original Dataset Details\n- **Original Dataset:** Sigma Dolphin (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/sigmadolphin)\n- **Original Source:** https://msropendata.com/datasets/f0e63bb3-717a-4a53-aa79-da339b0d7992\n- **Project Page:** http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dolphin/\n- **References:**\n  - Shuming Shi, et al. \"Automatically Solving Number Word Problems by Semantic Parsing and Reasoning.\" EMNLP 2015.\n  - Danqing Huang, et al. \"How Well Do Computers Solve Math Word Problems? Large-Scale Dataset Construction and Evaluation.\" ACL 2016.\n  - JSON: http://json.org/\n\n#### Content\nThe filtered dataset includes problems that are relevant for preparing for maths competitions such as AIME and AMC. The data is structured to facilitate the training and evaluation of AI models aimed at solving these types of problems. \n\n#### Datasets:\nThere are several filtered versions of the dataset based on different similarity thresholds (0.3 and 0.5). These thresholds were used to determine the relevance of problems from the original Sigma Dolphin dataset to the AIME and AMC problems.\n\n1. **Number Word Problems Filtered at 0.3 Threshold:**\n   - File: `number_word_test_filtered_0.3_Threshold.csv`\n   - Description: Contains problems filtered with a similarity threshold of 0.3, ensuring moderate relevance to AIME and AMC 12 problems.\n\n2. **Number Word Problems Filtered at 0.5 Threshold:**\n   - File: `number_word_std.test_filtered_0.5_Threshold.csv`\n   - Description: Contains problems filtered with a higher similarity threshold of 0.5, ensuring higher relevance to AIME and AMC 12 problems.\n\n3. **Filtered Number Word Problems 2 at 0.3 Threshold:**\n   - File: `filtered_number_word_problems2_Threshold.csv`\n   - Description: Another set of problems filtered at a 0.3 similarity threshold.\n\n4. **Filtered Number Word Problems 2 at 0.5 Threshold:**\n   - File: `filtered_number_word_problems_Threshold.csv`\n   - Description: Another set of problems filtered at a 0.5 similarity threshold.\n\n#### Why Different Similarity Thresholds?\nDifferent similarity thresholds (0.3 and 0.5) are used to provide flexibility in selecting problems based on their relevance to AIME and AMC problems. A lower threshold (0.3) includes a broader range of problems, ensuring a diverse set of questions, while a higher threshold (0.5) focuses on problems with stronger relevance, offering a more targeted and precise dataset. This allows users to choose the level of specificity that best fits their needs.\n\nFor a detailed explanation of the preprocessing and filtering process, please refer to the [Sigma Dolphin Filtered & Cleaned Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanmutiga/sigma-dolphin-filtered-cleaned-notebook).\n\n#### Acknowledgements\nWe extend our gratitude to all the original authors of the Sigma Dolphin dataset and the creators of the AIME and AMC problems. This project leverages the work of numerous researchers and datasets to build a comprehensive resource for AI-based problem solving in mathematics.\n\n#### Usage\nThis dataset is intended for research and educational purposes. It can be used to train AI models for natural language processing and problem-solving tasks, specifically targeting maths word problems in competitive environments like AIME and AMC.\n\n#### Licensing\nThis dataset is shared under the Computational Use of Data Agreement v1.0.\n\n---\n\nThis description provides an extensive overview of the dataset, its sources, contents, and usage. If any specific details or additional sections are needed, please let me know!",
