  "descriptionNullable": "###Context:\n\nThe provided dataset is extracted from yahoo finance using pandas and yahoo finance library in python. This deals with stock market index of the world best economies. The code generated data from Jan 01, 2003 to Jun 30, 2023 that\u2019s more than 20 years. There are 18 CSV files, dataset is generated for 16 different stock market indices comprising of 7 different countries. Below is the list of countries along with number of indices extracted through yahoo finance library, while two CSV files deals with annualized return and compound annual growth rate (CAGR) has been computed from the extracted data.\n\n###Number of Countries & Index:\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F15657145%2F90ce8a986761636e3edbb49464b304d8%2FNumber%20of%20Index.JPG?generation=1688490342207096&alt=media)\n\n###Content:\n\n####Unit of analysis: Stock Market Index Analysis\n\nThis dataset is useful for research purposes, particularly for conducting comparative analyses involving capital market performance and could be used along with other economic indicators.\n\nThere are 18 distinct CSV files associated with this dataset. First 16 CSV files deals with number of indices and last two CSV file deals with annualized return of each year and CAGR of each index. If data in any column is blank, it portrays that index was launch in later years, for instance: Bse500 (India), this index launch in 2007, so earlier values are blank, similarly China_Top300 index launch in year 2021 so early fields are blank too.\n\nThe extraction process involves applying different criteria, like in 16 CSV files all columns are included, Adj Close is used to calculate annualized return. The algorithm extracts data based on index name (code given by the yahoo finance) according start and end date.\n\nAnnualized return and CAGR has been calculated and illustrated in below image along with machine readable file (CSV) attached to that.\n\nTo extract the data provided in the attachment, various criteria were applied:\n\n1. Content Filtering: The data was filtered based on several attributes, including the index name, start and end date. This filtering process ensured that only relevant data meeting the specified criteria.\n\n2. Collaborative Filtering: Another filtering technique used was collaborative filtering using yahoo finance, which relies on index similarity. This approach involves finding indices that are similar to other index or extended dataset scope to other countries or economies. By leveraging this method, the algorithm identifies and extracts data based on similarities between indices.\n\nIn the last two CSV files, one belongs to annualized return, that was calculated based on the Adj close column and new DataFrame created to store its outcome. Below is the image of annualized returns of all index (if unreadable, machine-readable or CSV format is attached with the dataset).\n\n###Annualized Return:\n \nAs far as annualised rate of return is concerned, most of the time India stock market indices leading, followed by USA, Canada and Japan stock market indices.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F15657145%2F37645bd90623ea79f3708a958013c098%2FAnnualized%20Return.JPG?generation=1688525901452892&alt=media)\n\n###Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR):\n\nThe best performing index based on compound growth is Sensex (India) that comprises of top 30 companies is 15.60%, followed by Nifty500 (India) that is 11.34% and Nasdaq (USA) all is 10.60%.\n\nThe worst performing index is China top300, however this is launch in 2021 (post pandemic), so would not possible to examine at that stage (due to less data availability).
