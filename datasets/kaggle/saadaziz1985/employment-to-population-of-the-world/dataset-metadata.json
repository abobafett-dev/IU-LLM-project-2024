Subjected dataset deals with employment to population ratio from Year 1991 to 2022 comprising of 32 years. Employment to population ratio is the proportion of a country or region population that is employed while 15 years of age and older are generally considered the working-age population (modeled ILO estimate as per Fred).\n\nThis code is useful for research purposes, conducting comparative analyses involving educational and economic indicators. It contains two CSV files, first contains 167 countries and its employment to population ratio from year 1991 to 2022, while second deals with categories, areas and all world countries employment to population ratio. The code generates data based on the current date and is available up until the year 2022.\n\n###Content:\n\n\nThe extraction process involves applying different criteria, including content filtering (such as title, frequency, seasonal adjustment, and unit) and collaborative filtering based on item similarity. For the first CSV file, the algorithm extracts data for each country of the world and assigns corresponding country names to the respective FRED codes using a loop. Similarly, for the second CSV file, data is extracted based on a given query, encompassing different regions, categories and associations along with number of countries associated with each region, category and association.\n\nTo extract the data provided in the attachment, various criteria were applied:\n\n1. Content Filtering: The data was filtered based on several attributes, including the title, frequency, seasonal adjustment, and unit. This filtering process ensured that only relevant data meeting the specified criteria.\n\n2. Collaborative Filtering: Another filtering technique used was collaborative filtering, which relies on item similarity. This approach involves finding data items that are similar or related to the given query. By leveraging this method, the algorithm identifies and extracts data based on similarities between items.\n\nIn the algorithm, the focus is on identifying all countries based on the provided search query. The data extraction process begins by retrieving information specific to employment to population ratio. A loop is then used to assign country name to the respective codes assigned by FRED, facilitating easier data handling and analysis.\n\n###Below are the top five countries with high ratio for the Year 2022:\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F15657145%2Fb2ff3248b6042489697f6235682ee3b2%2FTop%205%20Country.JPG?generation=1689249214890450&alt=media)\n\nA similar approach is applied to the second CSV file.
