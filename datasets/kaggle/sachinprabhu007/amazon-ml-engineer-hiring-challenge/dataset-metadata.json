These are mainly based on the content that you have consumed on their website previously. These are called as Recommendation engine. \n\nNow consider you have been running a start up since last one year and now you have been able to gather some customer data and you want to build a recommendation engine. Based on certain features you have to cluster the customers into two different groups so that you can recommend the correct products based on the customer\u2019s cluster.\n\n#Challenge\n1. Your work is to build a predictive model to predict the category of the customer. You have to predict the column : \u201ccustomer_category\u201d\n2. You need to upload a presentation proposal addressing the following questions:\n     - What are the pros & cons of recommendation by this approach?\n     - Propose an architecture that will work more efficiently when building a recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform\n\n\n\nData Description\nData Files:\n\nTrain.csv : 10378 x 10\n\nTest.csv : 7161 x 9\n\nResults.csv : 7161 x 2\n\nData Description:\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F1623540%2F35f3efb9d1b54e9bc2f8a90cee016898%2F2.PNG?generation=1606564415878423&alt=media)\n\n\n\nSubmission Format \n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F1623540%2F10907448e8f46490709f3204b48cf829%2F3.PNG?generation=1606564446898722&alt=media)\n\n\n\nInstructions\nUpload your predictions in  a .csv format under \u2018Upload your Prediction File\u2019\n\nUpload your source code along with the presentation in a .zip format under \u2018Upload your Source File\u2019\n\n#Evaluation Criteria\nPlease note the evaluation metric for score generation will be macro precision-score\n\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F1623540%2F54b5468950a9873331161518686bce32%2F1.PNG?generation=1606564475111802&alt=media)\n\n\nEvaluation metric for the source code & presentation submitted is as follows:\n\n\nApproach: How well is the problem statement understood and attended to?\n\nCreativity: Depth of Analysis\n\nVisualisations: What features are being presented and how?\n\n\nTotal Score (10+10+10 = 30)",
