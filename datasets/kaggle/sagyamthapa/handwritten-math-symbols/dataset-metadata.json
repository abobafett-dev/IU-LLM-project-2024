The resolution of images were too small usually 32*32 pixels.\n2. The quality of data was not satisfactory. Either too many copies of same image or not enough varieties.\n3. The models trained on such datasets performed poorly in real world scenarios.\n4. Main issue with existing MNIST and CHROME dataset was that resizing images from 400x400 pixels(ideal for writing in canvas) to 32x32 pixels means only around 8% of original data will be given to model. So we cannot expect model to perform well in real world scenarios.\n\nSo, I set out to create my own dataset from scratch. \n\n# Methodology\n\nIf you follow the project link you will see a save button. When the model fails to recognize a symbol I saved the image and added it to the dataset. After multiple iteration of adding new images to dataset and training the model on new dataset, I have created created a model that was fairly good at real world testing. This dataset was used to train the model that you are testing right now.    \n\n# Content\n\nThis dataset contains over 9000 handwritten digits and arithmetic operators.\nTotal no of classes: 16\nDigits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nOperators: Plus Minus Multiplication  Division Decimal Equals\nMost images are of resolution 400x400 pixels. Some may be 155x155. I have resized image to 100x100 for in the [started notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/sagyamthapa/starter-notebook).\nEach class contains about 500 examples.  \n\n# Inspiration\n\nThis dataset was created for training the model for my  [project](http://sagyamthapa.me/Handwritten-Optical-Character-Recognition/) .\n\n# Contact\nEmail me at: sagyamthapa32@gmail.com\nMy website: [sagyamthapa.me](https://sagyamthapa.me/#contact-form)",
