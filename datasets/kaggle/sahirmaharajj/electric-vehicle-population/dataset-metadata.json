A Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) is a vehicle that uses one or more batteries to power an electric motor; uses another fuel, such as gasoline or diesel, to power an internal combustion engine or other propulsion source; and is charged by plugging the vehicle in to an electric power source.\n\nClean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility is based on the fuel requirement and electric-only range requirement as outlined in RCW 82.08.809 and RCW 82.12.809 to be eligible for Alternative Fuel Vehicles retail sales and Washington State use tax exemptions. Sales or leases of these vehicles must occur on or after 8/1/2019 and meet the purchase price requirements to be eligible for Alternative Fuel Vehicles retail sales and Washington State use tax exemptions.\n\nMonthly count of vehicles for a county may change from this report and prior reports.
