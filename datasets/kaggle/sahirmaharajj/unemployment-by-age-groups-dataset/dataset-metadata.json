The age group ranges are as follows; 16-19 ; 20 - 24; 25 - 34; 35 - 44; 45 - 54; 55 -64; 65+. This data is based on a 12-month moving average.\n\nThis dataset is invaluable for data science applications due to its granularity and the historical depth it offers. With detailed monthly data on unemployment rates by age groups, data scientists can perform a myriad of analyses:\n\n- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzing trends over time to forecast future unemployment rates or identify cyclic patterns.\n- **Demographic Analysis**: Understanding which age groups are most affected by unemployment and how this changes through economic conditions.\n- **Geographic Analysis**: Although the dataset currently focuses on California, if similar data is available for other regions, comparisons can be made to understand regional economic differences.\n\nThe dataset can also be merged with other socioeconomic indicators like GDP, education levels, and industry growth metrics to examine broader economic narratives or policy impacts.",
