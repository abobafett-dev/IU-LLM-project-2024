The dataset includes columns for site identification, various physical and chemical water parameters, as well as air temperature and other related metadata.\n\nThis dataset is valuable for environmental data science, providing key metrics for water quality assessment over time and across different locations. It can be used to study the effects of environmental policies, seasonal variations in water quality, or the impact of industrial activities on aquatic ecosystems.\n\nThe following analysis can be performed as a starting point:\n\n- **Time Series Analysis**: Studying how water quality parameters change over time.\n- **Spatial Analysis**: Comparing water quality across different sites to identify areas of concern or interest.\n- **Predictive Modeling**: Using historical data to predict future water quality conditions under various environmental scenarios.\n\n**Reference**: Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge. 2020.
