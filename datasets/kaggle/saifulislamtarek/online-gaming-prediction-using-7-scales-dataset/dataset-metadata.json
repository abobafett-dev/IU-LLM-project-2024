  "descriptionNullable": "Playing video games through the internet can be harmful to your health and wellbeing. Gaming addiction is becoming a concern for young people in Bangladesh. Online gaming has a negative effect on our lives. To make sure that our nation's youth do not develop an addiction to online gaming of any kind, we need to watch over them. To prevent becoming addicted to video games, we must stop playing them. It will be possible to predict the risk of developing a video game addiction using machine learning. After examining pertinent research, books, and online articles, we have a conversation with those who suffer from an addiction to online gaming. Using Lemmen's gaming addiction scale to determine whether a person is addicted or not, we were able to identify some common elements that are associated with gaming addiction. \n#**Data Collection :**\nFor the sake of the research, we decided to collect primary data using google form. While designing the data collection form, we had adopted 7 criteria-based game addiction measurement scale proposed by [1] popularly known as Game Addiction Scale(GAS). These criteria and their associated description are given in the table below: \n** Criterion**---------------**Associated description**\n1)Salience:  Whether the gaming has become the most important event of his life or not\n2)Tolerance: Has he getting involve in playing more and more\n3)Mood Modification:\tDoes his mental condition changes in any way when he plays\n4)Withdrawal: Does he feel bad while not playing\n5)Relapse:\tDoes he feel playing more if he quits somehow\n6)Conflict:\tDoes playing games causes conflicts in his life\n7)Problems:\tDoes he suffer from any kind of problem due to playing \n\nA 5-point Likert scale (Very often, often, sometime, rarely and never) was used to collect data from the users. Based on these data a score was generated for every person to measure whether the person is addicted to playing games or not.\n \nMore details of my paper : DOI :  http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT54827.2022.9984508\n",
