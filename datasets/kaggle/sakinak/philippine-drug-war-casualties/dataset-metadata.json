Since then, thousands of drug suspects have been killed by the police or by masked gunmen. The real number of casualties is contested. This dataset contains information on 2,320 individuals killed in three municipalities in the capital in the first 18 months of the anti-drug campaign. \n\n### Content\nThe Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism collected this information from 23 different sources and visited four communities in Metro Manila to verify. The data here cover the period from July 2016 to December 2017 in the following municipalities: Quezon City, Manila, and Caloocan. There are two types of homicides associated with the drug war: those committed by the police during drug stings and other operations and those killed by unidentified assailants.\n\nFor privacy and safety reasons, this dataset lists each individual killing but does not include names and other information that may identify the victims. The sources of information for each homicide are grouped in six categories: police records, news clips, the Philippine Commission on Human Rights (a government watchdog), human rights organizations, church groups, and others. A check mark indicates that the killing was documented by the source.\n\nNearly 80 percent of these homicides have been recorded in some police document\u2014a spot or incident report, a memo to internal affairs, an entry in a paper or electronic blotter. Nearly 60 percent of the killings have been reported in the news. A small number have been recorded only by churches and human-rights groups.\n\n\n\n",
