With the South African government spending over R22 billion over the past 3 years on pothole repair programs and the Automobile Association(AA) acknowledging more than 5% of road deaths to unmaintained road structure (potholes).\n\n### Content\n\nThe data contains images of streets in South Africa that either have potholes (positive response) or do not (negative response). The data have been split into a test and train set. The training set contains 4,026 images of test set contains 1,650 images.\n\nYour task is to provide the probability that an image contains a pothole. For each unique image ID you should estimate the likelihood that the image contains a pothole, with an estimated probability value between 0 and 1.\n\nGet started on this challenge with this blog by Johnowhitaker.\n\n* train_ids_labels.csv : This dataset contains a list of file names of images labeled as pothole (1) or no pothole (0) that make up the training set, i.e. these are the images on which you should train your model.\n* all_data : This file contains all image files (both test and train)\n* sample_submission.csv : This is an example of what your submission file should look like, including a list of unique image IDs. Your submission file should have all of the Image IDs in this file along with estimates of the corresponding probabilities of observing a pothole. The order of the Image IDs does not matter, but the names need to be correct.\n* test_ids_only.csv : This dataset contains a list of file names of images that are not labeled. This is the test set on which you should apply your model.\n",
