These are: american football, baseball, basketball, billiard ball, bowling ball, cricket ball, football, golf ball, field hockey ball, hockey puck, rugby ball, shuttlecock, table tennis ball, tennis ball and volleyball.\n\nImages were **scraped from google images** and then **manually reviewed** to remove misclassified images (although I might have missed some). Duplicates were removed using a dHash style algorithm. The **train/test split is 80/20**.  \n\nThis is an interesting dataset because **several images are misleading**, e.g. some balls have been painted to look like other balls.
