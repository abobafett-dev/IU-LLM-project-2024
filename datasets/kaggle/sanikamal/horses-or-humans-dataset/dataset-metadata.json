It also contains 527 rendered images of humans in various poses and locations. Emphasis has been taken to ensure the diversity of humans, and to that end, there are both men and women as well as Asian, Black, South Asian, and Caucasians present in the training set. The validation set adds 6 different figures of different gender, race, and poses to ensure breadth of data.\n\n### License\nThe dataset is licensed as a CC By 2.0, free for you to share and adapt for all uses, commercial or non-commercial.
