These images have all been generated using CGI techniques as an experiment in determining if a CGI-based dataset can be used for classification against real images.\n\nNote that all of this data is posed against a white background.\n\nEach image is 300\u00d7300 pixels in 24-bit color\n\n### License\nThe dataset is licensed as a CC By 2.0, free for you to share and adapt for all uses, commercial or non-commercial.
