  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nI was curious to learn if player on-field performance has any significant impact on a player's Transfer Value. This dataset can be used to get further insights into that relation or could be used to gather some interesting performance insights on the top players in the world over the last 4 seasons. i.e. (2017-2021).\n\n### Content\n\nI created a dataset that consists of player information scraped from transfermarkt.co.uk. And then I gathered performance data over the last 4 seasons of these players via fbref.com. Transfer Values are updated as of September 2nd 2021. Performance data only consists of players who played within Europe's Top 5 Leagues -  English Premier League, Italian Serie A, Spanish La Liga, German Bundesliga and French Ligue 1. Any player who did not participate in any of these leagues during one or more seasons in the last four years will have NaN values underneath those respective columns.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nIt would be nice to see if someone could build an accurate model to predict player transfer values with the lowest RMSE. This can be helpful to clubs in the future to identify what factors determine a player's market value.\n",
