An optimum goal is to produce and store just enough to meet current needs with certain par reserves. With adequate data, we can forecast consumer behavior and demands for a specific product or service. With the help of time series analysis, we can recognize patterns and check for any correlation between storage and consumption. It incorporates seasonal fluctuations, consumer habits, and trends. Thus, if modeled adequately, it can predict future behavior from the correlation observed and thus help find its causation, which will help management teams avoid excess stockings and reduce capital investment on standing assets and reserves.",
