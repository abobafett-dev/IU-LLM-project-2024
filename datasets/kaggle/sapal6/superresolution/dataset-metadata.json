Each sub-directory is named after the type of image that it holds. For example, the sub-directory \"trains\" contains images of trains. \n\n## What can this be used for?\nI collected this data to train a model for removing motion blur from images but this data can be used for a wide variety of tasks like super-resolution, multi-label classification etc.\n\n## Whom to thank for?\nThe images in this data are original work of their creators and are available on [pexels](pexels.com).
