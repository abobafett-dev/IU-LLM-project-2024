Data: The data we are using is collected by me from various sources available online, i.e., via Bing search, and familiar-looking traffic signs of other countries are also added to this dataset, and the dataset now has only those signs that are India specific.\n\n3. Features: Some information about the data,\n\nthere are 85 types of traffic signs (this means there are 85 different classes).\nThere is a total of 7210 labeled images in total.\n\nPlans/Improvement\n\nI want to convert it into a self-supervised classification problem.\nAs the probability of some traffic signs being together in a picture is high, so want to convert this existing single-label classification into a multi-label classification.",
