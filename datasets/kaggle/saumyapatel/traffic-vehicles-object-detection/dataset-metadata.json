Then I extracted frames from videos using OpenCV. Drew a box around each object that we want the detector to see and label each box with the object class that we would like the detector to predict.\n\nThere are many labeling tools available online, the one used by us was LabelImg. It is a free, open-source tool for graphically labeling images. It\u2019s written in Python and uses QT for its graphical interface. \n\nThe images were labeled under 7 classes \u2013 Car, Number Plate, Blur Number Plate, Two Wheeler, Auto, Bus, and Truck in YOLOv5 format\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nUse the given dataset in classification problems \nUse CNN and YOLOv5 model to detect the objects labeled in the given dataset",
