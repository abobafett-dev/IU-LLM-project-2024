Now, the objective is to provide the specific block (cropped image) in which the manipulation was performed. It is organized in two directories: training and validation. In each directory there are two sub-directories, one for the original cropped images, and the other for the tampered cropped images. The manipulated region is around the 25% to 75% of the cropped image. This dataset can be used for training and validation machine learning based models for classification of tampered images.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nCastro, Maikol; Ballesteros L, Dora Maria; Renza, Diego (2019), \u201cCG-1050 v2: Original and tampered images \u201d, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/28xhc4kyfp.1\n\n",
