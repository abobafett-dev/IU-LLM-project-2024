Internos is online in a closed university campus via network intranet and serves about 7.000-10.000 users. The dataset is build in a time interval of two years of activity between 04/16 and 04/18.\n\nThe core concept in the platform is the media resource. Media resources have a section. One media resource belongs to only one section and a section has several media resources. There are several types of media resource: Video, Movie, Serial, Audio and Other. Users can post comments and vote for specific media resources. Finally, a user may choose to reproduce a media resource requesting the video frames from the streaming server.\n\nIn total, there are 4394 media resources, 2504763 video requests events, 1866 comments and 14695 votes for the media resources. For each media resource, we create several instances considering the number of video requests in each day after the media publication up to 20 days. Hence, the dataset contains 75782 instances after we removed duplicated records.\n\n\n### Content\n\nFeatures extracted for media popularity forecasting in Internos video transmission platform:\n\nNo. & Name & Type & Description\\\\\n1 & Requests one week & Numerical & Number of requests one week ago.\\\\\n2 & Requests two week & Numerical & Number of requests two weeks ago.\\\\\n3 & Requests one day & Numerical & Number of requests one day ago.\\\\\n4 & Requests two days & Numerical & Number of requests two days ago.\\\\\n5 & Day of week & Ordinal & Day of the week: Monday, Tuesday, etc.\\\\\n6 & Day of month & Ordinal & Day of the month: first, second, etc.\\\\\n7 & Day of year & Ordinal & Day of the year.\\\\\n8 & Month & Ordinal & Number of the month.\\\\\n9 & Comments & Numerical & Number of comments in the publication.\\\\\n10 & Comments in section & Numerical & Number of comments in section for the last week.\\\\\n11 & Publications & Numerical & Number of publications for the last week.\\\\\n12 & Publications in section & Numerical & Number of publications in section for the last week.\\\\\n13 & Votes & Numerical & Number of votes in the publication.\\\\\n14 & Votes in section & Numerical & Number of votes in section for the last week.\\\\\n15 & Days published & Numerical & Number of days since the publication was published.\\\\\n16 & Holidays left & Numerical & Number of days of remaining holidays.\\\\\n17 & Next holidays & Numerical & Number of days until the next holidays.\\\\\n18 & Video type & Nominal & Type of video: video, audio, movie, etc.\\\\\n19 & Requests & Numerical & Number of video requests in the next 24 hours.\\\\\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nRojas Delgado, Jairo (2019), \u201cInternos video popularity forecasting\u201d, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/69g55s83mn.1\n\n",
