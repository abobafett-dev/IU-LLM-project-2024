Number: A unique identifier for each record.\n2. Name: The name of the individual.\n3. %Red Pixel: The percentage of red pixels in the image.\n4. %Green Pixel: The percentage of green pixels in the image.\n5. %Blue Pixel: The percentage of blue pixels in the image.\n6. Hb (Hemoglobin): Hemoglobin level in the blood, measured in grams per deciliter (g/dL). Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body and returns carbon dioxide from the body to the lungs.\n7. Anaemic: A binary indicator of anemia status:\n- Yes: The individual is anemic.\n- No: The individual is not anemic.",
