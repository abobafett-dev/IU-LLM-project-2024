Think a for-fun competition version of the kind of work a sniffer dog does when they're screening luggage at an airport.\n\nDogs competing in NACSW are trained to detect 3 target odors - Birch, Anise and Clove. At the trials, cotton swabs or similar items scented with one or more of these odors are hidden out of view. The dogs must source the locations of the hides and indicate to their handler who reports the find to the judge. If the team correctly sources a hide, they earn points for it. \n\nTeams work in diverse environments (referred to as **elements**) searching for hides in indoor locations, outdoor locations, on vehicles and in containers. The number of hides, search area sizes and complexity of the scent puzzles the teams encounter increases with increasing levels of competition. At higher levels of competition teams also encounter unknown number of hides including unknown no hides (blank areas).\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset that was analyzed consists of the results of NACSW NW1, NW2, NW3, Elite, Summit, L1, L2 & L3 trials from 2009 through 2021.
