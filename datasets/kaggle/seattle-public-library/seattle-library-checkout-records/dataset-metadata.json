The dataset begins with checkouts occurring in April of 2005 through September of 2017. Renewals are not included. \n\nContinuously updated data is [available directly from the library here](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Library-Collection-Inventory/6vkj-f5xf), and [here](https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/Checkouts-by-Title-Physical-Items-/3h5r-qv5w).\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset contains several types of files:\n\n- Checkout records hold the raw data. I've dropped several columns from these files in order to shrink the total dataset size down from a couple of dozen gigabytes; they can be rebuilt by merging with the library collection inventory.\n- The data dictionary allows you to decode the 'ItemType' column from the checkout records.\n- The library collection inventory is a dataset in its own right and stores important metadata about each title, such as the author and subjects.\n\n### Inspiration\n\n- Can you predict which books will be checked out in the coming month? SPL posts fresh data every month, so you can check your forecast by downloading the new data from them. \n- With a bit of imagination, this can be a great dataset for logistics modeling. Make some assumptions about each [location's](http://www.spl.org/locations) storage capacity and where a book was checked out from and you've got a warehouse resource allocation problem. \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset was kindly made available by the [Seattle Public Library][1].
