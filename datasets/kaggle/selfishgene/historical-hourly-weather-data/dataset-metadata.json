  "descriptionNullable": "# Historical Hourly Weather Data\n\nWho amongst us doesn't small talk about the weather every once in a while?  \nThe goal of this dataset is to [elevate this small talk to medium talk][1].  \n\nJust kidding, I actually originally decided to collect this dataset in order to demonstrate basic signal processing concepts, such as filtering, Fourier transform, auto-correlation, cross-correlation, etc..., (for a data analysis course I'm currently preparing).   \nI wanted to demonstrate these concepts on signals that we all have intimate familiarity with and hope that this way these concepts will be better understood than with just made up signals.  \n\nThe weather is excellent for demonstrating these kinds of concepts as it contains periodic temporal structure with two very different periods (daily and yearly).\n\n![a nice 4 seasons image][2]\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset contains ~5 years of **high temporal resolution** (hourly measurements) data of various weather attributes, such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, etc.  \nThis data is available for 30 US and Canadian Cities, as well as 6 Israeli cities.  \nI've organized the data according to a common time axis for easy use.   \nEach attribute has it's own file and is organized such that the rows are the time axis (it's the same time axis for all files), and the columns are the different cities (it's the same city ordering for all files as well).  \nAdditionally, for each city we also have the country, latitude and longitude information in a separate file.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe dataset was aquired using [Weather API][3] on the [OpenWeatherMap website][4], and is available under the [ODbL License][5].  \n\n### Inspiration\n\nWeather data is both intrinsically interesting, and also potentially useful when correlated with other types of data.  \nFor example, [Wildfire][6] spread is potentially related to weather conditions, demand for cabs is famously known to be correlated with weather conditions ([here][7], [here][8] and [here][9] you can find NYC cab ride data), and use of city bikes is probably also correlated with weather in interesting ways (check out [this Austin dataset][10], [this SF dataset][11], [this Montreal dataset][12], and [this NYC dataset][13]).  \n[Traffic][14] is also probably related to weather.   \nAnother potentially interesting source of correlation is between weather and crime. Here are a few crime datasets on kaggle of cities present in this weather dataset: [Chicago][15], [Philadelphia][16], [Los Angeles][17], [Vancouver][18], [Austin][19], [NYC][20]  \n\nThere are many other potentially interesting connections between everyday life and the weather that we can explore together with the help of this dataset.
