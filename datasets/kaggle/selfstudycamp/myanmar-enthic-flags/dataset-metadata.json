  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nThis is an open-source Myanmar dataset, aimed for computer vision enthusiasts and university students who want to research about image classification field associated with one of the Myanmar traits. As there are less Myanmar trait related dataset for computer vision, we would like to kindly contribute Myanmar Ethnic Flags dataset which contains 8 major flags of ethnic races in Myanmar. \n\n### Goal \nThe goal of the dataset is to simply perform multi-label image classification to determine how your model perfectly predict the types of various ethnic flags. Feel free to share your training codes in the code section with public access.\n\n### Dataset Creation \nSince there are insufficient amount of ethnic flags photos on both social media and google image search to train a model, we planned to create our own synthetic dataset. Our team extracted foregrounds of 8 types of ethnic flags and combine with other various types of backgrounds to produce synthetic dataset to make neural networks more intelligent and generalized. \n\n### About Dataset\nEach ethnic flag folder contains 150 images, a total of 1200 images for all flags. The class labels are as described in meta/labels.txt. You will find 3 folders in data explorer section.\n\n1. ds_ no _split\n2. ds_split\n3. meta\n\n**ds_ no _split**\nThis folder contains original dataset which is not split into train, val and test datasets. Each sub folders contains flags related with each ethnic races. \n\n**ds_split**\nThis folder contains the original dataset which is split into train, val, test dataset with the ratio of train - 80%, val - 10%, test - 10%. The eval folder contains same images with test folder but with sub folders for each ethnic race.\n\n**meta**\nThis folder contains the class labels and image paths for ds_split folder.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe background and foreground images are mainly from google image search. Salute to all collaborators who gave huge effort on making this dataset. Each collaborator name is mentioned in [metadata section](https://www.kaggle.com/selfstudycamp/myanmar-enthic-flags/metadata). \n\n\n### Contribution \n\nIf you're willing to add more images, make suggestions or contribute any improvements to our synthetic dataset, do not hesitate to contact us at selfstudycamp.info@gmail.com\n\n",
