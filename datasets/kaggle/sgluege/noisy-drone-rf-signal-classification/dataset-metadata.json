It consists of the non-overlapping signal vectors of length of 16384, which corresponds to approx. 1.2ms at 14MHz. We have also added Labnoise (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Amplifier) and Gaussian noise to the dataset.  \n\nAfter normalization, the drone signals were mixed with either Labnoise (50%) or Gaussian noise (50%). The noise class was created by mixing Labnoise and Gaussian noise in all possible combinations (i.e., Labnoise + Labnoise, Labnoise + Gaussian noise, Gaussian noise + Labnoise, and Gaussian noise + Gaussian noise). For the drone signal classes, as for the noise class, the number of samples for each level of SNR is equally distributed over the interval of SNR in [-20, 30]dB in steps of 2dB, i.e., 3792 - 3800 samples per SNR. The resulting number of samples per class is shown in the Table below.\n\n\n| DJI | FutabaT14 | FutabaT7 | Graupner | Taranis | Turnigy | Noise|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 2194 | 6938 | 3661 | 6481 | 16546 | 10333 | 52552 |\n\n\n#Cite the data:\nIf you find the data useful for your work please cite our related paper https://www.scitepress.org/Link.aspx?doi=10.5220/0012176800003595.\n\nGl\u00fcge, S.; Nyfeler, M.; Ramagnano, N.; Horn, C. and Sch\u00fcpbach, C.
