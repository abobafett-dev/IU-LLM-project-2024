Papilledema, on the other hand, is a swelling of the optic disc due to increased intracranial pressure. It is important to distinguish pseudo papilledema from true papilledema, which can be the first sign of disc disease process with the potential for vision loss, neurological impairment, or death. Patients thought to have papilledema are often subjected to lumbar puncture, MRI, and extensive laboratory studies to find the underlying cause.
