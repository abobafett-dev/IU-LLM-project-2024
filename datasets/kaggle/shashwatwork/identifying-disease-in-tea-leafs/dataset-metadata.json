Each of the classes contains more than 100 images. The dataset was collected in Johnstone Boiyon farm, Koiwa location, Bomet county from a clone of 1510. It can be used with transfer learning for Machine learning models for predicting sickness in tea.\n\n**Dataset is open-sourced from [here.](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/j32xdt2ff5/2)**",
