The Oxford pet breed dataset [1] contained 200 high quality pet images of 12 cat breeds but a larger dataset was desired (note: the Oxford data set also has dog breed images that were not used).  The second source [2] had a very large number of images; however, many were either misclassified or were of very poor quality.  The author's of this collection manually filtered out high quality images from this [2] collection and combined them with the Oxford set.  The Egyptian Mau and Sphynx image sets required additional images from a Google Image search in order to obtain 375 total images.  Even though all of the photos were manually inspected there are probably still some misclassifications, but the overall quality should be significantly better than that of the original dataset of source [2] and of a larger size than of source [1].\n\nSources:\n[1] Cats and Dogs Breeds Classification Oxford Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zippyz/cats-and-dogs-breeds-classification-oxford-dataset\n[2] Cat Breeds Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ma7555/cat-breeds-dataset\n[3] Google Images (for a few extra Egyptian Mau (32) and Sphynx (15) )\n\n     Breeds:\n        Abyssinian\n        American Bobtail\n        American Shorthair\n        Bengal\n        Birman\n        Bombay\n        British Shorthair\n        Egyptian Mau\n        Maine Coon\n        Persian\n        Ragdoll\n        Russian Blue\n        Siamese\n        Sphynx\n        Tuxedo\n\nImage labeling: Images that originated from source [1] start with the cat breed followed by an underscore \"_\".
