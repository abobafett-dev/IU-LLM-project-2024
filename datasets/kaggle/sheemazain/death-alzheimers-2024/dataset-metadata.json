Medical Information:\n   - Date of death\n   - Cause of death (primary, secondary, contributing factors)\n   - Duration of illness\n   - Comorbid conditions (other diseases present)\n\n3. Health Care Information:\n   - Type of care received (home care, nursing home, hospital, hospice)\n   - Frequency of medical visits\n   - Medications prescribed\n\n4. Socioeconomic Factors:\n   - Education level\n   - Income level\n   - Marital status\n   - Living situation (alone, with family, in a facility)\n\n Analyzing the Dataset\n\n1. Data Cleaning:\n   - Remove duplicates\n   - Handle missing values (impute or remove)\n   - Standardize formats (e.g., dates, categorical variables)\n\n2. Descriptive Statistics:\n   - Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)\n   - Create visualizations (histograms, bar charts, pie charts)\n\n3. Trends and Patterns:\n   - Time series analysis (trend over years)\n   - Geographic patterns (mapping deaths across regions)\n   - Demographic patterns (age, gender, ethnicity differences)\n\n4. Statistical Analysis:\n   - Correlation analysis (relationship between variables)\n   - Regression analysis (predictive modeling)\n   - Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards model)\n\n5.
