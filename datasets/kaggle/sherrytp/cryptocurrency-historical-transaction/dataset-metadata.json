[Huobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huobi), one of the cryptocurrency trading websites, is founded in China and then moves to have offices in Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, Singapore (now Singapore-based), and the United States, which works safely and easily to buy & sell, we have Bitcoin, Ethereum & Litecoin for everyone.
