The mouth and the nose of a person are visible.\n\u2022\t\"MaskOnChinMouth\" images: In this, the mask is covering the chin and the mouth area. The nose of a person is not covered.\n\u2022\t\"Simple WithMask\" images:- It consists of data samples of face masks without any texture, logos, etc.\n\u2022\t\"Complex WithMask\" images: It includes the images of the sophisticated face masks with textures, logos, or designs printed on them.\n\u2022\t\"Simple WithoutMask images: These are images without any occlusion.\n\u2022\t\"complex WithoutMask\" images: It consists of faces with occlusion, such as beard, hair, and hands covering the face.\n",
