Since the dataset had similar features and format as the synthetic data in the [Playground Series Season 3 Episode 5](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e5) competition, I figured that this may help and be of relevance in model training. Feel free to experiment with this data and see if it improves the score.\n\n# Data Set Information:\n\nThe two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine. For more details, consult: [Web Link] or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).\n\nThese datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.\n\n# About Features\n\n**Input variables**\n\n1. Fixed acidity\n  - predominant fixed acids found in wines are tartaric, malic, citric, and succinic.\n  - Most of these acids originate in grapes with the exception of succinic acid, which is produced by yeast during the fermentation process\n \n\n2. Volatile acidity\n  - measure of the low molecular weight (or steam distillable) fatty acids in wine\n  - generally perceived as the odour of vinegar.\n  - average volatile acidity value for red table wines during this period is about **0.60 g/L**. The average volatile acidity value for white table wines is about **0.43 g/L**\n \n \n3. Citric acid\n  - a weak organic\nacid, which is often used as a natural preservative or additive to food or\ndrink to add a sour taste to food \n  - can be added to finished wines to increase acidity and give a \u201cfresh\" flavor. \n  - may increase the growth of unwanted microbes since bacteria feed on critic acid for metabolism\n \n \n4. Residual sugar\n  - from natural grape sugars leftover in a wine after the alcoholic fermentation finishes\n  - many grocery store wines labeled as \u201cdry\" contain about **10 g/L** of residual sugar, while sweet wines start at around **35 g/L**\n \n \n5. Chlorides\n  - give the wine a salty flavor, which may turn away some customers\n  - Maximum concentration of chlorides in wine is about **0.20 - 0.60 g/L**\n \n \n6. Free sulfur dioxide\n  - an essential winemaking additive that has the dual properties of anti-oxidation and preservation. \n  - concentrations of free SO2 values of **25 mg/L** on red wine and **30 mg /L** on white wine are recommended.\n\n\n7. Total sulfur dioxide\n  - combination of 2 types of sulfur dioxide (SO2): **free SO2 + active SO2**\n  - An active SO2 concentration of **0.35 mg/L** ensures a minimum protection, and a value of **0.6 mg/L** maximum protection\n \n \n8. Density\n  -  mass per unit volume of wine \n  - After fermentation, the specific gravity the wine should be at, or slightly **less than 1.00**\n \n \n9. pH\n  - a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution\n(lower pH indicates higher acidity).\n  - The pH level of a wine ranges from **3 to 4**\n \n10. Sulphates\n  -  a food preservative widely used in winemaking, thanks to their ability to maintain the flavor\n  - particularly associated with a long list of side effects related to wine consumption, including the dreaded wine-induced headache\n \n11. Alcohol\n  - an organic compound that carries at least one hydroxyl\nfunctional group (\u2212OH) bound to a saturated carbon atom.\n  - Wine can have anywhere between 5% and 23% Alcohol by Volume (ABV)\n\n**Output variable**\n\n12. Quality\n  - score between 0 and 10\n  - based on sensory data, tasted and rated by wine experts\n\n# Source:\n\n&gt; Paulo Cortez, University of Minho, Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal, http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez\nA.
