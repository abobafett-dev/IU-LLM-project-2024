The data consists of both textual information and meta-information about the jobs. The dataset can be used to create classification models which can learn the job descriptions which are fraudulent. \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe University of the Aegean | Laboratory of Information & Communication Systems Security\nhttp://emscad.samos.aegean.gr/\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThe dataset is very valuable as it can be used to answer the following questions:\n\n1. Create a classification model that uses text data features and meta-features and predict which job description are fraudulent or real.  \n2. Identify key traits/features (words, entities, phrases) of job descriptions which are fraudulent in nature. \n3. Run a contextual embedding model to identify the most similar job descriptions.\n4. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to identify interesting insights from this dataset. ",
