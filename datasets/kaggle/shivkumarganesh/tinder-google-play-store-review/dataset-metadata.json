Users \"swipe right\" to like or \"swipe left\" to dislike other users' profiles, which include their photo, a short bio, and a list of their interests. Tinder uses a \"double opt-in\" system where both users must match before they can exchange messages.\n\nSean Rad founded Tinder in 2012 at a hackathon held at the startup incubator Hatch Labs in West Hollywood. By 2014, Tinder was registering about one billion daily \"swipes\" and reported that users logged into the app on average 11 times a day. In 2015, Tinder was the fifth highest-grossing mobile app, and in 2019 it surpassed Netflix in annual spending. In 2020, Tinder had 6.2 million subscribers and 75 million monthly active users.
