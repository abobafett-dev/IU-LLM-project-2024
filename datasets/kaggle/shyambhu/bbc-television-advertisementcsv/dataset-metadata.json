The column 'target' has values -1  and 1 respectively denoting non-commercial and commercial program. \nIn feature File, there are numbered columns. Below here is the description for different columns as provided by the source.\nShot Length\n1\nMotion Distribution( Mean and Variance)\n2 - 3\nFrame Difference Distribution ( Mean and Variance)\n4 - 5\nShort time energy ( Mean and Variance)\n6 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 7 \nZCR( Mean and Variance)\n8 - 9\nSpectral Centroid ( Mean and Variance)\n10 - 11\nSpectral Roll off ( Mean and Variance)\n12 - 13\nSpectral Flux ( Mean and Variance)\n14 - 15\nFundamental Frequency ( Mean and Variance)\n16 - 17\nMotion Distribution ( 40 bins)\n18 -  58\nFrame Difference Distribution ( 32 bins)\n59 - 91\nText area distribution (  15 bins Mean  and 15 bins for variance )\n92 - 122\nBag of Audio Words ( 4000 bins)\n123 -  4123\nEdge change Ratio ( Mean and Variance)\n4124 - 4125\n\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis is not my dataset.
