Since I gathered the data and have been having trouble developing the model, I decided to share my dataset. The data was gathered from [wikiart.org](https://www.wikiart.org/), where I scraped all the artworks from certain artists belonging to these movements.  Upvote if you find this dataset useful!\n\nA few things to keep in mind while using this dataset are:\nIf there wasn\u2019t much art for a movement, I broadened the movements to encompass more artworks. An example of this is that there were not enough Byzantine artworks so I clumped these with all western medieval artworks. \nArt movements evolve from each other so movements can be very closely related\nI am not an art expert so some artworks may be mislabeled or can be categorized as more than one movement so I encourage comments\n\n\nData Descriptions:\n\nFor more detailed descriptions feel free to visit the art movements/styles from [wikiart.org](https://www.wikiart.org/)\n\nAcademic Art: Academic art, or Academicism, is a style of painting and sculpture produced under the influence of European academies of art. Specifically, academic art is the art and artists influenced by the standards of the French Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts, which practiced under the movements of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, and the art that followed these two movements in the attempt to synthesize both of their styles.\n\nArt Nouveau: Art Nouveau is an international style of art, architecture, and applied art, especially the decorative arts, that was most popular between 1890 and 1910. A reaction to the academic art of the 19th century, it was inspired by natural forms and structures, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers. \n\nBaroque:  The origin of the term Baroque is a bit ambiguous. Many scholars think it was derived from the Portuguese barrocco, meaning an imperfect or irregularly shaped pearl. And some, like the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau thought it was derived from the Italian barocco, a term used to describe an obstacle in formal logic in the medieval period.\n\n\nRealism: Realism in the arts is the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions, implausible, exotic, and supernatural elements. Realism has been prevalent in the arts for many periods and is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization.\n\nRenaissance (Western):  The Renaissance is a period in European history marking the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity and covering the 15th and 16th centuries, characterized by an effort to revive and surpass ideas and achievements of classical antiquity.\n\nRomanticism: Romanticism (also the Romantic era or the Romantic period) was an artistic, literary, musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850. Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature, preferring the medieval rather than the classical.\n\nExpressionism: Expressionism was a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas. Expressionist artists sought to express the meaning of emotional experience rather than physical reality. \n\nJapanese Art: Art from Japan from the Muromachi period (1392-1573) all the way to the Sh\u014dwa period (1926-1989)\n\nNeoclassicism: Europeans of the 18th century Age of Enlightenment wanted their artwork and architecture to mirror and carry the same standards as the idealized works of the Greeks and Romans. In conjunction with the exciting archaeological rediscoveries of Pompeii and Herculaneum in Rome, Neoclassicism arose as artists and architects infused their work with past Greco-Roman ideals. A return to the study of science, history, mathematics, and anatomical correctness abounded, replacing the Rococo vanity culture and court-painting climate that preceded.\n\nPrimitivism (Na\u00efve Art): Primitivism is a Western art movement that borrows visual forms from non-Western or prehistoric peoples, such as Paul Gauguin's inclusion of Tahitian motifs in paintings and ceramics. Borrowings from primitive art have been important to the development of modern art. \n\nRococo: Rococo infused the world of art and interior design with an aristocratic idealism that favored elaborate ornamentation and intricate detailing. The paintings that became the signature to the era were created in celebration of Rococo's grandiose ideals and lust for the aristocratic lifestyle and pastimes. The movement, which developed in France in the early 1700s, evolved into a new, over-the-top marriage of the decorative and fine arts, which became a visual lexicon that infiltrated 18th-century continental Europe.\n\nSymbolism: Symbolism was a late nineteenth-century art movement of French, Russian and Belgian origin in poetry and other arts. Distinct from, but related to, the style of literature, symbolism in art is related to the gothic component of Romanticism and Impressionism. \n\nWestern Medieval: Artworks belonging to Byzantine, Pre-Romanesque, Gothic, Medieval, and Coptic movements\n\n\nAcknowledgments:\n\nShoutout to Lucas David for the [Wikiart Retriever](https://github.com/lucasdavid/wikiart) which I used to scrape all the image data\n\n",
