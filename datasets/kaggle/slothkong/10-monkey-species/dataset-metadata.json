Each folder contains 10 subforders labeled as n0~n9, each corresponding a species form [Wikipedia's monkey cladogram][1]. Images are 400x300 px or larger and JPEG format (almost 1400 images).  Images were downloaded with help of the [googliser][2] open source code.\n\n    Label mapping:\n    n0, alouatta_palliata\n    n1, erythrocebus_patas\n    n2, cacajao_calvus \n    n3, macaca_fuscata   \n    n4, cebuella_pygmea\n    n5, cebus_capucinus\n    n6, mico_argentatus\n    n7, saimiri_sciureus \n    n8, aotus_nigriceps\n    n9, trachypithecus_johnii\n\n\n - For more information on the monkey species and number of images per class make sure to check `monkey_labels.txt` file. \n\n\n### Aim\n\nThis dataset is intended as a test case for fine-grain classification tasks, perhaps best  used in combination with transfer learning. Hopefully someone can help us expand the number of classes or number of images. \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to Romain Renard for his help with the code implementation. Also, thanks to Gustavo Montoya, Jacky Zhang and Sofia Loaiciga  for their help with the dataset curation.\n\n### Notes\nSome demo code for usage of the dataset in combination with Keras can be found in this [repo][3].\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey\n  [2]: https://github.com/teracow/googliser\n  [3]: https://github.com/slothkong/CNN_classification_10_monkey_species\n",
