Its available at: \n<br>\nSee also the other project files like the Database, server application and smartwatch app files and - the machine learning files. All the stuff is delivered with some tutorials which will help you to understand the hole project and challenge the box punch classification using the smartwatch app and the machine learning algorithms. <br>\n__Happy Coding :-)__",
