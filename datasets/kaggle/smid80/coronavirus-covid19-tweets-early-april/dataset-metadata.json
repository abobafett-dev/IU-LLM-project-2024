To ensure that all files are visible to users and no files are too large, it seems prudent to create a second dataset to split the files into manageable groups of approximately half a month. **The first file also contains a file that matches `country` with `country_code` and may be useful for users.**\n\nThe first dataset (for the country file and for Tweets in March) is located here: [https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/coronavirus-covid19-tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/coronavirus-covid19-tweets) \nThe third dataset (for Tweets in late April) is located here: [https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/coronavirus-covid19-tweets-late-april](https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/coronavirus-covid19-tweets-late-april)\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset contains variables associated with Twitter: the text of various tweets and the accounts that tweeted them, the hashtags used and the locations of the accounts. \n\nNote that due to the large volume of Tweets, there may be some gaps for some hashtags (not all Tweets with a given hashtag may be captured). Because some hashtags are used less frequently than other hashtags, less frequently used hashtags may span a longer period of time (going back earlier) than more frequently used hashtags. \n\nThe retweets argument has been set to FALSE, so this dataset does not include retweets (although a count of retweets is provided as a variable). \n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset would not be possible without the creators of the rtweet package on CRAN. The cover and thumbnail images are from the CDC, and downloaded from unsplash. \n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nDo countries with more cases also have more Tweets? ",
