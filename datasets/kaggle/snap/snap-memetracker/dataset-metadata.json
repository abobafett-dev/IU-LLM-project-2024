This makes it possible to see how different stories compete for news and blog coverage each day, and how certain stories persist while others fade quickly.\n\nOverall Memetracker tracks more than 17 million different phrases and about 54% of the total phrase/quote mentions appear on blogs and 46% in news media.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis dataset was collected by the Stanford Network Analysis Project.
