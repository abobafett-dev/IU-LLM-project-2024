  "descriptionNullable": "## Description\n**CityTrek-14K** is a distinctive, extensive dataset that includes **14,000 trajectories from 280 drivers**, each contributing 50 trajectories, in three major U.S. cities: **Philadelphia (PA), Atlanta (GA), and Memphis (TN)**. It features a time series data set capturing details like timestamps, vehicle speeds, and GPS coordinates, with a collection frequency of 1Hz. Although the dataset includes location data, strict anonymization practices were adhered to, ensuring personal information like home or work addresses remain confidential. The CityTrek-14K dataset offers a comprehensive view of driving patterns, encompassing over **4,800 hours** of driving data and spanning more than **189,000 miles**, collected between **July 2017 and March 2019**. The dataset comprises two distinct files: the first is a summary of the trips, and the second is a trajectory data file that includes detailed records captured every second.\n\n## Acknowledgements\nIf you use this dataset, please kindly cite the following paper:\n- [Moosavi, Sobhan, and Rajiv Ramnath. \"Context-aware driver risk prediction with telematics data.\" Accident Analysis & Prevention 192 (2023): 107269.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001457523003160)\n\n## Data Collection Methodology\nThe CityTrek-14K dataset was collected using specially designed devices installed in vehicles. These devices were configured to record and transmit data frequently. Further details about this data collection process are elaborated in the paper mentioned above. \n\n## Potential Applications\nThe CityTrek-14K dataset is versatile, suitable for numerous applications such as:\n- Traffic Modeling and ETA Prediction: The dataset contains detailed route information and travel times, making it an excellent resource for large-scale traffic modeling and ETA modeling techniques. \n- Route Optimization: With its detailed trajectory data, the dataset is ideal for developing and testing route optimization techniques, providing insights into efficient pathfinding methods.\n- Modeling and Analyzing Driver Behavior: As each driver in the dataset has exactly 50 trajectories recorded, this allows for a comprehensive analysis of driver behavior, offering a unique opportunity to study and model driving patterns and habits.\n\n## Usage Policy and Legal Disclaimer\nThis dataset is being distributed solely for research purposes under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
