  "descriptionNullable": "### Description\nThis is a countrywide traffic congestion dataset that covers __49 states of the USA__. The congestion events data were collected from __February 2016 to September 2022__, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by various entities, including the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks. The dataset contains approximately __33 million congestion records__. We also provide a __sampled version__ of data that includes 2 million events for easier processing and handling for those who prefer to work with a smaller amount of data.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nIf you use this dataset, please kindly cite the following paper:\n\n- Moosavi, Sobhan, Mohammad Hossein Samavatian, Arnab Nandi, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, and Rajiv Ramnath.
