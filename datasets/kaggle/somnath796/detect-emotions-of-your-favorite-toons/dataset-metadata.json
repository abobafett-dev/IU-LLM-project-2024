On this International Day of Happiness, we are bringing back all the joy and happiness for you. This fun challenge requires you to build a model that detects emotions of your favorite characters of the iconic toon show\u2014Tom and Jerry.\n\n##**Task**\nYou are required to extract frames from a video clip that is provided in the dataset and classify the primary character\u2019s emotion into one of the following five classes:\n\n- Angry\n- Happy\n- Sad\n- Surprised\n- Unknown\n\n##NOTE\n\nThe character prioritization is Tom &gt; Jerry &gt; Others.\nIn case a frame does not contain Tom or Jerry\u2019s faces for emotion detection, it is classified as \u2018Unknown\u2019,\nData\n\n###**Data**\nData files \n\nThe dataset contains two video files and two .csv files. These files perform the following tasks:\n\n- *Train Tom and jerry.mp4*: Video file used for training\n- *Train.csv*: Contains human-generated labels for 298 frames *[Framerate=5]* from the training video\n- *Test Tom and jerry.mp4*: Video file to detect emotions on the face\n- *Results.csv*: Contains 186 frames *[Framerate=5]* from the test video in .csv format\n\n",
