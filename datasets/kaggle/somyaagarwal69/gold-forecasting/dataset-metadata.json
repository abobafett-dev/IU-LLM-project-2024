  "descriptionNullable": "This model will help us in knowing that how Crude oil price, interest rate (repo rate), Indian currency price in dollars, Sensex (BSE), Inflation rate and US Dollar index will follow a relationship with the gold price directly or indirectly. \n\nThe regression analysis in which we use one dependent variable and multiple independent variables is called a multivariate regression analysis. The forecasting plays an important role in econometrics and also helps to determine government policies with optimality. The business decision which are dependent on the prices of such commodities can make benefits from a feasible prediction. We will have a brief view over the error mean square values of the regression model which will guide us about the predictive ability of the predictive model . The data is wide spread across the time and is available from dated 1st October 2000 to 1 August 2020.\n\nA prediction model is developed for the gold price in India dependent on 5 variables using the statistical interpretations from these variables. The independent variables taken were crude oil prices, USD to INR, Sensex, CPI and Interest rate. The model passes different aspects such as adjusted R squared, T test and Durbin Watson with high favoring values.\n\n The model is passed as a perfect fit along with the residual analysis which depicts that the model is a good fit and acceptable. The data was taken for a long span of time period and there were no missing values which was favorable for the regression model. We could observe a strong relation between the gold price and USD to INR, CPI and Sensex values. In future, more variables can be a part of this model and the data can be for a longer time span leading to the other heights of optimality.\n\nForecast for the gold prices is created for the next 10 months ahead using ARIMA Model.",
