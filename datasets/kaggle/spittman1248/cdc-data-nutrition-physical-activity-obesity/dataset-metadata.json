This data is used for DNPAO's Data, Trends, and Maps database, which provides national and state specific data on obesity, nutrition, physical activity, and breastfeeding.  I was particularly curious on whether socioeconomic status has an impact on obesity.  In my analysis, I compare the obesity rate in each state, and then perform a linear regression on the obesity rate for each educational status and the income bracket.  \n",
