Our collection features facial expressions categorized into training and testing sets from five distinct regions:\n\n* Region 0 (American)\n* Region 1 (African)\n* Region 2 (Asian)\n* Region 3 (Indian)\n* Region 4 (European)\n\nThis structure provides a robust foundation for developing and validating region detection models that are sensitive to cultural nuances in facial expressions. Dive into this unique collection to enhance your machine learning projects with a global perspective on region recognition.",
