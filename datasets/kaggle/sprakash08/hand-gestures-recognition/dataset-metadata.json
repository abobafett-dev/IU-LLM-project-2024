With these aspects in the mind, I have come up with a custom hand gestures dataset. The challenge of this dataset is that it there is a lot of noise and image size is small. \n\n### Content\nI have created data with train and test. The training set contains images of some of the selected hand gestures and background. The test set contains the test images. The goal is to perform real-time recognition of these gestures in realtime to perform some actions. Here, are some of the images:\n![Four Gesture](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F1395159%2F953c9300e27c94164fea7f3c07415957%2Ffour_gesture143.png?generation=1577053163094582&alt=media)\n![L gesture](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F1395159%2Fd1b2e48904648942f3d92bf89eb86e75%2Fl_gesture463.png?generation=1577053202202497&alt=media)\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F1395159%2F86f4e0dbcfc50948e8d3bb7fb6de1893%2Fthumb_gesture62.png?generation=1577053509488099&alt=media)\n\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\nI would like to acknowledge open source technologies that helped in created such a dataset.\n\n\n### Inspiration\nThe inspiration for this dataset was to control the functions of the keyboard to reduce volume, play music, shutdown computer and lock the computer.
