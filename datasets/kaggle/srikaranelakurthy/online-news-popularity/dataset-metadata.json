  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nAs digital media is growing the competition between online platforms also has rapidly increased. Online platforms like Buzzfeed, Mashable, Medium, towards data science publish hundreds of articles of every day. In this report, we analyze the Mashable dataset which consists of articles data information mainly as a number of unique words, number of non-stop words, the postpositive polarity of words, negative polarity of words, etc. Here we intend to predict the number of shares that articles can be shared. This will be very helpful for Mashable to decide which articles should they publish because they can actually predict which articles will be having the maximum number of shares. Random forest regression has been used to predict the number of shares and it can achieve an accuracy of 70% with Parameter tuning. As there is the number of articles that will be collected from different ways but to classify or group these articles into separate categories for an online platform it will be a difficult job. To handle this problem, in this report we have used neural-networks to classify the articles into different categories. By doing so, the people doesn't need to do an extensive search because the Mashable can keep an interface with articles classified into different categories which in-turn will help people to choose the category and directly search their articles. \n\n### Content\n\nWith the growth of the Internet in daily life, people are in a minute away to read the news or watch any entertainment or read articles of different categories. As the growth of the internet, even the usage by the people of it has increased rapidly, it actually became their part of life. Nowadays as people using the internet more, they are studying the articles for their knowledge or news or of any sector online. As the demand is increased even online platforms rivalry has increased. Due to this, every online platform is striving to publish the articles on their site which have great value and bring most shares. In this project, we do the prediction of shares of an article based on the data produced by \u2018Mashable\u2019 where they collected data of around 39000 articles. For this prediction, we have used Random forest Regression. In this report will be discussing why the Random forest  Regression has been choosing for the prediction of shares by analyzing the Data set and doing cross-tabulation, what is the variance of the dataset and how many levels of bias it is with-holding. Even discuss about the features selection and why decided to do some feature engineering and how it will be helpful in increasing the accuracy.  Even in this report, we discuss how these predictions will be helpful for Mashable organization on their decision of publishing the articles.\n\t\nIn this paper, we will see to handle the issue of classifying articles such as entertainment, news, lifestyle, technology, etc. To obtain this classification used the neural networks. In this paper, we will discuss why did we choose the neural networks for classification and what type of feature engineering has been used. At what levels of hidden layers and neurons the model is being affected at what stages model got started getting overfitted. For classification after the output layer, we used soft-max function. In this paper, an 11 layer neural network classifier has been used and achieved around 80% of accuracy. Methods used to achieve this accuracy are constant check rate of accuracy with different layers and neurons, standardization technique and feature selection using a correlation matrix.\n\nRelated work on the study and analysis of Online News Popularity is done by the Shuo Zhang from Australian National University where they predicted the article will be popular or not and used binary neural network classification. The other related works also achieved greater accuracy of 70% but here they actually predicted the shares by applying different regression techniques. This paper was worked by He Ren and Quan Yang work in DepaDepartment of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nBringing value from a heavy data set.
