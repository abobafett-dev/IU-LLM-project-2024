A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. This algorithm \"only looks once\" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.\n\n### Content\nThe dataset contains media of cars in all views, and your job is to create an algorithm to detect them!\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI got this dataset from TJHSST from one of the competitions they hosted.\n\n",
