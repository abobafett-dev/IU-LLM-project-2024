There is at least one other version of this dataset on Kaggle that was uploaded without permission. Please be fair and attribute the original author.\nThis synthetic dataset is modeled after an existing milling machine and consists of 10 000 data points from a stored as rows with 14 features in columns\n\n1.\tUID: unique identifier ranging from 1 to 10000\n2.\tproduct ID: consisting of a letter L, M, or H for low (50% of all products), medium (30%) and high (20%) as product quality variants and a variant-specific serial number\n3.\ttype: just the product type L, M or H from column 2\n4.\tair temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process later normalized to a standard deviation of 2 K around 300 K\n5.\tprocess temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process normalized to a standard deviation of 1 K, added to the air temperature plus 10 K.\n6.\trotational speed [rpm]: calculated from a power of 2860 W, overlaid with a normally distributed noise\n7.\ttorque [Nm]: torque values are normally distributed around 40 Nm with a SD = 10 Nm and no negative values.\n8.\ttool wear [min]: The quality variants H/M/L add 5/3/2 minutes of tool wear to the used tool in the process. \n9.\ta 'machine failure' label that indicates, whether the machine has failed in this particular datapoint for any of the following failure modes are true.\n\nThe machine failure consists of five independent failure modes\n10.\ttool wear failure (TWF): the tool will be replaced of fail at a randomly selected tool wear time between 200 - 240 mins (120 times in our dataset). At this point in time, the tool is replaced 69 times, and fails 51 times (randomly assigned).\n11.\theat dissipation failure (HDF): heat dissipation causes a process failure, if the difference between air- and process temperature is below 8.6 K and the tools rotational speed is below 1380 rpm. This is the case for 115 data points.\n12.\tpower failure (PWF): the product of torque and rotational speed (in rad/s) equals the power required for the process. If this power is below 3500 W or above 9000 W, the process fails, which is the case 95 times in our dataset.\n13.\toverstrain failure (OSF): if the product of tool wear and torque exceeds 11,000 minNm for the L product variant (12,000 M, 13,000 H), the process fails due to overstrain. This is true for 98 datapoints.\n14.\trandom failures (RNF): each process has a chance of 0,1 % to fail regardless of its process parameters. This is the case for only 5 datapoints, less than could be expected for 10,000 datapoints in our dataset.\nIf at least one of the above failure modes is true, the process fails and the 'machine failure' label is set to 1. It is therefore not transparent to the machine learning method, which of the failure modes has caused the process to fail.\n\nThis dataset is part of the following publication, please cite when using this dataset:\nS.
