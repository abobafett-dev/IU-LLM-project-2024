Weights represent number of events attended in each group.\n- `group-edges.csv`: Edge list for constructing a group-to-group graph. Weights represent shared members between groups.\n- `member-edges.csv`: Edge list for constructing a member-to-member graph. Weights represent shared group membership.\n- `rsvps.csv`: Raw member-to-event attendance data, which was aggregated to form `member-to-group-edges.csv`.\n\n#### Metadata\n- `meta-groups.csv`: Information for each group, including name and category. `group_id` can serve as index.\n- `meta-members.csv`: Information for each member, including name and location. `member_id` can serve as index.\n- `meta-events.csv`: Information for each event, including name and time. `event_id` can serve as index.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nI'd like to acknowledge the folks at MeetUp.com, who have made their database publicly available via a convenient REST API. Even newbies like myself can access and enjoy!\n\n\n  [1]: http://stkbailey.github.io",
