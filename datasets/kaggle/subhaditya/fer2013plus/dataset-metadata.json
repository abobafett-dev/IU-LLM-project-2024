Fer2013Plus was an effort by Microsoft to correct that. \n\n### What's the difference from FER2013?\nThe labels have been replaced with the maximum prediction of 15 other people who gave their version of them. Hence it has much more accurate labels.\n\n### Acknowledgement\nI do not own the data and have not conducted either experiment. I just find FER to be a very overused dataset and having better labels is nice. Microsoft provided a utility to make this happen with crowdsourced labels but it is a little hard to get to work and many people might just give up. So I rewrote the porting code and did the processing myself in the hopes it would help others.\n\n### A note\nIf anyone who owns this data has an issue with it, feel free to let me know and I will take it down.\n\n### Disclaimer\nI am in no way affiliated with Microsoft or the team that made FER or the new labels.
