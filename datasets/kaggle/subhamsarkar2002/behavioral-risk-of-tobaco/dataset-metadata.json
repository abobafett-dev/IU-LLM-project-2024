  "descriptionNullable": "Over the past decade, from 2011 to 2023, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has meticulously tracked and evaluated tobacco-related activities through its State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System. This system relies on data collected from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a comprehensive state-based surveillance initiative aimed at gathering information on modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases and other leading causes of death. Specifically, the STATE System focuses on various tobacco-related topics, including prevalence rates of cigarette and e-cigarette use across different demographics, frequency of use, and attempts to quit smoking. It's important to note that the data collected from 2010 and earlier should not be compared directly with the more recent findings due to changes in methodologies.",
