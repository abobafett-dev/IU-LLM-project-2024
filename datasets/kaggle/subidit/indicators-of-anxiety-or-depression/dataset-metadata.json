  "descriptionNullable": "# Indicators of Anxiety or Depression Based on Reported Frequency of Symptoms During Last 7 Days\n\n`Metadata Updated: October 27, 2022`\n\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) included questions to obtain information on the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms.  The questions are a modified version of the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the two-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) scale on the Household Pulse Survey, collecting information on symptoms over the last 7 days (rather than the typical 14 days). Beginning in Phase 3.2 (July 21, 2021) of data collection and reporting, the question reference period changed from the \u2018last 7 days\u2019 to the \u2018last two weeks\u2019, as typical for this scale.\n\n## Survey Questions\n### Adapted PHQ-2 questions:\n\n* Over the last 7 days, how often have you been bothered by \u2026 having little interest or pleasure in doing things? Would you say not at all, several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day? Select only one answer\n* Over the last 7 days, how often have you been bothered by \u2026 feeling down, depressed, or hopeless? Would you say not at all, several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day? Select only one answer.\n\n### Adapted GAD-2 questions:\n\n* Over the last 7 days, how often have you been bothered by the following problems \u2026 Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge? Would you say not at all, several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day? Select only one answer.\n* Over the last 7 days, how often have you been bothered by the following problems \u2026 Not being able to stop or control worrying? Would you say not at all, several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day? Select only one answer.\n\n## Scoring and Estimation\nFor each scale, the answers are assigned a numerical value: not at all = 0, several days = 1, more than half the days = 2, and nearly every day = 3. The two responses for each scale are added together. A sum equal to three or greater on the PHQ-2 has been shown to be associated with diagnoses of major depressive disorder.  A sum equal to three or greater on the GAD-2 has been shown to be associated with diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder. For adults with scores of 3 or greater, further evaluation by a clinician or other health professional is generally recommended.\n\nEstimates on this page are based on these composite scores. Answers to both questions in the scale were required to calculate the scores. Adults with missing responses to one or both questions are not shown separately in the tables and are not included in the calculation of percentages.",
