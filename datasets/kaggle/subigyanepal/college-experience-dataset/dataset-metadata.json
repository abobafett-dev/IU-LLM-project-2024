  "descriptionNullable": "The **College Experience Study** represents the **most extensive longitudinal mobile sensing study** to date, leveraging passive and automatic sensing data from the smartphones of over 200 Dartmouth students across five years (2017 - 2022). This groundbreaking research aimed to assess their mental health (e.g., depression, stress), the impact of COVID-19, and general behavioral trends.\n\nThe study's importance has been magnified during the global pandemic, necessitating a better understanding of mental health dynamics among undergraduate students throughout their college years. By tracking two cohorts of first-year students both on and off campus, we have accumulated a rich dataset offering insights into changing behaviors, resilience, and mental health in college life. We hope that this dataset will serve as a cornerstone for researchers, educators, and policymakers alike, seeking to enhance their understanding and interventions related to student mental health and behavior. \n\nThis dataset is unique for several reasons. It encompasses deep phone sensing data and self-reports spanning four continuous years for 200 undergraduate students at Dartmouth College, both during term time and breaks. Additionally, it incorporates periodic brain-imaging data for this cohort of students, along with surveys. The College Experience dataset enables researchers to explore numerous issues in behavioral sensing and brain imaging to advance our understanding of college students' mental health.\n\n## Content\n\nCollege Experience Study makes use of the **[StudentLife](https://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/)** app, developed for Android and iOS, autonomously capturing a variety of human behaviors 24/7, including:\n\n- Bed time, wake up time, and sleep duration\n- The number of conversations and the duration of each conversation per day (**Android only**)\n- Physical activity (walking, sitting, running, standing)\n- Locations visited and duration of stay (e.g., dorm, class, party, gym)\n- Stress levels over weeks and throughout college\n- App usage (**Android only**)\n- COVID concern\n- and more\n\nIn addition to passive sensing data, our study also involved gathering responses from detailed surveys and conducting brain scans throughout the research period. These diverse data sources can be used together to uncover insightful correlations and draw meaningful conclusions. An illustrative example of this potential is explored in the study [\"Predicting Brain Functional Connectivity Using Mobile Sensing\"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3381001), which demonstrates how mobile sensing data can predict brain functional connectivity, offering new avenues for understanding mental health conditions.\n\n## Data Availability\n\n| Feature Collected                           | Available in Folder          |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Aggregated Sensing                          | `Sensing`                    |\n| Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA)      | `EMA`                        |\n| Demographics (gender & race)                                                   | `Demographics`  |\n| Surveys & Brain Scans                       | [National Data Archive](https://nda.nih.gov/edit_collection.html?id=2494) (`mapping` will be released soon) |\n| Raw sensing data                            | *To be released later*       |\n\n<br>\n\n\n**Note:** Some features are exclusive to Android phones.
