In the dataset there are total**  7** class\n\n1. Bacterial diseases - Aeromoniasis .There are total 250 image .\n2. Bacterial gill disease . total number of image 250\n3. Bacterial Red disease . total number of image 250\n4. Fungal diseases . Saprolegniasis total number of image 250\n5. Healthy Fish . total number of image 250\n6.
