They can enter the skin through a hair follicle or after a wound.\nAnthrax is one type of bacterium that can enter from the environment. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are bacteria that are commonly present on the skin and only cause a problem in certain circumstances. Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection that causes skin symptoms.\nBacterial infections can be systemic or local. Systemic infections can cause symptoms throughout the whole body, such as a fever, while local infections only affect a specific area. Some bacterial infections can begin in one area and spread throughout the body.\nSome bacterial skin infections, such as impetigo, can spread between people through direct skin contact or with bodily fluids, contaminated food or water, or by touching surfaces where bacteria are present. Others, such as cellulitis, are not contagious.\nDifferent types of bacterial skin infections include:\n\n\u2022\tcellulitis\n\u2022\timpetigo\n\u2022\tHansen\u2019s disease (leprosy)\n\u2022\tsyphilis\n\nSome bacterial infections are mild and easy to treat with topical antibiotics . \n\n\n**Fungal Infections:** These types of skin infections are caused by a fungus and are most likely to develop in moist areas of the body where surfaces meet, such as the feet, armpit, or where there are skin folds.\nIn some cases, an allergy to the fungus causes symptoms in other areas that are not directly affected. For instance, a person with a fungal infection on the foot might develop a rash on their fingers. It doesn\u2019t happen because the person touched their foot.\nDifferent types of fungal infections:\n\n\u2022\tathlete\u2019s foot\n\u2022\tringworm\n\u2022\tnail fungus\n\n**Parasitic Infections: **These types of skin infections are caused by a parasite.
