Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, it\u2019s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people - [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/index.html)\n\nThis dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus. Please note that this is a time series data and so the number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number. \n\nThe data is available from 22 Jan, 2020.\n\n### Column Description\n\nMain file in this dataset is `covid_19_data.csv` and the detailed descriptions are below.\n\n`covid_19_data.csv`\n\n* Sno - Serial number\n* ObservationDate - Date of the observation in MM/DD/YYYY\n* Province/State - Province or state of the observation (Could be empty when missing)\n* Country/Region - Country of observation\n* Last Update - Time in UTC at which the row is updated for the given province or country.
