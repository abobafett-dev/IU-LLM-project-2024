Here is an attempt to provide additional data for real human faces gathered from the internet and annotated manually.\n\n### Content\n\nThere are 5,500 + images with 8 emotions categories \u2013 anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness and surprise. All images contain grayscale human face (or sketch). Each image is 224 x 224 pixel grayscale in PNG format.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nImages are sourced from the internet where they are freely available for download e.g. Google, Unsplash, Flickr etc. \n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nWith a humble purpose to make more annotated data available for use by machine learning based Facial Expression Recognition. There would be a definite scope for improvement in the manual annotation. ",
