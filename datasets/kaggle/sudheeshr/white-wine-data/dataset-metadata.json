For each, we have the wine quality (scored between 0 and 10) and eleven chemical attributes (quantitative), which are as follows: Fixed acidity, Volatile acidity, Citric acid, Residual sugar, Chlorides, Free sulfur dioxide, Total sulfur dioxide, Density, PH, Sulphates, and Alcohol\n\nFixed acidity - Most acids involved wine or fixed or nonvolatile\nVolatile acidity - The number of acetic acids in wine which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste\nCitric acid - Can be found in small quantities, add freshness and the flavor to the wine\nResidual sugar - The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1g/L and wines with greater than 45g/L considered as sweet.\nChlorides - The amount of salt in the wine\nFree sulfur dioxide - The free form of sulfur dioxide that is not bound to other molecules, and is used to calculate molecular sulfur dioxide\nTotal sulfur dioxide - The amount of free and bound forms of sulfur dioxide\nDensity - The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent of alcohol and the sugar\nPH - Describe how acidic or basic a wine in on a scale from 0 to 14\nSulfates - A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas levels, which act as an antimicrobial and antioxidant\nAlcohol - The percent alcohol content of the wine",
