Each image in the dataset is storedwith the corresponding disease type,  providing valuable information for researchers and practitioners in plant pathology and agriculture.\n\n##Dataset Composition\n\nThe dataset contains high-resolution images captured under different lighting conditions and perspectives, showcasing symptoms of plant diseases across multiple plant species.\n\n##Key Features\n\n######Disease Diversity\nCovers a wide range of plant species and diseases, including common pathogens affecting crops, ornamental plants, and trees.\n######Image Variability\nIncludes images captured under varying environmental conditions and growth stages, ensuring robustness and generalization of classification models.\n\n##Potential Applications\n\n######Disease Detection\nEnables the development of machine learning models for automated detection and classification of plant diseases, aiding in early diagnosis and mitigation strategies.\n######Crop Management\nSupports precision agriculture initiatives by providing tools for monitoring and managing disease outbreaks, optimizing crop yield and quality.\n######Research and Education\nServes as a valuable resource for researchers, educators, and practitioners in plant pathology, fostering innovation and knowledge dissemination in the field.",
