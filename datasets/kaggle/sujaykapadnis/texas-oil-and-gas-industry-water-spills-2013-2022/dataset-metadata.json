  "descriptionNullable": "For a recent Inside Climate News investigation, Martha Pskowski and Peter Aldhous wrangled data on 10,000+ wastewater spills reported by oil and gas companies to the Texas government between 2013 and 2022. These \u201cspill logs\u201d \u2014 obtained through public records requests, then cleaned and standardized by the journalists \u2014 correspond to more than 148 million gallons of \u201cproduced water,\u201d a byproduct of drilling and fracking. The data indicate each spill\u2019s date, location, facility, operator, type of operation, volume of wastewater released, volume recovered, and much more.\n\n# Spills of produced water by the Texas oil and gas industry from 2013 to 2022\n\nData and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) code for the analysis underlying [this](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/31102023/oil-gas-companies-spill-wastewater-in-texas/) Inside Climate News article, analyzing a decade of spills in Texas of produced water \u2014 which emerges from wells along with crude oil and gas during fossil fuel extraction.\n\n### Data cleaning/processing\n\nRecords of these spills are maintained by the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas industry, in spreadsheets it calls \u201cspill logs.\u201d Through public records requests, we obtained logs held centrally by the Railroad Commission, and those held by the commission's individual district offices throughout the state.\n\nThe data required extensive cleaning in R, [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/), and Google Sheets to diagnose and fix problems including incorrectly entered dates, inconsistent units for volume, misaligned columns, duplicated entries, and multiple variants of company names, which we standardized for the largest operators. The centrally-held logs were maintained in spreadsheets with individual sheets or tabs named by month and year, allowing us to assign a month and year to any spills lacking a spill date.\n\nWhere volumes of produced water were given as greater than or less than a particular value, we used that value. Where a range was given, we used the midpoint of that range. In a small number of cases in which the volume of water recovered was shown as greater than the volume released, we corrected the volume recovered to equal the volume released. We multiplied all volumes given in barrels by 42 to give volumes in U.S. gallons, used for our analysis.\n\nThe spill logs documented releases of crude oil, condensates (hydrocarbons with a density less than that of crude oil), natural gas, and produced water, with some records involving spills of more than one substance simultaneously. For our analysis of spills of produced water, we filtered to remove records with no entry for the volume of produced water released, or with a value of zero, and to remove any spills that occured before or after the calendar years 2013 to 2022.\n\nThe cleaned and filtered data is in the two data input files described below.\n\n### Analysis\n\nOur analysis of the number and volume of releases of produced water based on the spill logs held centrally by the Railroad Commission is given [here](https://insideclimatenews.github.io/2023-10-tx-produced-water-spills/tx-spills-central.html) and in the file `tx-spills-central.Rmd`.
