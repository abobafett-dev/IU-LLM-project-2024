The data is crawled from their website, So there is no guarantee that this the exhaustive list of articles published in 2020, but I tried me best and managed to collect most of them. I created this data set to perform bunch of tasks like Text clustering, topic model, sentence classification, NER, Article recommendation etc. But at the moment I am sharing the raw data for exploring unsupervised learning techniques on it. I am planning to label the data for different supervised learning problems. Please up-vote if you guys appreciate the effort.\n\n### Content\n\nThe data-set has following attributes:\n- title\n- date published\n- description: a short summary of the article\n- Article per se\n- keywords\n",
