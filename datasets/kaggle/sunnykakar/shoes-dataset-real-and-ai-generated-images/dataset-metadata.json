The dataset is intended for research purposes in computer vision, machine learning, and related areas. It provides a diverse collection of images to facilitate developing and evaluating of algorithms, models, and techniques. I created this dataset from 3 separate Kaggle datasets (see references below) to use as a data source for training CNNs to predict AI-generated vs Real images of the same subject: SHOES.  \n\n## Contents\nThe dataset includes two main categories of images:\n1. **Real Images**: Images scraped from Google Images for Nike, Adidas, and Converse shoes. The source Kaggle dataset is linked below under references.\n2. **AI-Generated Images**: Images generated using MidJourney. The source Kaggle dataset is linked below under references.\n\nAll images are of dimension 240x240. The AI-generated images have been compressed and resized to the same dimensions as the Real Images. For full-resolution AI images, refer to the source dataset below under References  \n\n## Usage\nResearchers/Developers can utilize this dataset for the following purposes:\n- Training and evaluating image generation models.\n- Investigating the differences between real and AI-generated images.\n- Image classification, object detection, and image enhancement algorithms.\n- Exploring the challenges and opportunities in the synthesis of realistic images.\n\n## Citation\nIf you use this dataset in your research or projects, please consider citing this repository:\n\n```\n@misc{sunkakar,\ntitle={Shoes Dataset: Real and AI-Generated Images},\nauthor={Sundeep Kakar},\nyear={2024},\npublisher={GitHub},\nhowpublished={\\url{https://github.com/sunkakar/dataset-shoes-ai-generated}},\n}\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\nI acknowledge the contributors and sources of the real images used in this dataset. Additionally, we appreciate the efforts of researchers and developers who have created the AI-generated images. Their work has been instrumental in curating this dataset.\n\n## References\n- Dataset Inspired by: [CIFAKE: Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images)\n- AI-Generated Shoes: [Midjourney Shoe Dataset Week of May 5, 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikbearbrown/midjourney-shoe-dataset-week-of-may-5-2023)\n- Real Shoes: [Nike, Adidas, and Converse Shoes Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/die9origephit/nike-adidas-and-converse-imaged)\n\n## License\nThe dataset is provided under the MIT License.
