I then began keeping track of my daily physiological and exercise data. The following dataset contains the data of 150 such days. \nThe variables and their units are as follows:\n\n1. **distance** - the distance (in km) that I walked/jogged/ran basically total distance I traversed that day.\n2. **rhr** - resting heart rate (in bpm) for that day.\n3. **zone mins** - minutes of vigorous exercise for that day.\n\nI look forward to seeing what kinda insights people draw from this dataset and hopefully inspire others to exercise as well.",
