  "descriptionNullable": "A Dataset comprised of two parts, images generated by AI image generation models such as DALL-E and Midjourney, and real images known to be made by humans. The majority of AI generated images are artistic works of some type and not photorealistic because it was found that having more artistic works than photos in the human generated set yielded better test results. One major issue found when trying to train classifiers on this set is while a test accuracy as high as 94% was achieved, if the image (regardless of source AI or human) contained noise such as a film grain or fur there was a higher error rate and the image was more likely to be mislabeled as AI generated. My theory is because diffusion image generation models (DALL-E etc.) start with random noise and turn it into an image based on the prompt, so the classifier could be using the noise of the image as a way to detect Ai generated art and by adding noise the model is getting confused. One possible solution to this is using image denoising on the image or edge detection however I have yet to test either. \n\n\n## Benefits over other datasets\n\nThe benefit of this dataset compared to other artificially generated image datasets (such as CIFAKE) is that all images are in there original size and aspect ratio.\n\n",
