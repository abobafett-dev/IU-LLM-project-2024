As a consequence, finding relevant articles has become more difficult. Tagging or topic modelling provides a way to give token of identification to research articles which facilitates recommendation and search process.\n\nGiven the abstract and title for a set of research articles, predict the topics for each article included in the test set. \n\nNote that a research article can possibly have more than 1 topic. The research article abstracts and titles are sourced from the following 6 topics: \n\n1. Computer Science\n\n2. Physics\n\n3. Mathematics\n\n4. Statistics\n\n5. Quantitative Biology\n\n6. Quantitative Finance\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nSince the lockdown was announced in the country back in March, we started with a 1 day hackathon called Janatahack inspired from Janata cerfew to start our war against the pandemic.  Looking at the amazing response and demand for more, we continued the hackathons over the weekends every week. Janatahack today is a phenomena where loads of esteemed members of our community regularly participate to showcase their machine learning skills by sharing their approaches and more important to learn how to apply machine learning and predictive analytics to new domains such as agriculture, Banking, IOT, forecasting and so on. \n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nHackathon",
