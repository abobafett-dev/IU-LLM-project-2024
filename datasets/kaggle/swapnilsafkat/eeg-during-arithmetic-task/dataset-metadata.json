A high-pass filter with a 30 Hz cut-off frequency and a power line notch filter (50 Hz) were used. All recordings are artifact-free EEG segments of 60 seconds duration. At the stage of data preprocessing, the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was used to eliminate the artifacts.\n\n## Data \n\n#### The data files with EEG are provided in EDF (European Data Format) format. Each subject has 2 files:\n####   with \"_1\" suffix -- the recording of the background EEG of a subject (before mental arithmetic task)\n####   with \"_2\" suffix -- the recording of EEG during the mental arithmetic task.\n\n#### In this experiment all subjects are divided into two groups:\n#### Group \"G\" (24 subjects) performing good quality count (Mean number of operations per 4 minutes = 21, SD = 7.4).\n####Group \"B\" (12 subjects) performing bad quality count (Mean number of operations per 4 minutes = 7, SD = 3.6).\n\nIn subject-info.csv, the \"Count quality\" column indicates which subjects correspond to which group (0 - Group \"B\", 1 - Group \"G\"). Additionally, subject-info.csv provides basic information about each subject (gender, age, job, date of recording).\n\n##Contributors\nThis database was contributed by Igor Zyma, Sergii Tukaev, and Ivan Seleznov, National Technical University of Ukraine \"Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute\", Department of Electronic Engineering.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n    Ivan Seleznov\n    National Technical University of Ukraine \"Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute\", Department of Electronic Engineering.\n    ivan.seleznov1@gmail.com",
