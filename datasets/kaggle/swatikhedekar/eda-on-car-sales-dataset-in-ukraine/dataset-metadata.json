This is subset of all car data in Ukraine. Using this we will analyze the various parameter of used car sales in Ukraine.\n\n\n1.1 Introduction:\nThis Exploratory Data Analysis is to practice python skills till now on a structured dataset including loading, inspecting,wrangling,Exploring and drawing conclusions from the data.The notebook has the obeservations with each step in order to explain throughtly how to approach the dataset. Based on the obseravation some quetions also are answered in the notebook for the reference though not all them are explored in the analysis.\n\n\n1.2 Data Source and Dataset:\na. How was it collected?\n\nName: Car Sales\nSponsering Organization: Dont Know!\nYear :2019\nDescription: This is case study of more than 9.5k car sales in Ukraine.\nb. it is sample?
