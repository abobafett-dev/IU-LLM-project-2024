This repository also contains the modeling codes and will be updated continually, so welcome starring or watching!\n\nStock market data can be interesting to analyze and as a further incentive, strong predictive models can have large financial payoff. The amount of financial data on the web is seemingly endless. A large and well structured dataset on a wide array of companies can be hard to come by. Here provided a dataset with historical stock prices (last 12 years) for 29 of 30 DJIA companies (excluding 'V' because it does not have the whole 12 years data).\n\n          ['MMM', 'AXP', 'AAPL', 'BA', 'CAT', 'CVX', 'CSCO', 'KO', 'DIS', 'XOM', 'GE',\n\n          'GS', 'HD', 'IBM', 'INTC', 'JNJ', 'JPM', 'MCD', 'MRK', 'MSFT', 'NKE', 'PFE',\n\n          'PG', 'TRV', 'UTX', 'UNH', 'VZ', 'WMT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'AABA']\n\nIn the future if you wish for a more up to date dataset, this can be used to acquire new versions of the .csv files.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe data is presented in a couple of formats to suit different individual's needs or computational limitations. \nI have included files containing 13 years of stock data (in the all_stocks_2006-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv and corresponding folder) and\na smaller version of the dataset (all_stocks_2017-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv) with only the past year's stock data for those wishing to use something more manageable in size.\n\nThe folder individual_stocks_2006-01-01_to_2018-01-01 contains files of data for individual stocks, labelled by their stock ticker name. \nThe all_stocks_2006-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv and all_stocks_2017-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv contain this same data, presented in merged .csv files. \nDepending on the intended use (graphing, modelling etc.) the user may prefer one of these given formats.\n\nAll the files have the following columns:\nDate - in format: yy-mm-dd \n\nOpen - price of the stock at market open (this is NYSE data so all in USD)\n\nHigh - Highest price reached in the day\n\nLow\tClose - Lowest price reached in the day\n\nVolume - Number of shares traded\n\nName - the stock's ticker name\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThis dataset lends itself to a some very interesting visualizations. One can look at simple things like how prices change over time, graph an compare multiple stocks at once, or generate and graph new metrics from the data provided.\nFrom these data informative stock stats such as volatility and moving averages can be easily calculated.\nThe million dollar question is: can you develop a model that can beat the market and allow you to make statistically informed trades!\n\n### Acknowledgement \n\nThis Data description is adapted from the dataset named 'S&amp;P 500 Stock data'.\nThis data is scrapped from Google finance using the python library 'pandas_datareader'.
