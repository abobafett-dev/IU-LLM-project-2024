The experiment and the significance of the various scales used in the evaluation were explained to each participant. The following methods were used to create a presentation featuring photos of 40 different cuisines: \n- Displaying each food for 10 seconds\n- Display of tranquil scenario following each food image for 17 seconds to counteract the influence of one image leading to the next\n- In the meantime, self-assessment of Likeness, Valence and Arousal\n\nTo collect EEG data, we put a headset directly on the participant's scalp.

The food presentation featured both large feasts and little appetizers. Everything has been covered, from basic staples like rice and chicken curry to popular fast-food options like burgers and pizza.
