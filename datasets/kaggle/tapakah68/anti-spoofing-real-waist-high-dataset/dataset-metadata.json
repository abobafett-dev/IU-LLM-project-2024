  "descriptionNullable": "# Biometric Attack dataset - Waist-High Videos\nThe anti spoofing dataset consists of waist-high selfies and video of real people. The videos were gathered by capturing faces of genuine individuals presenting spoofs, using facial presentations. Our dataset proposes a novel approach that learns and detects spoofing techniques, extracting features from the genuine facial images to prevent the capturing of such information by fake users.\n\nThe dataset contains images and videos of real humans with various **resolutions, views, and colors**, making it a comprehensive resource for researchers working on anti-spoofing technologies.\n\n# \ud83d\udcb4 For Commercial Usage: To discuss your requirements, learn about the price and buy the dataset, leave a request on **[TrainingData](https://trainingdata.pro/datasets/anti-spoofing-real?utm_source=kaggle&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=anti-spoofing-real-waist-high-dataset)** to buy the dataset\n\n### The dataset includes 2 different types of files:\n- **Photo** - a selfie of a person from a mobile phone, the person is depicted alone on it, the face is clearly visible. Person is presented waist-high.\n- **Video** - filmed on the front camera, on which a person moves his/her head left, right, up and down.

These solutions are crucial as newer devices, such as phones, have become vulnerable to spoofing attacks due to the availability of technologies that can create replays, reflections, and depths, making them susceptible to spoofing and generalization.\n\nOur dataset also explores the use of neural architectures, such as deep neural networks, to facilitate the identification of distinguishing patterns and textures in different regions of the face, increasing the accuracy and generalizability of the anti-spoofing models.\n\n# Content\n- The folder **\"photo\"** includes selfies of people\n- The folder **\"video\"** includes videos of people\n\n\n### File with the extension .csv\nincludes the following information for each media file:\n\n- **photo**: link to access the selfie,\n- **video**: link to access the video,\n- **phone**: the device used to capture selfie and video,\n- **gender**: gender of a person,\n- **age**: age of the person,\n- **country**: country of the person\n\n# \ud83d\udcb4 Buy the Dataset: This is just an example of the data.
