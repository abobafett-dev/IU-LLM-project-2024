Our dataset proposes a novel approach that learns and detects spoofing techniques, extracting features from the genuine facial images to prevent the capturing of such information by fake users.\n\nThe dataset contains images and videos of real humans with various **resolutions, views, and colors**, making it a comprehensive resource for researchers working on anti-spoofing technologies.\n\n# \ud83d\udcb4 For Commercial Usage: Full version of the dataset includes 98,000+ files, leave a request on **[TrainingData](https://trainingdata.pro/datasets/anti-spoofing-real?utm_source=kaggle&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=anti-spoofing)** to buy the dataset\n\n# Content\n\nThe dataset includes 4 folders:\n\n- cut-out printouts - videos with cut-out printouts \n- live_selfie -  selfies with unique people\n- live_video - videos with unique people\n- printouts - videos with A4 printouts\n- replay - videos of videos in replay\n\nThe dataset provides data to combine and apply different techniques, approaches, and models to address the challenging task of distinguishing between genuine and spoofed inputs, providing effective anti-spoofing solutions in active authentication systems. These solutions are crucial as newer devices, such as phones, have become vulnerable to spoofing attacks due to the availability of technologies that can create replays, reflections, and depths, making them susceptible to spoofing and generalization.\n\nOur dataset also explores the use of neural architectures, such as deep neural networks, to facilitate the identification of distinguishing patterns and textures in different regions of the face, increasing the accuracy and generalizability of the anti-spoofing models.\n\n![](https://sun9-86.userapi.com/impg/QAf1WkODGdeieXN8IWT0VAmsX0IusL6ToxjGTw/7Elubi9TsAs.jpg?size=2560x926&quality=95&sign=d6a86575c8547c769894c0bb7521dcba&type=album)\n\n# \ud83d\udcb4 Buy the Dataset: This is just an example of the data.
