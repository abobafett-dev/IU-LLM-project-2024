No notable hair loss or recession of the hairline.\n- **type_2**: There is a small recession of the hairline around the temples. Hair is also lost, or sparse, along the midfrontal border of the scalp, but the depth of the affected area is much less than in the frontoparietal regions. This is commonly referred to as an adult or mature hairline.\n- **type_3**: The first signs of significant balding appear. There is a deep, symmetrical recession at the temples that are only sparsely covered by hair.\n- **type_4**: The hairline recession is harsher than in stage 2, and there is scattered hair or no hair on the vertex. There are deep frontotemporal recessions, usually symmetrical, and are either bare or very sparsely covered by hair.\n- **type_5**: The areas of hair loss are more significant than in stage 4. They are still divided, but the band of hair between them is thinner and sparser.\n- **type_6**: The connection of hair that crosses the crown is gone with only sparse hair remaining. The frontotemporal and vertex regions are joined together, and the extent of hair loss is more significant.\n- **type_7**: The most drastic stage of hair loss, only a band of hair, going around the sides of the head persists. This hair usually is not thick and might be dainty.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F618942%2F9ecea1768d64ac8444d74ad3c068160b%2F.png?generation=1686041157081408&alt=media)\n\n# Data Format\n\nEach image from `img` folder is accompanied by an XML-annotation in the `annotations.xml` file indicating the Hamilton\u2013Norwood type of hairloss for each person in the dataset.\n\n# Example of XML file structure\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F618942%2F65fe0cc71ef8761886faf32a392f6a58%2F.png?generation=1686042340119038&alt=media)\n\n# \ud83d\udcb4 Buy the Dataset: This is just an example of the data.
