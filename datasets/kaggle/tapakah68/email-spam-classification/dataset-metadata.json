These emails often contain misleading subject lines, excessive use of advertisements, unauthorized links, or attempts to collect personal information.\n\nThe **non-spam emails** in the dataset are genuine and legitimate messages sent by individuals or organizations. They may include personal or professional communication, newsletters, transaction receipts, or any other non-malicious content.\n\nThe dataset encompasses emails of varying *lengths, languages, and writing styles*, reflecting the inherent heterogeneity of email communication.
