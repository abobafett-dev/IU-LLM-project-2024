The dataset includes: **replay attacks** - videos of real people played on a computer and filmed on the phone.\n\nThe videos were gathered by capturing faces of genuine individuals presenting spoofs, using facial presentations. Our dataset proposes a novel approach that learns and detects spoofing techniques, extracting features from the genuine facial images to prevent the capturing of such information by fake users.\n\nThe dataset contains images and videos of real humans with various **resolutions, views, and colors**, making it a comprehensive resource for researchers working on anti-spoofing technologies.\n\n# \ud83d\udcb4 For Commercial Usage: To discuss your requirements, learn about the price and buy the dataset, leave a request on **[TrainingData](https://trainingdata.pro/datasets/anti-spoofing-replay?utm_source=kaggle&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=macbook-attacks)** to buy the dataset\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F618942%2F01a9fdf5d12367b2466bb859b18f7b93%2FUntitled.png?generation=1688045197310243&alt=media)\n\nThe dataset provides data to combine and apply different techniques, approaches, and models to address the challenging task of distinguishing between genuine and spoofed inputs, providing effective anti-spoofing solutions in active authentication systems.
