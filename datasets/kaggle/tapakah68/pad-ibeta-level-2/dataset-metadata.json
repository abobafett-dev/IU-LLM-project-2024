  "descriptionNullable": "# iBeta Level 2 Liveness Detection, Anti spoofing dataset\nThe biometric attack dataset consists of six diffrent types of videos: real face videos, 2D mask attacks with and without eyes cutting, 3D cardboard attacks, attacks with latex and silicon masks. \n\nThe dataset comprises videos of genuine facial presentations using various methods, including 3D masks and photos, as well as real and spoof faces. It proposes a novel approach that learns and extracts facial features to prevent spoofing attacks, based on deep neural networks and advanced biometric techniques.\n\nOur results show that this technology works effectively in securing most applications and prevents unauthorized access by distinguishing between genuine and spoofed inputs. Additionally, it addresses the challenging task of identifying unseen spoofing cues, making it one of the most effective techniques in the field of anti-spoofing research.\n\n# \ud83d\udcb4 For Commercial Usage: To discuss your requirements, learn about the price and buy the dataset, leave a request on **[TrainingData](https://trainingdata.pro/datasets/liveness-detection-for-ibeta-level-2?utm_source=kaggle&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=pad-ibeta-level-2)** to buy the dataset\n\n### All the attacks enabled the liveness detection system to pass the iBeta testing at level 2.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F618942%2F60f0fd80032a07a3f84c5bad431ad804%2FTD_ibeta_v_9%20(3)-9-1.png?generation=1687976769447161&alt=media)\n\n# iBeta Level 1 Testing\n## The iBeta Level 1 Liveness Detection Dataset: [Link to the Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trainingdatapro/ibeta-level-1-liveness-detection-dataset-part-1)\n\n## Attributes \nThe videos were filmed on various backgrounds and using additional accessories such as faked facial hair, scarves, hats, and others. \n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F618942%2F134bb43c43b170a592d6ebb881704c39%2FTD_ibeta_v_9%20(3)-10-1.png?generation=1687976927506960&alt=media)\n\n## Details\nThere are 21 unique persons in the dataset.
