It has total 500 sounds. Each sound is 1 second in duration.\nAmong the 500 snoring samples, 363 samples consist of snoring sounds of children, adult men and adult women without any background sound. The remaining 137 samples consist of snoring sounds having a background of non-snoring sounds. \n\n\nFolder 0 contains non-snoring sounds. It has total 500 sounds. Each sound is 1 second in duration.\nThe 500 non-snoring samples consist of background sounds that might be available near the snorer. Ten categories of non-snoring sounds are collected, and each category has 50 samples. The ten categories are baby crying, the clock ticking, the door opened and closed, total silence and the minor sound of the vibration motor of the gadget, toilet flashing, siren of emergency vehicle, rain and thunderstorm, streetcar sounds, people talking, and background television news.\n\n**Citation**\n=======\nIf you use the dataset, then please cite the following work:\nT.
