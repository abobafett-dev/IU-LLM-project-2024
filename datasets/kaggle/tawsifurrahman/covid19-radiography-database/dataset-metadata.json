This COVID-19, normal, and other lung infection dataset is released in stages. In the first release,  we have released 219 COVID-19, 1341 normal, and 1345 viral pneumonia chest X-ray (CXR) images. In the first update, we have increased the COVID-19 class to 1200 CXR images. In the 2nd update, we have increased the database to 3616 COVID-19 positive cases along with 10,192 Normal, 6012 Lung Opacity (Non-COVID lung infection), and 1345 Viral Pneumonia images and corresponding lung masks. We will continue to update this database as soon as we have new x-ray images for COVID-19 pneumonia patients.  \n### Please find the link for downloading the whole dataset: [Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bum9Sehb3AzUMHLhBMuowPKyr_PCrB3a/view?usp=sharing)\n\n#### **Our New Dataset**\n**COVID-QU-Ex Dataset\n**The researchers of Qatar University have compiled the COVID-QU-Ex dataset, which consists of 33,920 chest X-ray (CXR) images including:\n11,956 COVID-19, 11,263 Non-COVID infections (Viral or Bacterial Pneumonia), and 10,701 Normal\nGround-truth lung segmentation masks are provided for the entire dataset. This is the largest ever created lung mask dataset.\nBesides, 2,913 COVID-19 Infection Segmentation masks are provided from our previous QaTaCov project.\n \nIf you would like to download the COVID-QU-Ex dataset, then please check our new Kaggle repository:\nhttps://doi.org/10.34740/kaggle/dsv/3122958\n\n### Please cite the following two articles if you are using this dataset:\n-M.E.H.
