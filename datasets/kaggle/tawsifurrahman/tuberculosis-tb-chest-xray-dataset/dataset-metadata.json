In our current release, there are 700 TB images publicly accessible and 2800 TB images can be downloaded from NIAID TB portal[3] by signing an agreement, and 3500 normal images. \n\nNote: -The research team managed to classify TB and Normal Chest X-ray images with an accuracy of 98.3%. This scholarly work is published in IEEE Access.
