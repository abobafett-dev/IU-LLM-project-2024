Generally, they use that data to classify writers according to their writing styles.

But, I wanted to solve this problem by Deep learning using Keras and Tensorflow. For the purpose, we don't need the full IAM Handwriting Dataset, but some authentic subset which can be used for training such as a subset of images by top 50 persons who contributed the most towards the dataset.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains images of each handwritten sentence with the dash-separated filename format. The first field represents the test code, second the writer id, third passage id, and fourth the sentence id.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset won't be here without the help of FKI Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence.
