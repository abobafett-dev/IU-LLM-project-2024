  "descriptionNullable": "# Introduction\nBoo and Simba are two cool cats with a twitter account! Can you tell them apart?\n\nBoo and Simba have been tweeting for over 7 years on the [@boosimba twitter account](https://twitter.com/boosimba). Or to be more precise, *Catmon* - a catflap monitoring application - tweets the cat\u2019s image when a cat enters the house through the catflap.\n\n# Aim\nThe aim of this dataset is to provide a sufficient number of tagged images to allow Boo and Simba to be automatically identified by a machine learning application.\n\n# Dataset Structure\nThe *catmon_input* folder contains three folders: boo, simba and unknown. These folder names correspond to the 3 candidate image labels. \n\nThe boo folder contains 1000 images of Boo, a fluffy domestic cat. \n\nThe simba folder contains 1000 images of Simba, a wiry domestic cat. \n\nThe unknown folder contains 793 images in which Boo or Simba cannot be identified. These are mostly images that are too dark, though some are \u2018ghost\u2019 images in which no cat is present.\n\nEach image is 640 x 480 (w x h) pixels. The size varies but is typically about 200 KB.\n\nThe image filename gives the date and time the image was captured by *Catmon*. For example the image *2021-04-29_145458.jpg* was captured on 29th April 2021 at 14:54:58. \n\nThe time of day effects the brightness of the image. *Catmon* is supported by a motion-sensitive light that isn\u2019t always quick enough to illuminate the scene. Many of the night images are therefore too dark to identify a cat. The lighting has recently been upgraded.\n\n# New Data\n*Catmon* continues to tweet new cat images every day on the \\@boosimba twitter account.\n\n# References\n1.
