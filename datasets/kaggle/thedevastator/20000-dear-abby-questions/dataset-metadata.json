Drawing from articles published around the United States between 1985 to 2017, this data reveals a wealth of information about the anxieties and concerns of ordinary citizens during that time period. \n> \n> The topics covered can be grouped into three main categories: sex education and relationships; LGBTQ issues; and religious queries. Questions regarding parents, children, friends, bosses, etc fill out the rest of our corpus. This data offers an interesting glimpse into the collective experiences of people living in America during these decades - showing how different issues have risen up over time or evolved in their representation - as well as offering insights on how people resorted to Dear Abby for advice on problems both mundane and extraordinary during these years. \n> \n> If you're looking for meaningful datasets with conversations on human connection or seeking a better understanding of American history beyond current headlines - then this is your one-stop source!

This includes year, month day and url which provide information about when and where the particular question was published; as well as title which provides overlap about when/where a question was published; and lastly question_only which includes only the text of each individual submitted question itself. \n> \n> - Consider Your Topic: Think broadly about what you are most interested in exploring through this data as it gives us direct insight into topics that Americans have been struggling with over time (such as LGBTQ issues or religion). Some ideas for questions might include \u201chow has anxiety around a certain topic changed over time?\u201d or \u201cwhat are people most struggling with today?\u201d Also consider specific keywords related to your topic \u2013 Dear Abby discussions sex may include words such as sexual harassment or infidelity while keywords exploring LGBTQ issues may include transgender or same-sex marriage \u2013 since you\u2019ll likely use them in your analysis moving forward!   \n> \n> - Perform Your Analysis:  Now that you know what columns matter most & what questions you want answered; it\u2019s time to start performing your analysis! In order to get meaningful results out of your findings be sure make sure measure several points (e.g., mean values) along larger trends over different timelines throughout history such as 5 year intervals or looking at specific decades on their own). You can also manually group questions into categories when appropriate so that navigating complex topics becomes easier & more streamlined from an end user perspective (or further pursue techniques like t-SNE). \n> \n> - Visualize Your Findings: Use any form of visualization tools (such trends graphs/charts) \u2013 e specially those available through Kaggle \u2013 for easier consumption of whatever insights its pulled out form these 20k submissions! As mentioned before these visualizations will allow you understand macro (& micro!) trends between a given topic an countless other social ones without having read even 1 entire single letter yourself .     \n> \n> 5 . Share Your Insights : It isn't just enough knowing how Americans felt during certain\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Social and Cultural Trends Analysis: This data can be used to analyze the changes in social and cultural trends over the 30-year period, such as identifying topics that were more prominent at certain times.\n> - Characterization of Reader Demographics: By analysing this dataset, we can gain insight into the demographics of Dear Abby's readers (e.g., age groupings, gender, location). \n> - Building a Natural Language Understanding Model: The data can be used to create a natural language understanding model that could accurately predict answers based on questions submitted by readers\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/kgarrett)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: raw_da_qs.csv**\n| Column name       | Description                                                      |\n|:------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **year**          | The year the question was asked.
