It includes information such as location, average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, state name, state code, and zip code. All the data contained in this dataset has been filtered so that any values equaling -999 were removed. With this powerful set of data you to explore how climate conditions changed throughout the year and how they varied across different regions of the country. Dive into your own research today to uncover fascinating climate trends or use it to further narrow your studies specific to a region or city\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset offers a detailed look at daily average, minimum, and maximum temperatures across the United States. It contains information from 1120 weather stations throughout the year to provide a comprehensive look at temperature trends for the year. \n&gt; \n&gt; The data contains a variety of columns including station, station name, location (latitude and longitude), state name zip code and date. The primary focus of this dataset is on the AvgTemp, MaxTemp and MinTemp columns which provide daily average, maximum and minimum temperature records respectively in degrees Fahrenheit.\n&gt; \n&gt; To use this dataset effectively it is useful to consider multiple views before undertaking any analysis or making conclusions:  \n&gt; - Plot each individual record versus time by creating a line graph with stations as labels on different lines indicating changes over time.  Doing so can help identify outliers that may need further examination;  much like viewing data on a scatterplot looking for confidence bands or examining variance between points that are otherwise hard to see when all points are plotted on one graph only.  \n&gt; - A comparison of states can be made through creating grouped bar charts where states are grouped together with Avg/Max/Min temperatures included within each chart - thereby showing any variance that may exist between states during a specific period about which it's possible to make observations about themselves (rather than comparing them).  For example - you could observe if there was an abnormally high temperature increase in California during July compared with other US states since all measurements would be represented visually providing opportunity for insights quickly compared with having to manually calculate figures from raw data sets only.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  With these two initial approaches there will also be further visualizations possible regarding correlations between particular geographical areas versus different climatic conditions or through population analysis such as correlating areas warmer/colder than median observances verses relative population densities etc.. providing additional opportunities for investigation particularly when combined with key metrics collected over multiple years versus one single year's results exclusively allowing wider inferences to be made depending upon what is being requested in terms of outcomes desired from those who may explore this data set further down the line beyond its original compilation starter point here today!\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Using the Latitude and Longitude values, this dataset can be used to create a map of average temperatures across the USA. This would be useful for seeing which areas were consistently hotter or colder than others throughout the year.\n&gt; - Using the AvgTemp and StateName columns, predictors could use regression modeling to predict what temperature an area will have in a given month based on it's average temperature. \n&gt; - By using the Date column and plotting it alongside MaxTemp or MinTemp values, visualization methods such as timelines could be utilized to show how temperatures changed during different times of year across various states in the US\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/mattwinter225)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **Unknown License - Please check the dataset description for more information.**\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: 2015 USA Weather Data FINAL.csv**\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit [Matthew Winter](https://data.world/mattwinter225).\n\n",
