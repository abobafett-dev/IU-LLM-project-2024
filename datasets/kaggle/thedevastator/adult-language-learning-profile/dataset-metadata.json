Drawing from results collected over several decades, it is a rich source for studying the relationship between language proficiency and various individual characteristics, such as native language, country of origin, age at arrival of residence in the Netherlands, length of residence in the Netherlands, days spent on formal education in Dutch as a second language, gender identity and family status. The dataset also includes scores from sections of an exam given to assess Dutch proficiency - speaking performance score; lexical score; morphology score; and new sounds/features section. With its abundance of data points identifying vital metrics related to language learning success stories globally this invaluable resource offers an exciting opportunity to uncover previously unseen correlations\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> - Understand the Columns - You should take time to understand what each column in the dataset represents. Each column contains information such as a participant\u2019s native language (L1), country of origin (C), linguistic similarity between native and target language (L1L2), age at arrival in the Netherlands (AaA), length of residence In the Netherlands (LoR) among other characteristics which are all necessary for analysis. Read through all columns before beginning any analysis or review so that you understand how they all fit together and how they relate to each other. \n> \n> - Focus on Key Data - Identify which key variables can provide valuable insights into your research question such as speaking score, morphological score, and new sound score etc. These elements will help create a comprehensive overview of adult language learning understanding profile pronunciation and grammatical ability therefore these variables should be considered when retrieving data from this set.  \n>  \n> - Select Descriptive Statistics - If you want to get an experience view about levels of proficiency among different groups use descriptive statistics like mean & median or frequency tables with counts & percentages for powerful analyses . This type of analysis helps identify any underlying trends or patterns related to various factors that influence adult learning outcomes such as sex or native language background etc.. Additionally conducting correlation tests focusing on key variables provides deeper insight across different languages & national backgrounds  \n> \n> 4 Flexibility with Tools - Use various tools like pivot tables , visualizations or clustering algorithms , these will allow greater flexibility when analyzing data from this dataset . Also try using summary tools like chi-square test , ANOVA testing & regression modeling providing more meaningful results depending upon what kind inquiry you want answers too .   \n> \n> By following these tips, you will be able to effectively use this dataset in order better understand how individuals learn new languages as adults in Netherlands\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - It can be used to identify correlations between linguistic similarity, length of residence in the Netherlands, and language proficiency. \n> - It can be used to explore the differences in language proficiency amongst different gender and family statuses. \n> - It can be used to create targeted educational programs for adult language learners based on their native languages, ages of arrival in the Netherlands, and other characteristics\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/2863533#.Y9Y3pNJBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
