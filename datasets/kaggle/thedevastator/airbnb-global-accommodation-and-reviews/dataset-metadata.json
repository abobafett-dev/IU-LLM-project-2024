Use this dataset to explore how guests rate their experiences, discover new places in various neighbourhood groups and geographical locations, compare prices of different room types, consider minimum nights required for bookings and more! With this data set you can evaluate factors associated with: host name; neighbourhood group; latitude & longitude; room type; price; minimum nights required for bookings; number of reviews - both in total and over the last 12 months (number_of_reviews_ltm); license (if applicable); last review received; average number of reviews per month (reviews per month) as well as calculated host listing counts which reflect seasonal demand variations. With this information at your fingertips you could travel anywhere your heart desires - so let's turn those dreams into reality!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> The following guide will help you get started in your journey to gain insights from this data set. \n>  \n> First, specify the fields that you want to focus on. In order to do this, make sure you take into consideration the columns available within this dataset.  By doing so, not only are you able to hone in on specific aspects of Airbnb accommodation and reviews (i.e neighborhood groups, room types or even pricing), but also identify themes or common trends among listings which could prove useful when formulating hypotheses.   \n>  \n> Once you have identified which fields will be useful for analysis, it is important that they are converted into appropriate data types if they need any sort of conversion at all (i.e converting strings to integers). Moreover, make sure there are no inconsistencies across your features when exploring the entries in those columns; take care of them before any substantial analysis is done.  \n> \n> You are now ready for some exploratory analysis! Start by creating visualizations such as bar graphs or box plots in order to get an overview of particular aspects related to listings (i.e distribution of prices around a neighbourhood group) - these can be very useful indicators! Then try out correlations between different exponential variable datasets such as availability_365 versus minimum_nightsand explore how they fluctuate with changes in pricing over time - examining how these relationships relate over different locations can yield interesting results like unexpected concentration points which demand research! Another field worth exploring would be reviews associated with each listing by digging down into their components like ratings breakdowns under different criteria such as security/price value ratio etc.. All these evaluations should give an excellent outline on what potential customers might look out for while browsing through options online so as entrepreneurs we can hover upon those trends specially mentioning needs fulfilled during our advertisement campains....   Lastly examine publicly available information about each host such as number_of_reviews or calculated_listings count variation over time , with ability provided here we have ample opportunities predicting customer opinion about newly created businesses offering same services...so many things one could dive deep !    \n> \n> Overall , after gaining ample amount insights taking about current market scenario it\u2019s best suggested procuring feedback from active host & using it devise plans bringing mutual mutually beneficial solutions making both hosts & guests happy . This is where creativity play huge role designing perks forming long lasting trust inducing relationship between service providers &\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Predicting price points for Airbnb listings based on factors such as room type, neighborhood group, and reviews. \n> - Identifying areas with a high demand for Airbnb rentals, by looking at the ratio of availability to number of reviews for listings in different neighborhoods.\n> - Analyzing guest satisfaction levels based on factors such as room type and location, by correlating the reviews_per_month with the number_of_reviews indicator and other variables in the dataset\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/devdataanalyst)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Airbnb_listings.csv**\n| Column name                        | Description                                                                                  |\n|:-----------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **name**                           | Name of the Airbnb listing.
