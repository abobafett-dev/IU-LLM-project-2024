From field surveys conducted across 60 study plots, this dataset contains information on 239 species of alien plants, 20 risk-assessed organisms and 115 new species to Norway. Utilizing DNA-metabarcode data collected from a single Malaise trap as well as 3-4 rounds of repeated sampling, this dataset enables us to assess distribution patterns and risk factors associated with alien species in Norway. Additionally, FieldsFullDepth, FieldsShallowDepth, Forest, Freshwater, Housing, Mire, OpenLand Watersheds data was also included to analyze general plot conditions as well as environmental factor that could impact the distribution and risk assessment of such organisms.

It includes data from 60 survey plots located in three counties in the Oslofjord region. The dataset encompasses the presence of 239 species of alien plants, 20 risk-assessed organisms, and 115 species not previously seen in Norway. This data can be used to identify potential hotspots for alien species, as well as investigate factors such as climate conditions, population density, land use type and more which may be associated with their abundance or distribution. \n> \n> The columns include different features associated with each analysis to help identify trends that may exist between the presence of certain alien species and environmental variables. For example: \n> - **CorrectRisk**: Risk assessment categories associated with each observed taxon  \n> - **CorrectSpecies**: Species identified within each study plot \n> - **location**: Location details associated with each site surveyed \n> - **site**: Site/survey plot references  \n> - **AndersO** / ***HanneH*** : Presence indicator for whether a specific individual recorded a given taxon or not  \n> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0( With AndersO & HanneH present, researcher identification will allow trend comparisons per researcher )    \n> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a7 ^This will allow comparison of competence between researchers if necessary)  \n> \u00a0 - **Year** : Year at which sites were sampled by specific individuals      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  -^ This promotes trend comparison over periods      \n> \n>  In addition to these observations visualisations using this data might represent how existing resources may relate to areas that should focus more attention due to potential sites for concerned taxa influx (e.g., heavily populated areas). Exploratory analyses can also uncover environmental conditions both within surveyed plots; and outside surrounding study sites which affects our understanding on why certain species are observed versus others. Such analyses notably include measures measuring temperature & precipitation etc.. By considering all variables collaboratively it is possible that unforeseen associations could potentially shed light on risk factors underlying the extinction/colonisation behaviours managed by man or nature\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Identifying Hotspots of Alien Species: Analyzing the spatial distribution of alien species over time could give us valuable insights into the current and future hotspots for specific species, helping us better allocate resources for those regions where early detection and management is most important.\n> - Predicting Risk Factors Associated With Certain Species: The dataset can be used to determine which environmental conditions may be influencing population growth or decline of certain species, helping us identify unique elements associated with their invasion risk or successful establishment in breeding populations. \n> - Developing a Species Body Condition Index: Through understanding the temporal changes in abundance and physiology of individual species, a body condition index can be developed which can aid early detection of non-native invasions in Norway by providing an indication of health complexity and food availability across seasons and climate conditions that could impact survival rates when coupled with other non-chemical parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen levels in water bodies or mammal counts at different land use types such as housing, open land etc\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/7342686#.Y9Y72tJBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
