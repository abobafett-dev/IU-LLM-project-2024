Drawing from the immense pool of over 35 million customer reviews, this dataset presents a broad spectrum of customer opinions on products they have bought or used. This invaluable data is a gold mine for improving products and services as it contains comprehensive information regarding customers' experiences with a product including ratings, titles, and plaintext content. At the same time, this dataset contains both customer-specific data along with product information which encourages deep analytics that could lead to great advances in providing tailored solutions for customers. Has your product been favored by the majority? Are there any aspects that need extra care? Use Amazon Reviews Polarity to gain deeper insights into what your customers want - explore now!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> - Analyze customer ratings to identify trends: Take a look at how many customers have rated the same product or service with the same score (e.g., 4 stars). You can use this information to identify what customers like or don\u2019t like about it by examining common sentiment throughout the reviews. Identifying these patterns can help you make decisions on which features of your products or services to emphasize in order to boost sales and satisfaction rates. \n>  \n> 2 Review content analysis: Analyzing review content is one of the best ways to gauge customer sentiment toward specific features or aspects of a product/service. Using natural language processing tools such as Word2Vec, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), or even simple keyword search algorithms can quickly reveal general topics that are discussed in relation to your product/service across multiple reviews - allowing you quickly pinpoint areas that may need improvement for particular items within your lines of business. \n>   \n> 3 Track associated scores over time: By tracking customer ratings overtime, you may be able to better understand when there has been an issue with something specific related to your product/service - such as negative response toward a feature that was introduced but didn\u2019t seem popular among customers and was removed shortly after introduction.. This can save time and money by identifying issues before they become widespread concerns with larger sets of consumers who invest their money in using your company's item(s). \n> \n> 4 Visualize sentiment data over time graphs : Utilizing visualizations such as bar graphs can help identify trends across different categories quicker than raw numbers alone; combining both numeric values along with color differences associated between different scores allows you spot anomalies easier - allowing faster resolution times when trying figure out why certain spikes occurred where other stayed stable (or vice-versa) when comparing similar data points through time-series based visualization models\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Developing a customer sentiment analysis system that can be used to quickly analyze the sentiment of reviews and identify any potential areas of improvement. \n> - Building a product recommendation service that takes into account the ratings and reviews of customers when recommending similar products they may be interested in purchasing. \n> - Training a machine learning model to accurately predict customers\u2019 ratings on new products they have not yet tried and leverage this for further product development optimization initiatives\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amazon_polarity)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
