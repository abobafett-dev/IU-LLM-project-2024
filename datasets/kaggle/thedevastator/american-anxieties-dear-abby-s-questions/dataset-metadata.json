It was used in The Pudding essay titled 30 Years of American Anxieties: What 20,000 letters to an advice columnist tell us about what\u2014and who\u2014concerns us most, published in November 2018.\n> \n> The dataset includes information such as the URL and title of the articles or publications where the questions were published. It also contains the text of the questions asked by readers. These questions were publicly available on websites as well as obtained from digital copies of newspapers that included Dear Abby sections.\n> \n> It is important to note that this dataset does not include any updates.\n> \n> The writers of these questions are predominantly female (approximately two-thirds) based on demographics mentioned by Pauline Phillips, which were collected through a survey she conducted in 1987. However, there is limited information available about their origins or other demographic data. Additionally, it should be acknowledged that only a fraction of all written-in questions were published because advice columnists selectively choose which ones to feature.\n> \n> Despite these limitations, this dataset offers a glimpse into important societal concerns over time. For instance, it reflects issues like the HIV/AIDS crisis during the 1980s. With over 20,000 questions spanning several decades, it provides a directional understanding of broader trends.\n> \n> The essay based on this dataset highlighted three main themes: sex, LGBTQ issues, and religion. To analyze these topics further, relevant keywords were used for each issue to create broad groupings and then narrow down into specific categories.\n> \n> In addition to these themes, questions related to parents, children friends and bosses were also explored using a visual clustering technique called t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding). Manual categorization was also employed by tagging relevant entries within those groupings.\n> \n> It's important to note that the dataset does not include any information about the dates of publication or data collection.\n> \n> Overall, this dataset provides a comprehensive view of American anxieties and concerns over several decades, offering insights into cultural shifts and societal issues\n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> \n> - **Understanding the Columns**: The dataset consists of several columns that provide valuable information about each question. \n> \n>    - `question_only`: This column contains the text of the question asked by the reader.\n>    - `title`: This column contains the title or headline of the article or publication where the question was published.\n>    - `url`: This column contains the URL of the article or publication where the question was published.\n> \n> - **Analyzing Specific Topics**: The dataset covers various topics that were concerning Americans during this time period. You can use specific keywords related to these topics in combination with text analysis techniques to gain insights into public concerns and attitudes.\n> \n>    Common themes covered in this dataset include sex, LGBTQ issues, religion, parents, children, friends, and bosses.\n> \n> - **Keyword Analysis**: To analyze specific topics or themes within this dataset effectively, it is recommended to create a list of relevant keywords related to your research interests. These keywords can be used for filtering and searching within columns like `question_only` or `title`.\n> \n> - **Text Analysis Techniques**: You can apply various text analysis techniques on this dataset such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling (using methods like Latent Dirichlet Allocation), word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis etc., based on your research goals.\n> \n> - **Visualizations and Clustering**: If you are interested in exploring patterns or trends in relationship between different variables present in each question (such as topic clustering), you can utilize visualization techniques like t-SNE to create visual representations.\n> \n>    You can also apply other clustering algorithms or network analysis techniques to gain additional insights from the dataset.\n> \n> Remember to acknowledge the source when using this dataset: [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool) essay [30 Years of American Anxieties: What 20,000 letters to an advice columnist tell us about what\u2014and who\u2014concerns us most.](https://pudding.cool/2018/11/dearabby/) published in November 2018.\n> \n> Please note that this dataset is static and will not be updated in the future\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Analyzing Trends in American Anxieties: This dataset can be used to analyze and understand the changing concerns and anxieties of Americans over the span of three decades. By examining the keywords and topics of the questions asked, researchers can identify patterns and trends in societal worries.\n> - Gender Analysis: Since it is mentioned that two-thirds of the writers are likely female, this dataset can be used to explore gender-related concerns and differences. Researchers can analyze how gender affects the types of questions asked, as well as examine any changes or continuities in gender-related anxieties over time.\n> - Cultural Analysis: By examining the keywords related to sex, LGBTQ issues, religion, parents, children, friends, and bosses mentioned in the dataset, researchers can gain insights into American cultural values and norms during different time periods. This information can be useful for studying social attitudes towards these topics and exploring how they may have evolved over time\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/kgarrett)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: raw_da_qs.csv**\n| Column name       | Description                                                                    |\n|:------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **year**          | The year of publication of the question.
