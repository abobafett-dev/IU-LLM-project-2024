The data includes Values for Products and ServicesCode, Meaning of Products and Services code, Year, as well as Product Shipments Value in thousands of dollars. This comprehensive dataset allows you to gain valuable insight into the performance of US Detailed Manufacturing Industries during this two-year period and can help inform decisions about future manufacturing strategies. With easy access to a bird's eye view of different product categories over multiple years, make sure to take advantage of this comprehensive dataset today!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset provides sales data for US Detailed Manufacturing Industries in 2014 and 2015. This dataset can be used to analyze trends within the US manufacturing industry across different sectors from 2014-2015. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a guide on how to use this dataset: \n&gt; - First, take a look at the columns provided in the dataset. The columns include Products and services code, Meaning of Products and services code, Year, and Products shipments value ($1,000). All of these values are important in helping you understand the sales patterns of US Detailed Manufacturing Industries across different sectors from 2014-2015. \n&gt; - Use the unique products and services codes to identify each sector within manufacturing industries covered by this study dataset (e.g., bituminous coal mining or laptop computer equipment manufacturing)  \n&gt; - Sort through the data using your specific sector code and compare sales numbers between multiple years to discover any trends that may exist throughout various manufacturing industries during that two year period (2014-2015). \n&gt; - Look at what other variables you may want to include when exploring this time period (such as employment rate for a given state/manufacturing sector), as well as what additional datasets that could help put these numbers into context (For example: gather market prices for each good or service produced by an industry compared with its sales number over time).   \n&gt; -.Analyze other regions\u2019 successes over time \u2013 often there are great similarities between regions with similar success rates - cross referencing topics such as growth rate amongst others will be helpful comparison points when determining which region had a more successful overall performance according to our results from this particular data set on manufactured goods sold between 2014 - 2015 .   -.Once completed - publish your findings on Kaggle with visualizations included so others can learn from your experience!\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyzing product trends and identifying areas of growth and decline - This dataset can be used to track the sales of US Detailed Manufacturing Industries in 2014 and 2015, allowing analysts to compare changes in sales within industries over time. \n&gt; - Looking for correlations between different products - By looking at the Meaning of Products and Services code, it may be possible to find correlations between different kinds of manufacturing products; for example, current trends that may exist across different regions or countries.\n&gt; - Determining consumer trend preferences - The Products Shipment Value ($1,000) column indicates how much money is being spent on particular types of products or services. This data can be used to determine consumer preference trends; which types of items are popular or unpopular at a given point in time?\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/garyhoov)\n&gt;  \n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; **Unknown License - Please check the dataset description for more information.**\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Sales by detailed manufacturing industries US 2014 and 2015.csv**\n| Column name                               | Description                                                                                             |\n|:------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Products and services code**            | A code that identifies the type of product or service being offered.
