Whether you're interested in learning more about customer preferences or simply exploring unbiased data analysis techniques, this data is sure to provide insight beyond what one could anticipate\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset \n&gt; - To get started with this dataset, you first need to select the columns you want to analyze. Once your columns are selected, use pivot tables to create a summary of the total amount spent by month or city or other parameters of analysis.
