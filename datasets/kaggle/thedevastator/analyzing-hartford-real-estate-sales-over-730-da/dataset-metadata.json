The columns in this dataset include LocationStartNumber, ApartmentUnitNumber, StreetNameAndWay, LandSF TotalFinishedArea, LivingUnits ,OwnerLastName OwnerFirstName ,PrimaryGrantor ,SaleDate SalePrice ,TotalAppraisedValue and LegalReference - all valuable information to anyone wishing to understand the recent market trends and developments in the City of Hartford real estate industry. With this data providing detailed insights into what properties are selling at what time frame and for how much money \u2013 let\u2019s see what secrets we can learn from examining the City of Hartford real estate activity!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset contains helpful information about homes sold in the Hartford area over the past two years. This data can be used to analyze trends in real estate markets, as well as monitor sales activity for various areas. \n&gt; \n&gt; In order to use this dataset, you will need knowledge of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) such as data cleaning and data visualization techniques. You will also need a basic understanding of SQL queries and Python scripting language. \n&gt; \n&gt; The first step is to familiarize yourself with the columns and information contained within the dataset by analyzing descriptive statistics like mean, min, max etc. Next you can filter or \u201cslice\u201d the data based on certain criteria or variables that interest you - such as sale date range, location (by street name or zip code), sale price range, type of dwelling unit etc. After using various filters for analysis it is important to take an error-check step by looking for outliers or any discrepancies that may exist - this will ensure more accuracy in results when plotting graphs and visualizing trends via software tools like Tableau and Power BI etc.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Next you can conduct exploratory analysis through plot visualizations of relationships between buyer characteristics (first & last name) vs prices over time; living units vs square footage stats; average price per bedroom/bathroom ratio comparisons etc \u2013 all while taking into account external factors such as seasonal changeovers that could affect pricing fluctuations during given intervals across multiple neighborhoods - use interactive maps if available  ets. At this point it's easy to compile insightful reports containing commonalities amongst buyers and begin generalizing your findings with extrapolations which allow us gain a better understanding of current market conditions across different demographic spectrums being compared ie traditional Vs luxury properties \u2013 all made possible simply through dedicated research with datasets like these!\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyzing market trends in the City of Hartford's real estate industry by tracking sale prices and appraised values over time to identify regions who are being under or over valued. \n&gt; - Conducting a predictive analysis project to predict future sales prices, annual appreciation rates, and key features associated with residential properties such as total finished area and living units for investment purposes.\n&gt; - Studying the impact of local zoning laws on property ownership and development by comparing sale dates, primary grantors, legal references, street names and ways in a given area over time\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/dataworldadmin)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
