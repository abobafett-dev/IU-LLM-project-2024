Through a comprehensive exploration of drug usage along with population characteristics, we can uncover deeper insights into the prevalence of antidepressant use in this demographic and its potential causes. By carefully inspecting this data set which contains details about drug use, census data and associated drug names by code, we can shed light on an important issue with far reaching implications for public health worldwide\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset offers an opportunity to analyze antidepressant use among children and adolescents in Denmark, Norway and Sweden from 2007 to 2017. To get started with your analysis, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the dataset. Below are some simple steps for getting acquainted with the available resources:\n> \n> - Familiarize yourself with the column descriptions and data types. Each column contains meaningful information about drug use and population characteristics in the three countries during this window of time. \n> - Review the drug_names file contained in this dataset for a detailed list of drugs associated with each code represented in the main table. This is particularly important because ATC (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) codes provide an easy shorthand way of referring to individual medications without being too long-winded or cluttering up columns not relevant to your particular question or hypothesis \n> - Explore correlations between different parameters using crosstabs, scatterplots, or other common visualizations as necessary  \n> - Use census data contained in census_data file as a reference when discussing population makeup  within any given country during this period  \n> \n> With this approach, you will have all that's necessary to derive meaningful results out of this dataset! Good luck on your exploration!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Comparing the sex, age and population weights of those using different types of antidepressants in each country \n> - Tracking consumption trends across countries and between genders over time \n> - Correlating antidepressant use with national income indicators such as GDP per capita or overall Mental Health Index scores\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/3366068#.Y8Oq39JBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
