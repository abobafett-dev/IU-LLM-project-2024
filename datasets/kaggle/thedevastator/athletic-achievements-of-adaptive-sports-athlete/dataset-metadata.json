We aim to promote adaptive sports programs that provide a safe and supportive environment for people with disabilities who would otherwise not get access to physical activity. \n> \n> These adaptive sports such as biking, golfing, skiing and snowboarding give participants both physical and mental benefits. We hope this dataset motivates others to join in on the diverse range of these activities! With this dataset on Adaptive Sports Athletes including marathon wheelchair results from the Boston, Chicago, London & New York Marathons; historical information from the Paralympics; UK Paralympic spending & results for UK athletes - you will be able to visualize the amazing feats accomplished by adaptive sports athletes around the world. We look forward to seeing your visualizations that display different perspectives of this valuable data!  Be sure tag all three projects on Twitter (DiversityInData/ProjectHealthViz/SportsVizSunday) and let us know if you have any questions!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset contains records of the athletic achievements of adaptive sports athletes from 2000 to 2016. It includes athlete, gender, nationality and sport information, as well as details about medals won and race times recorded. \n> \n> The data is organized in columns for easy access. The first column contains the name of the athlete. The second contains information about their year of competition (from 2000-2016). \n> The third (nationality) holds information about their country of origin. The fourth column holds the time it took them to complete the race. This is followed by total time taken in seconds, then a column for the title of race completed, after that is gender and sport name columns following thereafter are all medal-related ones: gold, silver and bronze respectivey with lastly an overview total number won and finally games they participated in completing 2019 Olympics trial races while other seasons held participative world championships in 2020 pandemic cancelations etc..\n> \n> We encourage all to explore this data according to your particular interests - whether you would like to investigate which countries produce most successful adaptation athletes or look into most performed event individual athletes partake in in this category - whatever way you use it do not forget root purpose behind generating such records: paying tribute those amazing individuals who despite physical limitations have been able achieve excellence on par with other global professional athletes! Best wishes!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Creating an interactive map visualization showing the locations of global adaptive sports events.\n> - Developing a data dashboard that compares success and funding for UK Paralympic athletes over time.\n> - Analyzing trends in the medal counts of countries with high investments in Paralympic programs to determine which ones provide the greatest return on investment\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/diversityindata)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Marathon Wheelchair Winners.csv**\n| Column name               | Description                                                                   |\n|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Athlete**               | The name of the athlete.
