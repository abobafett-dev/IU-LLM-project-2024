Here we are bringing you a complete breakdown of 60 sports and their demands for 10 distinct skills that make up athletic capabilities. We collected data from 8 expert panelists and asked them to rate each sport on a scale of 1-10 for every skill ranging from Strength and Speed to Nerve, Hand-eye Coordination, and more. By totalling up the opinions of our experts, we have created an overall degree of difficulty score for each sport in the dataset between 1-100. If you're curious as to which sports require what skill sets, or if you're wondering which is the toughest sport across all ten skillsets - this is your place! Get ready to explore how athleticism guides our understanding of what makes 'Toughest Sport'!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset contains the rankings of 60 sports across 10 skills, as well as the total score and rank of each sport. It is intended to provide an overview of the relative athleticism required across a variety of different competitive sports and can be used to identify which physical attributes are most important in each sport. \n> \n> To use this dataset, you will need to understand what the different sports measured by this data set represent. Sports like skiing, boxing, wrestling, and football all require very different mental and physical abilities in order to compete successfully. For example, Alpine Skiing will require greater skill related to speed, agility and power than Cross Country running does; while Swimming may rely more heavily on durability than Football does. Once familiar with the included sports then it becomes easier to utilize the scores assigned for each skill in order identify which skills might benefit a particular athlete most when considering a new athletic challenge. \n> \n> The dataset also provides useful information about how difficult it might be for any one individual athlete or competitor if they were looking at taking up one particular sport from scratch versus another with similar momentum when compared in terms of its overall scores across 10 areas relating specifically as they relate athletics. This could help indicate whether that athlete has a better chance or worse chance when competing against others who may have trained in or specialised within their chosen field longer or shorter than themselves respectively before stepping onto this same playing field together; simply by comparing total Athletics Skill Demand (ASD) Numbers over between both their desired sporting choices (the higher number representing higher difficulty). \n> \n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Identifying the most requested athletic traits by sport. By analyzing the data, one can uncover patterns within certain sports that require certain skills or abilities more than others.\n> - Determining which sports offer the best opportunity for balance and development of all skillsets by athletes. Specifically, this dataset could be used to identify which sports encourage holistic athletic development and what combination of skill demands those particular sports have in common.\n> - Developing an optimal training program for athletes interested in perfecting their craft in a particular sport by geotargeting regions with more advanced competition based on their specific skill needs relative to that region\u2019s average competition level as demonstrated by this dataset\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/coreyhermanson)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **Unknown License - Please check the dataset description for more information.**\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: toughestsport.csv**\n| Column name   | Description                                              |\n|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|\n| **SPORT**     | Name of the sport.
