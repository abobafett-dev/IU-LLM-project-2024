All data is gathered from reliable sources, providing accurate information about these powerful storms that have plagued the coasts since records began. This overview of past named storms gives us a better understanding of hurricane patterns over time and provides insights into what might be possible in the future. Dive into this dataset to learn more about how our environment is changing and affecting conditions for hurricane formation!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset provides data on wind speed and pressure information for Atlantic named storms since 1950. It contains start and end dates, maximum wind speed in mph, minimum pressure in millibars, and the type of storm. This data can be useful for analysis of large scale weather events throughout the Atlantic basin.  \n> \n> Using this dataset, one could do a variety of analyses to compare or better understand historical or recurring major storms or hurricanes. For example, researchers could examine the production intensity of hurricanes over time with boxes plots by season. Data analysts can also investigate if there is a trend in hurricane intensity between 1950-present by calculating yearly average maximum sustained wind speeds as well as looking at differences between El Nino years versus La Nina years through graphical representation such as scatterplots. \n> \n> In addition to hurricane research, this dataset can also be used to evaluate coastal insurance policies and risk assessment models that are reliant on storm surge heights related with pressure drops during an event. By monitoring the relative values observed from these individual storms over time it can help shoreline communities more accurately plan their future investments against potential coastal hazards like floods and stormwave heights generated from incoming cyclones making landfall along their coasts - providing them enough advance warning should they ever face a similar situation again potentially saving lives from mass evacuations being orchestrated due to inaccurate declarations which would later prove fruitless after extensive damage assessments had been conducted afterwards bypassing most ideal solutions involving forecast priority solutions that were put forth prior to any initial forecasts being made concerning a given events severity so that no miscommunication has led to insufficient resources & services being dispatched out just before those devastating waves come crashing down yet again renewing long membered disasters & tragedies we\u2019re all trying hard work towards mitigating each passing day.. \n>  \n> In conclusion this Atlantic Namedstorm Maximum Wind Speed Dataset has many possibilities when it comes towards discovery through means like these exemplified previously! But hopefully now you have an understanding how powerful this data set may become with just your vision alone !\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Analysing the correlation between wind speeds and the pressure of storms in different years or months to identify seasonal trends and predict future storm severity.\n> - Comparing how different types of storms from 1950-present have changed in strength over time by measuring their average wind speed over time to see what factors have had a significant impact on the speed at which they travel. \n> - Creating an interactive visualization tool that can compare area-specific data for average wind speeds of storms across multiple years, allowing homeowners and other stakeholders to easily observe changes with regards to damage due to high winds at a local level for various points in history\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/asimmonz)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **Unknown License - Please check the dataset description for more information.**\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Named Storm Data - since 1950.csv**\n| Column name              | Description                                                        |\n|:-------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Year**                 | The year the storm occurred.
