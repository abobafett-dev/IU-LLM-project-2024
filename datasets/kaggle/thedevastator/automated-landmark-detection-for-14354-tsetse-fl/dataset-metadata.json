Accurately located with automatic deep learning by a two-tier method, this identification process is essential for those conducting morphological or biological research on the species *Glossina pallidipes* and *G. m. morsitans*. An accurate capture of these data points is both difficult and time-consuming \u2014 making our employee double tier method an invaluable resource for any researchers in need! Columns include morphology data such as wing length measurements, landmark locations, host collections, collection dates/months/years, morphometric data strings and more \u2014 allowing you to uncover new insights into these fascinating insects through detailed analysis! Unlock new discoveries within the natural world by exploring this exciting dataset today \u2014 from gaining insight into tsetse fly wing characteristics to larger implications regarding biology and evolution\u2014 you never know what exciting findings await!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> **Step 1:** Download the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jthileeban/automated-landmark-detection-for-14354).

These two pieces of information are extremely helpful when analyzing wingpair morphology within a larger sample size as they allow researchers to identify discrepancies between multiple sets of wings in a given group quickly and easily.  \n>     \t \t    \t \t         \t   \t      \t  \t     \n>  **Step 3: ** Take note of each wing's landmark coordinates, which can be found under columns lmkl through lmkr \u2014 there are 11 total areas measured per each individual left and right wing (e.g., \u2018L x1\u2019: X coordinate of first landmark on the left wing provides anatomical precision)   \n> \n>  **Step 4: ** Make sure that both wings have been labeled accurately by checking out their respective quality grades found under columns 'left_good' and 'right_good'. A grade of either 0 or 1 indicates whether background noise is present, which could result in inaccurate set of landmark points later on during analysis; thus grade should always be 1 before continuing with further steps\n> \n>  ** Step 5 :** Calculate pertinent averages from given values such as overall wing span measurement or anatomic landmarks distances \u2013 these averages shall tell us if there exist particular traits distinguishing among multiple groups gathered together for comparison purposes\n> \n>  Lastly \u2013 always double check accuracy!
