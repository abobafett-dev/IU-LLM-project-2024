It contains 13 indicators such as low birth weight, prenatal visits, teen births, and more. This data is sourced from the Maryland Department of Health & Mental Hygiene (DHMH), Baltimore Substance Abuse Systems (BSAS), theBaltimore City Health Department, and the US Census Bureau. Through this data set we can gain a better understanding of how Baltimore City citizens\u2019 health compares to other areas and how it has changed over time. By investigating this dataset we are given an opportunity to create potential strategies for providing better care for our community. With discoveries from these indicators, together as a city we can bring about lasting change in protecting public health within Baltimore\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset provides valuable information about the health and wellbeing of children and families in Baltimore City in 2010. The data is organized by CSA (Census Statistical Area) and includes stats on term births, low birth weight births, prenatal visits, teen births, and lead testing. This dataset can be used to analyze trends in children's health over time as well as identify potential areas that need more attention or resources. \n>  \n> To use this dataset: \n> - Read through the data dictionary to understand what each column represents.  \n> - Choose which columns you would like to explore further.   \n> - Filter or subset the data as you see fit then visualize it with graphs or maps to better understand how conditions vary across neighborhoods in Baltimore City.  \n> - Consider comparing the data from this year with prior years if available for deeper analysis of changes over time.  \n> - Look for correlations among columns that could help explain disparities between neighborhoods and create strategies for improving outcomes through policy interventions or other programs designed specifically for those areas needs\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Mapping health disparities in high-risk areas to target public health interventions.\n> - Identifying neighborhoods in need of additional resources for prenatal care, infant care, and lead testing and create specific programs to address these needs.\n> - Creating an online dashboard that displays real time data on Baltimore City\u2019s population health indicators such as birth weight, teenage pregnancies, and lead poisoning for the public to access easily\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/baltimore)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
