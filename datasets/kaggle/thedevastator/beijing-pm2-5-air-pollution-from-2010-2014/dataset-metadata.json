The data, collected and organized by Song Xi Chen at the Guanghua School of Management, Center for Statistical Science of Peking University, records a variety of measurements including PM2.5 concentration (a marker for fine particles not visible to the naked eye), temperature (in Celsius), pressure (in millibars), dew point (in Celsius), combined wind direction, accumulated snow hours and accumulated rain hours. This comprehensive dataset provides an in-depth exploration into the severity of Beijing\u2019s PM2.5 pollution - from its effect on regional weather patterns to its contribution to harmful particulates in the atmosphere such as Black Carbon. With this information on fine particles and air quality conditions at their disposal, researchers can gain invaluable insight into improving urban environments and mitigating health risks associated with elevated levels of fine particles in our cities\u2019 air quality today\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Creating an interactive map that shows the changes of PM2.5 concentration over a period of time.\n&gt; - Developing a machine learning model to predict future PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing based on current weather data and previous data points in the dataset. \n&gt; - Training a deep neural network to detect potential correlations between wind direction, dew point, precipitation and air pressure with changes in air quality over time\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/uci)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: PRSA_data_2010.1.1-2014.12.31.csv**\n| Column name   | Description                                                                        |\n|:--------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **No**        | Row number (Integer).                                                              |\n| **year**      | Year of data in this row (Integer).                                                |\n| **month**     | Month of data in this row (Integer).                                               |\n| **day**       | Day of data in this row (Integer).                                                 |\n| **hour**      | Hour of data in this row (Integer).                                                |\n| **pm2.5**     | PM2.5 concentration (ug/m3) (Float).                                               |\n| **DEWP**      | Dew Point (\u00e2\u201e\u0192) (Float).                                                           |\n| **TEMP**      | Temperature (\u00e2\u201e\u0192) (Float).                                                         |\n| **PRES**      | Pressure (hPa) (Float).                                                            |\n| **cbwd**      | Combined wind direction (String, limited to 3 categories NNE, NE, ENE, ESE, SE...) |\n| **Iws**       | Cumulated wind speed (m/s) (Float).                                                |\n| **Is**        | Cumulated hours of snow (Float).                                                   |\n| **Ir**        | Cumulated hours of rain (Float)                                                    |\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit [UCI](https://data.world/uci).\n\n",
