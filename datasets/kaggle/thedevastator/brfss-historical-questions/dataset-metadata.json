These health-related questions span a range of topics, from lifestyle choices to disease symptoms, and are organized into distinct categories such as general health, mental health, nutrition & physical activity, tobacco use, sexual behavior & HIV/AIDS knowledge. Responses are recorded based on each individual's answers. With this data set at your fingertips you can analyze how various risk factors may have changed over time and reflect upon how lifestyle choices have the potential to alter an individual\u2019s quality of life. Take a deep dive into this meaningful dataset to gain newfound insights!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset provides valuable insight into the modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases and other leading causes of death by surveying responses to questions from 1984-2014. To use this dataset, it is important to understand what each column represents. The Question column contains the questions asked in the survey, while the Responses column indicates the various possible answers to those questions. The VariableName column shows how each question was associated with a corresponding variable, and the Type tells you what type of question was asked (e.g.: multiple choice). Finally, you can use the year and topic columns respectively to track when a given a question was asked and what it related to. \n> \n> Using this dataset, one could determine any trends that occurred over time regarding attitudes or behaviors associated with different topics as they were addressed in surveys throughout 1984-2014. Additionally, users can compare particular variables across different years or topics that may relevant to their research interests. This dataset is most appropriate for qualitative analyses rather than numerical ones; however, further analysis would still provide valuable insight into behavior change over time within certain populations or communities based on responses from previous survey respondents throughout these 30 years!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Using the data to create targeted public health campaigns and educational materials about risk factors for chronic diseases that are most prominent in each geographic area. \n> - Analyzing trends in responses over time to better understand the impact of awareness campaigns, lifestyle changes, and other interventions on the prevalence of modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases. \n> - Conducting a detailed comparison of areas with similar demographic or economic characteristics to track how attitudes and behavior towards modifiable risk factors vary by region and identify which interventions are effective at encouraging positive behavior change\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/health)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
