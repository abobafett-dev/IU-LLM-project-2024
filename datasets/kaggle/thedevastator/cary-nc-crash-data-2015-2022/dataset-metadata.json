Each incident is mapped based on National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) criteria, providing greater accuracy and access to all available crashes in the County.\n&gt; \n&gt; This valuable resource is constantly being updated \u2013 every day fresh data is added and older records are subject to change. The locations featured in this dataset reflect approximate points of intersection or impact. In cases when essential detail elements are missing or rendered unmapable, certain crash incidents may not appear on maps within this source. \n&gt; \n&gt; We invite you to explore how crashes have influenced the Town of Cary over the past five years \u2013 from changes in weather conditions and traffic controls to vehicular types, contributing factors, travel zones and more! Whether it's analyzing road design elements or assessing fatality rates \u2013 come take a deeper look at what has shaped modern day policies for safe driving today!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; \n&gt; - Understanding Data Elements \u2013 The first step in using this dataset is understanding what information is included in it. The data elements include location descriptions, road features, character traits of roads and more that are associated with each crash. Additionally, the data provides details about contributing factors, light conditions, weather conditions and more that can be used to understand why certain crashes happen in certain locations or under certain circumstances. \n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyzing trends in crash locations to better understand where crashes are more likely to occur. For example, using machine learning techniques and geographical mapping tools to identify patterns in the data that could enable prediction of future hotspots of crashes. \n&gt; - Investigating the correlations between roadway characteristics (e.g., surface, configuration and class) and accident severities in order to recommend improvements or additional preventative measures at certain intersections or road segments which may help reduce crash-related fatalities/injuries. \n&gt; - Using data from various contributing factors (e.g., traffic control, weather conditions, work area) as an input for a predictive model for analyzing the risk factors associated with different types of crashes such as head-on collisions, rear-end collisions or side swipe accidents so that safety alerts can be issued for public awareness campaigns during specific times/days/conditions where such incidents have been known to occur more often or have increased severity repercussions than usual (i.e., near schools during school days)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/townofcary)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [Open Database License (ODbL) v1.0](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/)**\n&gt; - You are free to:\n&gt;      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format.\n&gt;      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt; - You must:\n&gt;      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n&gt;      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n&gt;      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n&gt;      - **No Derivatives** - If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you may not distribute the modified material.\n&gt;      - **No additional restrictions** - You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: crash-data-3.csv**\n| Column name   | Description                                                                                          |\n|:--------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **type**      | The type of crash, such as single-vehicle, multi-vehicle, or pedestrian.
