This survey provides valuable insights and analysis on maternal health, mindset, and experiences pre-pregnancy through postpartum phase. Statistically representative data is gathered from mothers all over the United States concerning issues such as abuse, alcohol use, contraception, breastfeeding, mental health, obesity and many more. \n&gt; \n&gt; This survey provides an invaluable source of information which is key in targeting areas that need improvement when it comes to maternal wellbeing. Armed with PRAMS data state health officials are able to work towards promoting a healthy environment for mothers and their babies during this important period of life. Rich in data points ranging from smoking exposure to infant sleep behavior trends can be identified across states as well as nationally with this unique system supported by CDC's partnership with state health departments. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here you will find a-mazing datasets containing columns such like Year or LocationAbbr or Response allowing you analyze some really meaningful stuff like: Are women in certain parts of the US more likely compared to others to breastfeed? What about rates at which pregnant mothers take prenatal care?

Here are some tips for understanding how to maximize this dataset:\n&gt; - Look through each column carefully \u2013 take note of which columns contain numerical information (Data_Value_Unit), categorical responses (Response) or location descriptions (Location Desc). \n&gt; - Make sure that you are aware of any standard errors that may be associated with data values (Data_Value_Std_Err). \n&gt; - It\u2019s useful to know the source(DataSource)of your data so if possible check out who has collected it.  \n&gt; - Check what classifications have been used in BreakOut columns \u2013 this can give additional insight into how subjects were divided up within datasets.  \n&gt; - Understand how pregnancies were grouped together geographically by taking a look at LocationAbbr and Geolocation columns - understanding where surveys have been done can help break down regional differences in responses.  \n&gt; With these steps will help you navigate through your dataset so that you can accurately interpret questions posed by pregnant women from different locations across the U.S.\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Using this dataset, public health officials could analyze maternal attitudes and experiences over a period of time to develop targeted strategies to improve maternal health. \n&gt; - This dataset can be used to create predictive models of maternal behavior based on the amount of prenatal care received and other factors such as alcohol use, sleep behavior and tobacco use. \n&gt; - Analyzing this dataset would also allow researchers to identify trends in infant wellbeing outcomes across various states/municipalities with different policies/interventions in place which can then be replicated in other areas with similar characteristics\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/health)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [Open Database License (ODbL) v1.0](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/)**\n&gt; - You are free to:\n&gt;      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format.\n&gt;      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt; - You must:\n&gt;      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n&gt;      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n&gt;      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n&gt;      - **No Derivatives** - If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you may not distribute the modified material.\n&gt;      - **No additional restrictions** - You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: rows.csv**\n| Column name                    | Description                                              |\n|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Year**                       | Year of the survey.
