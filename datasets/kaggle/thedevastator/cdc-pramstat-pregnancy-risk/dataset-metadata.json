It provides state-specific population-based data related to the attitudes and experiences of women before, during, and after pregnancy. This dataset was gathered in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) project which works to improve the health of mothers and infants by collecting data on issues such as abuse, alcohol use, contraception, breastfeeding, mental health, obesity, prenatal-care sleep behavior smoke exposure stress tens use WIC Medicaid infant health and unintended pregnancy.  Additionally this dataset includes information regarding data value unit type footnote symbol standard error sample size break out category and geolocation of participating surveyors. With this granular level of detail researchers can understand a wide array of insights about current maternal healthcare trends providing key takeaways into what areas should be further studied or improved upon in order to better support mothers around the country\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> \n> This dataset has multiple entries for different locations across all years from 2007 onwards, so it\u2019s important to note that the information you see may not necessarily apply to the year or location you are researching! Each entry contains information about its location (location abbreviation, description), question type (class & topic), source of data (datasource) as well as response data value type and footnote symbol. More specific details such as sample size, break out classification and standard error values are also available in each entry so you can get an idea of the accuracy of each response. \n> \n> To make sense of this vast amount of information in a logical way it is best to start off by defining what questions or analyses you want to perform with this data set. Once you have your objectives set it is easy to narrow down what columns are relevant based on those needs: select only those columns containing attributes critical in achieving your analysis purpose while leaving out any redundant attributes that do not support your current goal.
