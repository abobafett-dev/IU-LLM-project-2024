It includes different components such as pretraining, finetuning and reward data which allows the model to learn how to produce more accurate answers in the medical context. The dataset consists of columns containing questions, chosen responses and rejected responses allowing it to view multiple perspectives when constructing a conversation. This makes the model not only more precise but also reinforces its ability to engage with medical dialogue at an advanced level, making it great resource for businesses, researchers or any individual looking into developing their own intelligent healthcare system\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset can be used to train an intelligent language model for medical dialogue in Chinese. To use this dataset, one would need to get familiar with the following steps:\n&gt; \n&gt; - **Pretraining** - Use the pretraining data provided in the dataset to build and fine-tune a language model. This will help the model understand basic elements of the medical dialogue and acquire general knowledge about Chinese medicine. \n&gt;  \n&gt; - **Finetuning** - Use the finetune data and apply transfer learning techniques such as distrust learning or multi-task learning to further improve model accuracy on specific tasks such as medical related questions and responses. \n&gt;    \n&gt; - **Reward** - Make use of rewards from patient or doctor for correct responses, which will help boost performance of AI systems by guiding them with real feedback from experienced healthcare professionals or patients themselves based on their understanding of medicine knowledge in long dialogue flows        interviews or discussions  .  \n&gt; - **Evaluation** - After training with pretraining/finetuning/reward datasets, make sure you evaluate your trained models on unseen data using reward_validation file which is provided along with the dataset itself to assess its performance level effectively\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Utilizing reinforcement learning with the reward data for training a dialogue model that rewards correct responses.\n&gt; - Employing few-shot learning methods to quickly adapt the pretraining data for new and unseen medical dialogues.\n&gt; - Exploring transfer learning techniques to apply knowledge learned from one medical domain to another\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shibing624/medical)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
