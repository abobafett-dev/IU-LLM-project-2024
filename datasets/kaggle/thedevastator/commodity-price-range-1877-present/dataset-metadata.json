It provides a glimpse into the evolution of our modern economic markets and the constant fluctuations in demand and supply that occur at all times. This data is invaluable to academic researchers, corporate strategists, economists, investors and traders alike as it reveals timely insight into various commodities' pricing trends over time. Each record includes the corresponding highest and lowest prices for each particular well-traded commodity on each particular day since 1877\u2014 providing an essential view into market dynamics across multiple decades. Use this data to identify recent pricing patterns or make predictions about future prices \u2013 no matter how you decide to use it\u2013this may give you further insight into the ever-changing marketplace\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset contains historical commodity price ranges for wheat, corn, and oats futures contracts from 1877 to present. It is a great resource for anyone interested in analyzing the trends of these commodities over time. Each row contains one day's data on the low and high prices of each contract. \n> \n> To use this dataset, start by looking at the columns. There are several columns to choose from depending on which type of commodity you would like to analyze: Range_W_F1 (Lowest Price of Wheat Futures Contract), Range_W_F2 (Highest Price of Wheat Futures Contract), Range_C_F1 (Lowest Price of Corn Futures Contract), Range_C_F2 (Highest Price of Corn Futures Contract) and Range_O_F1 & 2 (Lowest and Highest Prices respectively for Oats Futures Contracts). Once you have selected the relevant columns for your analysis, pick a date range to focus on and filter out the rows outside that range. This will leave only those days within your chosen timeframe in the dataset so you can begin analyzing them more closely. \n> \n> For an in-depth analysis it can be helpful to add other pieces data such as weather information or other economic indicators alongside these price ranges so you can investigate possible correlations between different factors that affect pricing in these markets over time. No matter how complex an analysis you might want to do with this data, this dataset provides a good starting point with reliable historical records dating all the way back over 140 years ago!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Market analysis to identify trends in prices of different commodities over time.\n> - Predictive modeling to forecast future prices based on past price ranges and market conditions.\n> - Proactive risk management strategies by tracking changes in commodity prices and anticipating potential changes in raw material costs for manufacturers or businesses that rely on commodities as part of their production processes\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/4683724#.Y9Y72dJBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
