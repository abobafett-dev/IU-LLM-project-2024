This dataset analyses all movies that were listed on Filmaffinity at a given moment in time, as well as their corresponding IMDb ratings. It provides information about a wide range of data points including titles, original titles, release year, duration, country of origin, directors and writers , cast members , production companies and genres. In addition to this fascinating information about the movies themselves it also includes detailed coverage on reviews encompassing awards won for each movie  achieved ratings from both sources; FilmAffinity's voted ratings along with their positive , negative and neutral votes; plus IMDb's own reviewer marks which can be compared against one another when examining predictive factors. This dataset enables researchers to make insightful visualisations over influential criteria that can successfully predict film rating results contiguously showing acceptance thresholds over time or by specific geographic region\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset is a valuable resource for researchers who are interested in exploring the accuracy of FilmAffinity and IMDb's ratings, as well as the discrepancies between them.
