The indicators explore service organization and delivery of treatment capacity against preventative programs in Nigeria according to sex levels across respective income groups. \n&gt; \n&gt; Questions related to financial protection or youth utilization are also addressed in this dataset. Additional epidemiological aspects of the data include observations on neglected tropical diseases as well as drug resistance to insecticides. Additionally included is information on medical equipment accessibility; utilizing ICD codes alongside sexual reproductive heath status variables which offer insight into UHC (Universal Health Coverage). \n&gt; \n&gt; Overall this collection paints an all-encompassing picture that helps decipher patterns influencing population wellbeing regarding the current state of healthcare services in Nigeria along with any necessary decisions that may need to be taken\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset provides comprehensive indicators regarding the health levels of Nigeria. It contains data from World Health Organization (WHO) covering a variety of subjects such as Mortality, Sustainable Development Goals, Public Health and Environmental issues, Child Health, Infectious Disease, Non-Communicable Diseases and Mental Health. \n&gt; \n&gt; The dataset includes information such as the GHO code and display name for each indicator as well as region codes for Nigeria\u2019s state regions. Additionally the year that data was collected is also listed along with item specific information like wealth quintiles or sex type. Research objectives can be reached quickly by leveraging these types of indicators to tell an overall story about health conditions in Nigeria over time. \n&gt; \n&gt; To get started with this dataset you can begin by exploring the columns available at first glance two columns provide already a great insight on health condition in Nigeria: Education Level Code and Wealth Quintile Code which means one can explore how equitable access to education is based on different areas of country or are there any direct connection between affluence level which is indicated by Wealth Quintile Code column itself and other health related matters like increased mortality rate? \n&gt;  \n&gt; To explore this idea further we could look at mortality rates in detail using GHO code values found within our dataset - particularly if we are interested in certain diseases associated with mortality rates we could use our query engine to filter out relevant indicators from all that have been included here - filtering down core details associated with each indicator e.g mortality rate . We could then drill down into more detailed information using additional filters like year range , sex type , region etc   thus preceding to make more meaningful comparisons about conditions over time but also observe situations qualitatively following trends / deviations where applicable .   \n&gt; \n&gt; Finally when delving into deeper analysis it might be important stop evaluate metrics objectively based off real world parameters here - viewing raw numbers may not always give us clear understanding so its important at times to view sample size being used particularly when working with less or highly dispersed demographics not even mentioned here e.g remote villages should also be evaluated here too since it would require extra effort/resources/time triangulate similar type findings present within this set itself \n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Creating visualizations to compare health indicators over time for different regions in Nigeria, such as crude mortality rates, journey-related deaths and suicide rate.\n&gt; - Analyzing the distribution and trends of different diseases across Nigerian regions, such as cases of tuberculosis in an effort to better target areas at risk in the nation.\n&gt; - Studying the income and education level correlations with specific disease prevalence, to gain deeper insights into health disparities within Nigeria\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/humdata)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: world-health-statistics-indicators-for-nigeria-12.csv**\n| Column name                        | Description                                                               |\n|:-----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **GHO (CODE)**                     | A code that identifies the Global Health Observatory (GHO) data.

The indicators explore service organization and delivery of treatment capacity against preventative programs in Nigeria according to sex levels across respective income groups. \n&gt; \n&gt; Questions related to financial protection or youth utilization are also addressed in this dataset. Additional epidemiological aspects of the data include observations on neglected tropical diseases as well as drug resistance to insecticides. Additionally included is information on medical equipment accessibility; utilizing ICD codes alongside sexual reproductive heath status variables which offer insight into UHC (Universal Health Coverage). \n&gt; \n&gt; Overall this collection paints an all-encompassing picture that helps decipher patterns influencing population wellbeing regarding the current state of healthcare services in Nigeria along with any necessary decisions that may need to be taken\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset provides comprehensive indicators regarding the health levels of Nigeria. It contains data from World Health Organization (WHO) covering a variety of subjects such as Mortality, Sustainable Development Goals, Public Health and Environmental issues, Child Health, Infectious Disease, Non-Communicable Diseases and Mental Health. \n&gt; \n&gt; The dataset includes information such as the GHO code and display name for each indicator as well as region codes for Nigeria\u2019s state regions. Additionally the year that data was collected is also listed along with item specific information like wealth quintiles or sex type. Research objectives can be reached quickly by leveraging these types of indicators to tell an overall story about health conditions in Nigeria over time. \n&gt; \n&gt; To get started with this dataset you can begin by exploring the columns available at first glance two columns provide already a great insight on health condition in Nigeria: Education Level Code and Wealth Quintile Code which means one can explore how equitable access to education is based on different areas of country or are there any direct connection between affluence level which is indicated by Wealth Quintile Code column itself and other health related matters like increased mortality rate? \n&gt;  \n&gt; To explore this idea further we could look at mortality rates in detail using GHO code values found within our dataset - particularly if we are interested in certain diseases associated with mortality rates we could use our query engine to filter out relevant indicators from all that have been included here - filtering down core details associated with each indicator e.g mortality rate . We could then drill down into more detailed information using additional filters like year range , sex type , region etc   thus preceding to make more meaningful comparisons about conditions over time but also observe situations qualitatively following trends / deviations where applicable .   \n&gt; \n&gt; Finally when delving into deeper analysis it might be important stop evaluate metrics objectively based off real world parameters here - viewing raw numbers may not always give us clear understanding so its important at times to view sample size being used particularly when working with less or highly dispersed demographics not even mentioned here e.g remote villages should also be evaluated here too since it would require extra effort/resources/time triangulate similar type findings present within this set itself \n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Creating visualizations to compare health indicators over time for different regions in Nigeria, such as crude mortality rates, journey-related deaths and suicide rate.\n&gt; - Analyzing the distribution and trends of different diseases across Nigerian regions, such as cases of tuberculosis in an effort to better target areas at risk in the nation.\n&gt; - Studying the income and education level correlations with specific disease prevalence, to gain deeper insights into health disparities within Nigeria\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/humdata)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: world-health-statistics-indicators-for-nigeria-12.csv**\n| Column name                        | Description                                                               |\n|:-----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **GHO (CODE)**                     | A code that identifies the Global Health Observatory (GHO) data.
