This dataset is designed to provide valuable insights into the determinants of various healthcare issues in Thailand by providing detailed metrics related to the state of the country's healthcare infrastructure. It includes indicators on topics ranging from financing & policy strategies to treatment capacity & coverage; human resources; information systems; youth; financial protection & AMR Glass; sexual & reproductive health; immunization services; neglect tropical diseases (NTDs); essential technologies & medical equipment as well as demographic & socioeconomic statistics. With access to an extensive range of data points covering multiple categories this collection allows users explore further trends or develop custom analysis tailored towards their particular research needs\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset provides comprehensive health indicators related to mortality, global health estimates, sustainable development goals, and much more. With it, you can analyze the health status of Thailand over time and help inform decision makers on important healthcare policy matters. \n&gt; \n&gt; To get started using this dataset: \n&gt; - Familiarize yourself with the columns in the dataset by reading through their descriptions in the \u2018About this Dataset\u2019 section above. \n&gt; - Review any caveats or specific methodology associated with individual indicators in their respective resource descriptions where available. \n&gt; - Select which columns or areas that you want to further study or compare (e.,g., compare different regions).  \t   \t   \t   4. Filter data points based on your criteria (e.,g., filter by end year).  \t   \t   \t   5. Use the information presented in your analysis to help inform decision makers on important healthcare policy matters for Thailand!\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Creating an interactive visualization of the health indicators in Thailand to capture the trend over time or analyze correlations between different indicators. \n&gt; - Developing a mobile app to help users access essential health indicator data for Thailand in real-time, such as rate of child deaths or number of tuberculosis cases per region.\n&gt; - Creating predictive models based on these health indicators to track disease spread, forecast scarcity of certain medical resources and detect trends emerging among specific populations such as youths or males over females\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/humdata)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: rsud-governance-policy-and-financing-prevention-indicators-for-thailand-19.csv**\n| Column name                 | Description                                                            |\n|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **GHO (CODE)**              | The Global Health Observatory code for the indicator.
