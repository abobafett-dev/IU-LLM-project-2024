Aggregated from Public Health England data, this dataset provides unprecedented insight into how quickly the virus has been able to spread in local communities throughout England. Despite testing limitations, understanding these localized patterns of infection can help inform important public health decisions by local authorities and healthcare workers alike. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is essential to bear in mind that this data is likely an underestimation of true infection rates due to limited testing -- it is critical not to underestimate the risk the virus poses on a local scale!
