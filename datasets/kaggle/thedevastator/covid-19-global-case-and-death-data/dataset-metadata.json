This dataset includes data from various sources such as JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data and The New York Times.\n&gt; \n&gt; The dataset consists of several columns providing detailed information on different aspects of the COVID-19 situation. The **COUNTRY_SHORT_NAME** column represents the short name of the country where the data is recorded, while the **Data_Source** column indicates the source from which the data was obtained. \n&gt; \n&gt; Other important columns include **Cases**, which denotes the number of COVID-19 cases reported, and **Difference**, which indicates the difference in case numbers compared to the previous day. Additionally, there are columns such as CONTINENT_NAME, DATA_SOURCE_NAME, COUNTRY_ALPHA_3_CODE, COUNTRY_ALPHA_2_CODE that provide additional details about countries and continents.\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, this dataset also includes information on deaths related to COVID-19. The column **PEOPLE_DEATH_NEW_COUNT** shows the number of new deaths reported on a specific date.\n&gt; \n&gt; To provide more context to the data, certain columns offer demographic details about locations. For instance, **Population_Count** provides population counts for different areas. Moreover,**FIPS** code is available for provincial/state regions for identification purposes.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is important to note that this dataset covers both confirmed cases (**Case_Type: confirmed**) as well as probable cases (**Case_Type: probable**). These classifications help differentiate between various types of COVID-19 infections.\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, this dataset offers a comprehensive picture of global COVID-19 situations by providing accurate and up-to-date information on cases, deaths, demographic details like population count or FIPS code), source references (such as JHU CSSE or NY Times), geographical information (country names coded with ALPHA codes) , etcetera making it useful for researchers studying patterns and trends associated with this pandemic\n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; - Understanding the Dataset Structure:\n&gt;    - The dataset is available in two files: COVID-19 Activity.csv and COVID-19 Cases.csv.\n&gt;    - Both files contain different columns that provide information about the COVID-19 cases and deaths.\n&gt;    - Some important columns to look out for are: \n&gt;      a. PEOPLE_POSITIVE_CASES_COUNT: The total number of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases.\n&gt;      b. COUNTY_NAME: The name of the county where the data is recorded.\n&gt;      c. PROVINCE_STATE_NAME: The name of the province or state where the data is recorded.\n&gt;      d. REPORT_DATE: The date when the data was reported.\n&gt;      e. CONTINENT_NAME: The name of the continent where the data is recorded.\n&gt;      f. DATA_SOURCE_NAME: The name of the data source.\n&gt;      g. PEOPLE_DEATH_NEW_COUNT: The number of new deaths reported on a specific date.\n&gt;      h.COUNTRY_ALPHA_3_CODE :The three-letter alpha code  represents country\n&gt;         f.Lat,Long :latitude and longitude coordinates  represent location\n&gt;          i.Country_Region or COUNTRY_SHORT_NAME:The country or region where cases were reported.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Choosing Relevant Columns:\n&gt; It's important to determine which columns are relevant to your analysis or research question before proceeding with further analysis.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Exploring Data Patterns:\n&gt; Use various statistical techniques like summarizing statistics, creating visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line graphs), etc., to explore patterns in different variables over time or across regions/countries.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Filtering Data:\n&gt; You can filter your dataset based on specific criteria using column(s) such as COUNTRY_SHORT_NAME, CONTINENT_NAME, or PROVINCE_STATE_NAME to focus on specific countries, continents, or regions of interest.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Combining Data:\n&gt; You can combine data from different sources (e.g., COVID-19 cases and deaths) to perform advanced analysis or create insightful visualizations.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Analyzing Trends:\n&gt; Use the dataset to analyze and identify trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths over time. You can examine factors such as population count, testing count, hospitalization count, etc., to gain deeper insights into the impact of the virus.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Comparing Countries/Regions:\n&gt; Compare COVID-19\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Trend Analysis: This dataset can be used to analyze and track the trends of COVID-19 cases and deaths over time. It provides comprehensive global data, allowing researchers and policymakers to identify hotspots, monitor the progress of the virus, and make informed decisions.\n&gt; - Comparative Analysis: The dataset contains data from multiple countries and regions, making it suitable for comparative analysis. Researchers can compare the number of cases and deaths between different countries or continents, identify differences in response measures, and study factors that contribute to variations in COVID-19 outcomes.\n&gt; - Impact Assessment: By combining this dataset with additional information on population count and healthcare infrastructure, users can assess the impact of COVID-19 on different regions or countries. They can analyze the correlation between population density, testing rates, hospitalization counts, and mortality rates to better understand how various factors affect the spread and severity of the virus\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/covid-19-data-resource-hub)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n&gt; - You are free to:\n&gt;      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt;      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt; - You must:\n&gt;      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n&gt;      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n&gt;      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: COVID-19 Activity.csv**\n| Column name                         | Description                                                                                |\n|:------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **PEOPLE_POSITIVE_CASES_COUNT**     | The total number of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases.
