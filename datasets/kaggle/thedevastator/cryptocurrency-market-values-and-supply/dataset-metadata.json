The data offers researchers a comprehensive view of different cryptocurrencies across the globe in terms of value and techniques used to manage their supplies. This data helps us compare different digital currencies while identifying each currency\u2019s potential for growth based on current valuation trends or its susceptibility to volatility. Furthermore, this dataset enables us to research both current developments as well as historical dynamics within the cryptocurrency market. Ultimately, these records provide critical material for gaining a better understanding of the concept that governs digital currency markets and allow users to make informed decisions when choosing between various investments options in a rapidly changing finance industry\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset provides an invaluable insight into the trends of the cryptocurrency market, allowing you to analyze and compare different cryptocurrencies in terms of their market value, circulating supply and volatility. Here's how to get started using this dataset:\n> \n> - Examine the Columns: The dataset includes several columns such as `Name`, `Market_cap`, `Price`, `Circulating_supply` and `Symbol`. It is important to understand what data each column contains before you start exploring the data. \n> - Select Correlated Cryptocurrencies: You can select two or more correlated cryptocurrencies to compare their market values, circulating supplies or prices over time. This allows you to see how changes in one currency affects other currencies. \n> - Filter Results by Price or Market Cap: You can filter your results by setting a specific maximum or minimum price for each cryptocurrency or by setting a maximum/minimum market cap for any given day of analysis. This will help narrow down results that may be hard to interpret due to high variation in values between days or timespans (time series analysis).  \n> - Conduct Time Series Analysis: Start your time series analysis by tracking changes in Price, Market Cap and Circulating Supply over time on a single chart so that you can observe patterns better than if displayed separately; this makes it easier to spot potential correlations between values which might suggest underlying causes causing these changes. \n> 5 Use Models To Forecast Activity In The Cryptocurrency Market : Using Machine Learning models with historic data from this dataset enables more accurate predictions about what could happen in the future create more accurate models about expected future activity going into investing decisions for doing research about long term investments moves that goes beyond short term trading strategies\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Creating a statistical model to predict the price movement of different cryptocurrencies given market conditions and circulating supply;\n> - Analyzing the effect of investing decisions on cryptocurrencies by analyzing historical trends in market capitalization, price, and circulating supply;\n> - Identifying correlations between trading volume and market capitalization or circulating supply in order to better understand how these factors impacts prices over time\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/7342586#.Y9Y4jNJBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
