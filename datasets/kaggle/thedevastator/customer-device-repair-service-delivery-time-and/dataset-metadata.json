It contains recorded events from a home appliance provider's service process, including six different attributes such as activity type, repair time, device type, and service point. Dive deep and explore various factors that could potentially influence overall repair time - customer demand for specific devices types, service points\u2019 performance levels or other external elements - by analyzing this dataset. Examine the role of technical aspects associated with unique device types on customer satisfaction levels as measured through timeliness of repairs. With such large amounts of available data at our fingertips , let\u2019s dive in to understand more about how consumer needs are catered and what can be improved in terms of repair services delivery times and overall performance\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset can be used to study customer device repair processes, delivery times and performance of the service provider. To analyze this data, we must first understand the different columns and their information. \n> \n> ACTIVITY: This column indicates what type of activity related to repair was performed at each timestamp. Examples include 'pickup', 'diagnostics', and 'repairs'. \n> \n> TIMESTAMP: This column lists the date and time when each activity occurred within the repair process. It is useful for assessing how long it took to complete specific steps in a repair job. \n> \n> REPAIR_IN_TIME_5D: This column tells us whether or not a device was repaired within 5 days from its pickup by the service provider. A value of 'yes' indicates that it did, while a value of 'no' means that it did not meet this timeline requirement.  \n>   \n> DEVICETYPE: This column lists the type of device being repaired at each timestamp in the dataset. An example might include something like Washer/Dryer.  \n>    SERVICEPOINT: Finally, this field provides us with which service point (i.e., location) where all repairs where conducted on any given device types picked up from that location for repairs during a given period (if applicable). \n> \n>  With this understanding, you are now ready to begin exploring this data! Start by analyzing temporal trends over time using any combination of these fields (e.g., does repair time differ by Repair Point?) or look into correlations between variables like Device Type vs Repair Time or Activity vs Delivery Time etc.. The possibilities are endless! With insights gained from your statistical explorations, you will gain an increased understanding around how customer devices repairs were processed as well as potential optimization opportunities for future operations based on insights derived from your analysis!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Analyzing the correlation between devices type and repair time \u2013 To identify if certain types of devices take a longer period of time to repair, and provide insights on how to optimize the repair process.\n> - Examining customer reviews regarding service points \u2013 As this dataset contains records from different service points, it can be used to understand how customers rate each point's performance and provide recommendations for improvement.\n> - Predicting Device Repair Time for Different Services Points \u2013 The data can be used to develop an accurate predictive model that takes into account variables related to device types and service points in order to predict the expected time frame for a successful device repair task within 5 days\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/3928487#.Y8OsAtJBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
