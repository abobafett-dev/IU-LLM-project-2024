With details such as trending type, country origin, dates of interest, URLs to find further information, keywords related to the trend and more - it's an invaluable insight into what's driving society today. \n&gt; \n&gt; You can use this data in conjunction with other sources to get ideas for businesses or products tailored to popular desires or opinions. If you are interested in international business perspectives then this is also your go-to source; you can adjust how best to interact with people from certain countries upon learning what they hold important in terms of search engine activity. \n&gt; \n&gt; It also gives key insights into buzz formation by monitoring trends over many countries over different periods of time then analysing whether events tend to last longer or if their effect is short-lived and how much impact it made in terms column \u2018traffic\u2019 \u2013 number of searches for an individual topic \u2013 for the duration of its period affecting higher positions and opinion polls. In addition, marketing / advertising professionals can anticipate what content is likely best received by audiences based off previous trends related images/snippets provided with each trend/topic as well as URL links tracking users who have shown interest.. This way they become better prepared when rolling out campaigns targeted at specific regions/areas taking cultural perspective into consideration rather than just raw numbers. \n&gt; \n&gt; Last but not least it serves perfectly as great starting material when getting acquainted foreigners online (at least we know what conversation starters won't be awkward mentioned!) before deepening our empathetic understanding like terms used largely solely within cultures such as TV program titles\u2026 So\u2026\u2026 question is: What will be next big thing?

It can be used to identify popular topics and find ways to capitalize on them through marketing, business ideas and more. Below are some tips for how to use this data in order to gain insight into global trends and the level of popularity they have. \n&gt; \n&gt; - For **Business Ideas**: Use the URL information provided in order to research each individual trend, analyzing both when it gained traction as well as when its popularity faded away (if at all). This will give insight into transforming a brief trend into a long-lived one or making use of an existing but brief surge in interest \u2013 think new apps related to a trending topic! Combining the geographic region listed with these timeframes gives even more granular insight that could be used for product localization or regional target marketing. \n&gt; \n&gt; - To study **Crowd Behaviour & Dynamics**: Explore both country-wise and globally trending topics by looking at which countries similarly exhibit interest levels for said topics. Go further by understanding what drives people\u2019s interest in particular subjects from different countries; here web scraping techniques can be employed using the URLs provided accompanied with basic text analysis techniques such as word clouds! This allows researchers/marketers get better feedback from customers from multiple regions, enabling smarter decisions based upon real behaviour rather than assumptions.\n&gt; \n&gt; - For **Building Better Products & Selling Techniques: Utilize combine Category (Business, Social etc.), Country and Related keywords mentioned with traffic figures so that you can obtain granular information about what excites people across cultures i.e \u2018Food\u2019 is popular everywhere but certain variations depending upon geo-location may not sell due need catering towards local taste buds.-For example selling frozen food that requires little preparation via supermarket chains showing parallels between nutritional requirements vs expenses incurred while shopping will drive effective sales strategy using this data set . Further combining date information also helps make predictions based upon buyers behaviour over seasons i.e buying seedless watermelons during winter season would be futile . \n&gt; - For Social & Small Talk opportunities - Incorporating recently described concepts such Political opinions seem to evoke higher consensus amongst citizens allowing comprehension between heterogeneous viewpoints etc hence delving deeper into user generated buzz would provide an unique perspective into propelling conversations without opening up hostile debates !  \n&gt; \n&gt;    Ultimately , this dataset has tremendous value even beyond its initial intentions providing enough clues towards\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Developing targeted marketing campaigns based on international trends. By examining the trends in different countries, businesses can tailor their marketing campaigns and product offerings to countries where certain keywords/topics related to their product/service have been trending. \n&gt; - Creating content for influencers and creators based on trending topics. A business could use this dataset to research what are foreign cultures like, which type of content is popular among these foreign cultures and then create better tailored materials for influencers and creators in those areas, who may be greater ambassadors of that business\u2019s brand or products.\n&gt; - Studying how buzz are formed and how long they last by tracking different trend hotness over several countries and several days\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/jfreex)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: primearchive.blogspot.com_detailled-trends_swiss.csv**\n| Column name        | Description                                        |\n|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|\n| **country**        | Country of origin for the trend.
