From the thought-provoking latest release of RPGs to the thrilling adventures of racing games, this database provides an insight into what constitutes as a hit game in today\u2019s gaming industry.  Armed with this data and analysis, future developers can better understand what types of gameplay and mechanics resonate more with players to create a new gaming experience. Through its comprehensive analysis on various game titles, genres and platforms this dataset displays detailed insights into how video games can achieve global success as well as providing a wonderful window into the ever-changing trends of gaming culture\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset can be used to uncover hidden trends in Global Video Games Sales. To make the most of this data, it is important to understand the different columns and their respective values.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The 'Rank' column identifies each game's ranking according to its global sales (highest to lowest). This can help you identify which games are most popular globally. \n&gt; The 'Game Title' column contains the name of each video game, which allows you to easily discern one entry from another. \n&gt; The 'Platform' column lists the type of platform on which each game was released, e.g., PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so that you can make comparisons between platforms as well as specific games for each platform. \n&gt; The 'Year' column provides an additional way of making year-on-year comparisons and tracking changes over time in global video game sales.  \n&gt; In addition, this dataset also contains metadata such as genre ('Genre'), publisher ('Publisher'), and review score ('Review') that add context when considering a particular title's performance in terms of global sales rankings. For example, it might be more compelling to compare two similar genres than two disparate ones when analyzing how successful a select set of titles have been at generating revenue in comparison with others released globally within that timeline. \n&gt; Lastly but no less important are the three variables dedicated exclusively for geographic breakdowns: North America ('North America'), Europe (Europe), Japan (Japan), Rest of World (Rest of World), and Global (Global). This allows us to see how certain regions contribute individually or collectively towards a given title's overall sales figures; by comparing these metrics regionally or collectively an interesting picture arises -- from which inferences about consumer preferences and supplier priorities emerge! \n&gt; \n&gt; Overall this powerful dataset allows researchers and marketers alike a deep dive into market performance for those persistent questions about demand patterns across demographics around the world!\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyzing the effects of genre and platform on a game's success - By comparing different genres and platforms, one can get a better understanding of what type of games have the highest sales in different regions across the globe. This could help developers decide which type of gaming content to create in order to maximize their profits.  \n&gt; - Tracking changes in global video games trends over time - This dataset could be used to analyze how various elements such as genre or platform affect success over various years, allowing developers an inside look into what kind of videos are being favored at any given moment across the world.  \n&gt; - Identifying highly successful games and their key elements- Developers could look at this data to find any common factors such as publisher or platform shared by successful titles to uncover characteristics that lead to a high rate-of-return when creating video games or other forms media entertainment\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/bramwax)\n&gt;  \n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Video Games Sales.csv**\n| Column name       | Description                                                 |\n|:------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Rank**          | The ranking of the game in terms of global sales.
