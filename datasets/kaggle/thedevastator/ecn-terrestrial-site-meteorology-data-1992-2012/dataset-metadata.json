It is an important part of understanding the current and future changes in our environment, standing as a snapshot of conditions before global climate change accelerates. Variables measured include albedo (ground and sky), temperature (dry bulb, wet bulb and soil (at 10cm and 30cm)), relative humidity, radiation (net. and solar), rainfall, surface wetness, soil moisture, wind direction and wind speed - making it an invaluable resource for researchers studying climate change on our planet. ECN is a multi-agency programme sponsored by fourteen government departments/agencies across Britain. Their contribution allows for greater insight into the effects of human activity on our environment so that current conditions can be better evaluated in order to create more sustainable futures.
