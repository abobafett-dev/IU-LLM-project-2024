It contains sixteen (16) recordings of alpha wave activity from twenty (20) individuals who took part in a 2017 resting-state experiment. The recordings were taken using an EEG during the experiment protocol when participants had their eyes open/closed. This valuable resource will enable professionals to gain meaningful insights into brain wave patterns and the measurements of different parts of the brain. Each row represents one electrode recording, and the columns are indexed numerically, providing data points that can be used to interpret complex neurological phenomena in greater detail. This dataset offers an unprecedented opportunity to have access to high-quality EEG data that can facilitate both research into neural processes and indications of neurological disorders\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> In order to use this dataset, users must first download the data files from Kaggle. The data is stored in comma separated value (CSV) format on each file and contains 42 columns representing the subject ID, 16 different electrode recordings from the left or right side of each brain lobe (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital) or junctional area (frontal-central), plus 20 additional alpha wave readings.  \n> \n> Once downloaded onto your preferred system software package or platform such as Python/R/Jupyter notebook/Matlab etc., users can then start to perform some analysis on these datasets which typically involve loading their data into an appropriate container such as a DataFrame structure if they are using Python Pandas modules to manipulate their data. They should also check that all column features are well subjected before proceeding any further by plotting some graphs based off those features provided for a particular test subject over time - (e.g plotting Alpha waves measurements concurrently with corresponding electrode readings). \n>  \n> From there onwards users may invoke machine learning models using either statistical methods or AI algorithms depending on their requirement objectives - emphasizing within supervised ML contexts here where you're applying it to classify distinct patterns within EEG signals generated by multiple participants inside this datasets; Unsupervised ones may be used when trying out clustering applications that would help give better insights into EEG signals comparisons between different participants at rest; Reinforcement learning can be applied to simulate scenarios whereby user wishes to diagnose certain mental conditions among others associated with undesired behaviors being signaled through varying EEG activities recorded over small intervals of time exposed amongst participating subjects tested inside this dataset scenario's respectively \n> \n> Additional more advanced forms of analysis would involve various filtering techniques being employed as part of signal processing operations towards segmenting out undesirable frequencies among complete range spectrums founds within raw electroencephalography signals alongside additional methodological approaches such as Spectroclygrams decompostions etc\u2026to emit maximized spectral power interference therein at desired bands enhancing signal detectability improving accuracy amongst other benefits associated with its effectiveness \n> \n>  Lastly cross correlation processes may also come up inductively useful when prescribed during interpretations performed against multiple sources involving EEG signal chronologies since it\u2019s motioned primarily\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Analyzing Alpha wave activity across diverse brain regions in the resting-state experiment to identify cognitive processes associated with changes in brain electrical activity;\n> - Performing predictive analysis on EEG signals to predict disease progression, risk or changes associated with psychological stress;\n> - Applying Machine-Learning/Artificial Intelligence approaches to compare and classify electroencephalogram recordings from multiple participants for diagnosing neurological diseases and suggesting personalized therapies based on the patient's EEG data\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/2605110#.Y9Y_UNJBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
