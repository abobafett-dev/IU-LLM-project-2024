Split into three sets - training, validation, and test - every set contains conversations with corresponding speaker IDs to form a context, as well as columns for utterance index, prompt/topic of the conversation, self-evaluation of the utterance, and assigned tags. With this deluge of information compiled together in one place it is possible to explore the potentiality of conversation topics further past what we ever thought possible. This dataset has untold possibilities just waiting to be explored!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> ## Getting Started\n> - Begin by downloading the dataset from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/rakshitshah/empathicconversationalmodelbenchmark \n> - The downloaded folder should contain three CSV files - train.csv, validation.csv, and test.csv . These contain conversations with corresponding speaker IDs, topics, self-evaluations, and tags that can be used to train conversation models or evaluate their performance \n> - Each row in each of the three CSV files has 8 columns: index of utterance (utterance_index), context (context), prompt (prompt), utterance (utterance), selfevaluation of utterance (selfevaluation) assigned tags for utterances (tags).  \n> - Utterances are individual statements made by each speaker in the conversation - speakers are identified by ID\u2019s or names included in respective rows under \u2018participants\u2019 column   \n> \n> ## Making Use Of The Dataset \n> - Use train set to create Machine Learning models that can generate natural conversations based on context, assign empathetic scores to generated conversation responses based on sentiment analysis etc 2) Use validation set to run tests and make sure model is functioning correctly 3) Evaluate models using test set 4) Using \u2018tags\u2019 column label different conversations with appropriate tags such as \u2018casual chat\u2019 or \u2018career advice', make comparison between standard & ML model etc\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - To develop empathetic open-domain conversation models for use in virtual assistants or chatbots, such as sorting conversations by topics and training models to reply accordingly.\n> - Utilizing the self-evaluation from each utterance as a metric to observe changes in language atmospheres within conversations, such as mood shifts and tonality variations. \n> - Using the dataset for research purposes that focus on convolutional attention models, LSTMs, seq2seq architectures, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Transformer Networks to further improve conversation model performance and accuracy\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://huggingface.co/datasets/empathetic_dialogues)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
