Included are numerous parameters such as Age, Gender, Marital Status, Business Travel Frequency, Daily Rate of Pay, Departmental Information such as Distance From Home Office or Education Level Obtained by the employee in question. Also included is a variant series of parameters related to the job being performed such as Job Involvement (level), Job Level (relative to similar roles within the same organization), Job Role specifically meant for that individual(function/task), total working hours in a week/month/year be it overtime or standard hours for a given role. Furthermore detailed aspects include Percent Salary Hike during their tenure with the company from promotion or otherwise , Performance Rating based on specific criteria established by leadership , Relationship Satisfaction among peers at workplace but also taking into account outside family members that can influence stress levels in varying capacities ,Monthly Income considered at its starting point once hired then compared against their monthly payrate with overtime hours included if applicable along with Number Companies Worked before if any. Lastly the Retirement Status commonly known as Attrition is highlighted; covering whether there was an intent to stay with one employer through retirement age or if attrition took place for reasons beyond ones control earlier than expected . Through this dataset you can get an insight into various major aspect regarding today's workforce management philosphies which have changed drastically over time due to advancements in technology \n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> - Understand the variables that make up this dataset.
