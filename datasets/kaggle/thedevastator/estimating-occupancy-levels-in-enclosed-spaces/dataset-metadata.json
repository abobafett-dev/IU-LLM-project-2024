The goal is to map this CO2 concentration and temperature to an occupancy variable.\n\n### Description of Data\nEach data record is of the following format\n- **timestamp**: the timestamp of the sample, where the first observation is on Jan 2, 2014\n- **CO2**: the concentration of CO2 in parts-per-million (ppm)\n- **temperature**: the ambient temperature in Celcius\n\n### Using the Training Data\n- The training data consists of observations over multiple weeks, which you can use to build your model.\n- For example, you could assume that there is no change in CO2 levels with the season, or that they are different depending on the month, week, day of the week, time of day. \n- You can also assume that the CO2 levels at a specific time and day are independent of when they were measured. For example, if there is a certain CO2 concentration at 8am on a Wednesday, it should be the same in 2013 and in 2014, etc.\n- You can assume that there is a temperature effect on CO2 levels, but that they are independent of occupancy, i.e., it is reasonable to assume that people produce a similar amount of CO2 regardless of the room temperature.\n",
