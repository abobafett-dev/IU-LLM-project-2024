With data crawled from the website https://wind.met.fu-berlin.de/mvdtext/mvd_text.htm it provides an unprecedented look into how water temperatures have shifted from year to year, as well as providing detailed information on when and where this data was recorded - down to individual lakes! Dive into our data for a closer look at regional temperature fluctuations, get insight into long term trends over time, or just explore - with this data you can do it all!  Found with columns of location, dateTemperature recording the exact moment of when it was taken and degree Celsius temperature logging you can use these records to monitor changes and correlate those changes back to regional factors like weather patterns or urban development impacting bodies of water in the area - all without ever getting your feet wet!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; # How to Use this Dataset\n&gt; This dataset includes historical records of water temperatures of lakes in Berlin, Brandenburg, and the Altmark region. It was crawled from a website that provides information about changes in water temperatures over time and year to year in these regions. The data can be used to determine trends in order to monitor changes in water temperatures over periods of changing weather or other factors. \n&gt; \n&gt; To start using the dataset, it\u2019s important firstly that you familiarise yourself with its columns:location, dateTemperature (the date and time when the temperature was recorded), dateScrape (the date and time when the data was scraped from the website). After understanding what each column indicates; you are then able to identify the lake which has recorded temperature(s) by looking at \u2018location\u2019 column header row entry. \n&gt; \n&gt; By analysing individual entries for each lake within a given period, one will be able ascertain whether there is a sudden change in average water temperature for one particular lake influenced by sources such as localised weather conditions or seasonality etc\u2026 One could also compare various lakes against one another during identical timed intervals as well as evaluating averages across all lakes within Brandenburg or Berlin during a given timeframe too!  Furthermore - utilising \u2018dateTemperature\u2019 column entry along with scraping for updated entries at periodic gaps; monitors regional water temparatures over time enabling users gain insights on applicable regional climate related issues e.g flooding etc\u2026  \n&gt; \n\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Predicting the temperature of various lakes in Berlin, Brandenburg, and Altmark over time. \n&gt; - Establishing a correlation between changes in water temperature and other variables such as atmospheric pressure, rainfall/drought conditions, air temperature etc. \n&gt; - Investigating the effects of climate change on water temperatures in lakes in these regions over extended periods of time\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://github.com/jnsprnw/water-temperatures-berlin)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
