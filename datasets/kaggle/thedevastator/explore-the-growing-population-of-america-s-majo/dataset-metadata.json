Through this dataset, you can explore and analyze the populations of cities across the United States. This dataset has undergone a series of data cleaning activities to help make sure that it is easy-to-use with visualization tools, such as cleaning up names of city and joining all cities into one formatted table. Therefore, allowing you to quickly visualize various aspects - like population trends or city demographics - in order to get an informative understanding about how our country is growing. With this knowledge, engaging in discussions related to city planning recommendations is easier than ever!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; How to Use this Dataset\n&gt; =======================\n&gt; \n&gt; This dataset contains information about the population of the major cities in the United States. The columns in this dataset include city, summary level, place Fips code, state, state Fips code and total population. \n&gt; \n&gt; Using this dataset you can explore a variety of topics related to urbanization including population growth over time and comparative analysis between cities.  You can also use it to study specific social or demographic trends such as age distribution or race/ethnicity among other key metrics.  With the right analysis you could even predict which areas may experience significant growth or decline in their populations over time.  Lastly if you want to compare American cities with other global metropolises then you could easily create aggregate tables that include those data points too!\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Use the data to calculate and demonstrate population growth for cities in the USA over time, providing a strong visual of population changes such as migration, birth/death rates and even shows how urbanization is playing a role in US's population change.\n&gt; - Analyze correlations between population size and economic indicators (such as GDP) across various cities to examine job opportunities or comparative housing prices.\n&gt; - Compare different city populations by state to compare disparate areas of the country and determine how much citizens from one state may be attracted to another based on economic advantages or cultural ties\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/bob-burggraaf)\n&gt;  \n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n&gt; - You are free to:\n&gt;      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt;      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt; - You must:\n&gt;      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n&gt;      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n&gt;      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Total_Population_By_City_Acs_2015_5_E_AgeSex.csv**\n| Column name          | Description                                                           |\n|:---------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **City**             | Name of the city.
