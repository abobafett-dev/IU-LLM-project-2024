It has records of the number of comic books each character appeared in as of April 30, andinformation about their deaths, resurrections from death, honorary Avenger status and more.This dataset provides a unique opportunity to explore the lives of superheroes and villains who have been part of the Avengers team since its foundation and made it one of Marvel's most famous franchises. By looking into theirsuperpowers, appearance frequency, gender, honourary statuses amongst others you can gain insightinto how they came to be part of the Avengers while gaining knowledge that you probably did not haveknown before!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset explores the appearances, deaths, and re-appearances of characters from Marvel's Avengers comic series. Analyzing this data can provide insights into how various characters have developed over time and how often death is used as a plot device in the series. \n&gt; \n&gt; In order to use this dataset effectively, it is important to understand each field included in the dataset. The \u2018URL\u2019 field provides a link to the character\u2019s page on Marvel Wikia, while the \u2018Name/Alias\u2019 field lists their name or any aliases they may go by. The number of comic books that character has appeared in since April 30th is listed under \u2018Appearances\u2019 while their gender can be found in the next column. \n&gt; \n&gt; The \u2018Probationary Introl\u2019 indicates when a particular character was given probationary status as an Avenger and when they were given full or reserve Avenger status is noted under \u2018Full/Reserve Avengers Intro\u2019. The year of joining and number of years since their inclusion into Marvel's list of full-fledged avengers are both provided beside each other for easy comparison ('Year' & 'Years since joining')  respectively; information about honorary statuses accorded them (if any) can be found under 'Honorary'. \n&gt; \n&gt; The subsequent columns deal with deaths & resurrections: Death1 indicates whether or not death however transient has been encountered at least once by that particular Avenger followed by similar information regarding subsequent encounters( up till 5). Each column begins with 'Death' followed by corresponding ones beginning with 'Return'. A more detailed description including cause etc., if available are provided under Notes please use those if required across other fields where applicable   \n&gt; \n&gt;  Finally analyzing this data through trend spotting methods such as line graphs could help discern how circumstances within different stories affect which characters die (temporarily) vs those who live on longer. Cross tabulating against external variables such gender could further deepen our understanding interactions between genders within these series\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Create a timeline to track the rise and fall of characters in the Avengers comic series, tracking their respective storylines over time and providing insight into how they\u2019ve changed. \n&gt; \n&gt; - Showcase a comprehensive gender analysis to compare how male, female, and non-binary characters have grown over time and what roles they were given in each story arc. \n&gt; \n&gt; - Analyze the various plot lines across an entire series, identifying patterns of death used to provide shock value or plot points that progressed their character arcs further with each resurrection\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/fivethirtyeight)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
