The dataset has been parsed to include only the essential data points, such as location, time, weather, contributing factors and demographic information of the motorists involved in the accident. Using this data, researchers can gain valuable insights into automobile safety trends in the Grand Canyon state.\n&gt; \n&gt; The dataset consists of three files - AZ_ACCIDENT (79 columns with 3,904 accidents), AZ_VEHICLE (131 columns with 5,889 vehicles) and AZ_PERSON (96 columns with 10,611 people). It includes translated fields for easy interpretation alongside numerical codes for greater detail about each variable. For example there is WEATHER as a numeric code and WEATHER_LIT as its literal translation. Additionally relevant indicators from auxiliary files are included such as whether a police pursuit was involved or whether a pedestrian was involved or killed. However it does not include every piece of information \u2013 some more arcane fields were not translated nor included in the set such as road use classifications from 2015 NHTSA changes\u2013 so advanced queries may be difficult to perform depending on what is needed out of this data set. \n&gt; \n&gt; Overall this set is great for those looking to gain an understanding of fatal car accident trends in Arizona during its most recent 5 year window but be aware it might require extra effort when performing complex query operations due to exclusions made by NHTSA due either technical difficulty or intentional removal\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset provides detailed information on fatal traffic accidents in Arizona from 2012-2016. It contains three files that provide information about the state of Arizona, the people involved in fatal accidents and the vehicles involved in those accidents. This guide will help you utilize this dataset to better understand and explore the data so that you can draw meaningful insights from it. \n&gt; \n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Using the geographic data to map out locations of fatal accidents in Arizona, and creating an interactive heat map to help identify the highest risk areas for such events. \n&gt; - Analyzing the demographics (age, sex, race) of people involved in fatal accidents and using this information to develop campaigns geared towards high-risk demographic populations. \n&gt; - Investigating relationships between contributing factors to accidents (such as drugs/alcohol use, speed limits, etc.) and fatality rates or types of vehicles involved in accidents to better inform public safety policy or vehicle safety regulations\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/sarahcnyt)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: person.csv**\n| Column name    | Description                                                                                         |\n|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **STATE**      | The state in which the accident occurred.

  "description": "_____\n# Traffic Accidents in Arizona\n### Demographics, Injury Severity, Location, and Other Factors\nBy Sarah Cohen [[source]](https://data.world/sarahcnyt)\n_____\n\n### About this dataset\n&gt; The Arizona fatal accidents dataset contains detailed information on 3,904 fatal car accidents that occurred in the state of Arizona between. The dataset has been parsed to include only the essential data points, such as location, time, weather, contributing factors and demographic information of the motorists involved in the accident. Using this data, researchers can gain valuable insights into automobile safety trends in the Grand Canyon state.\n&gt; \n&gt; The dataset consists of three files - AZ_ACCIDENT (79 columns with 3,904 accidents), AZ_VEHICLE (131 columns with 5,889 vehicles) and AZ_PERSON (96 columns with 10,611 people). It includes translated fields for easy interpretation alongside numerical codes for greater detail about each variable. For example there is WEATHER as a numeric code and WEATHER_LIT as its literal translation. Additionally relevant indicators from auxiliary files are included such as whether a police pursuit was involved or whether a pedestrian was involved or killed. However it does not include every piece of information \u2013 some more arcane fields were not translated nor included in the set such as road use classifications from 2015 NHTSA changes\u2013 so advanced queries may be difficult to perform depending on what is needed out of this data set. \n&gt; \n&gt; Overall this set is great for those looking to gain an understanding of fatal car accident trends in Arizona during its most recent 5 year window but be aware it might require extra effort when performing complex query operations due to exclusions made by NHTSA due either technical difficulty or intentional removal\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset provides detailed information on fatal traffic accidents in Arizona from 2012-2016. It contains three files that provide information about the state of Arizona, the people involved in fatal accidents and the vehicles involved in those accidents. This guide will help you utilize this dataset to better understand and explore the data so that you can draw meaningful insights from it. \n&gt; \n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Using the geographic data to map out locations of fatal accidents in Arizona, and creating an interactive heat map to help identify the highest risk areas for such events. \n&gt; - Analyzing the demographics (age, sex, race) of people involved in fatal accidents and using this information to develop campaigns geared towards high-risk demographic populations. \n&gt; - Investigating relationships between contributing factors to accidents (such as drugs/alcohol use, speed limits, etc.) and fatality rates or types of vehicles involved in accidents to better inform public safety policy or vehicle safety regulations\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/sarahcnyt)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: person.csv**\n| Column name    | Description                                                                                         |\n|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **STATE**      | The state in which the accident occurred.
