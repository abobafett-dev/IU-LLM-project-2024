FQHCs are community-driven and consumer run organizations that serve populations with limited access to health care, including those who are low-income, uninsured, have a limited grasp of English, migrating and seasonal farm workers, individuals experiencing homelessness, and those living in public housing. In addition to detailed location addressing data such as postal code and city name for each center in the scope of this dataset; users can find optional information about an individual center such as its operator description or the type of population it serves, along with rich backroom management data which includes grant number, grantee name and uniform resource locator (URL). Get familiarized with this essential dataset to help provide quality medical care access to under served communities across the US\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset is an address-level dataset on the locations of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). This dataset includes information on the FQHCs such as name, address, contact information, operating hours per week and grant number. It can be used to locate FQHCs in a particular area and to gain insights into the services they provide. \n> \n> In order to use this data set, it is important to understand what attributes are included. These are broken down into categories including basic site information (name, telephone number etc.), service description (what population is served etc.), region info (HHS region code etc.) and supplemental info including records for operator and grantee organization. \n> \n> Once you have identified what fields you are interested in, you can then use this data set for further analysis such as counting how many FQHCs exist within a certain area or determining which states have higher numbers of FQHCs than others. You can also filter by features such as services offered or population served to gain further insights into a particular segment of the FQHC market. \n> \n> It should also be noted that there may be discrepancies between different sources regarding different fields due to variations in data collection methods; however this dataset is sourced from reliable government datasets making it more accurate than other options. Additionally it contains multiple years of data which provides invaluable insight over time trends that would otherwise not be available through other sources\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Monitoring health outcomes in a given region and comparing changes over time in terms of FQHC locations, services available, and populations served.\n> - Analyzing the regional distribution of FQHCs and determining whether there are underserved areas based on population density and access to healthcare services.\n> - Creating a geographic information system (GIS) map to visualize the FQHC locations across the United States, highlighting rural or underserved areas in need of additional support for healthcare access\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/hhs)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **Unknown License - Please check the dataset description for more information.**\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: SITE_HCC_FCT_DET.csv**\n| Column name                                                      | Description                                                                                                   |\n|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Site Name**                                                    | Name of the FQHC.
