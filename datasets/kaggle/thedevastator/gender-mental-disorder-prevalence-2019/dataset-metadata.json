It includes data about eating disorders, bipolar disorder, and population estimates for each country or region included in the dataset. The data reveals mental health disparities across countries and continents by showing different levels of prevalence amongst males versus females. This valuable resource allows us to understand more deeply our current global mental health situation, while also providing an insight into potential areas for improvement and progress in terms of both diagnosis and access to care\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset provides the prevalence of eating disorders and bipolar disorder among males and females in different countries from 2019. This dataset can be useful for researchers looking to compare the prevalence of these mental disorders between genders, or across regions. \n&gt; \n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - To understand geographic patterns in mental health disorders. This data can be used to enhance our understanding of which parts of the world are more likely to experience  different types of mental health disorders and how prevalence can vary from continent to continent.\n&gt; - To compare prevalence between males and females in terms of mental health disorders and highlight potential differences among different areas/countries/continents. \n&gt; - To explore trends in mental health over time and assess which populations have seen the most improvement or decline within a certain period (e.g., check if there is any correlation between trends in bipolar disorder prevalence for males versus those for females across countries)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/reisha0111)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n&gt; - You are free to:\n&gt;      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt;      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt; - You must:\n&gt;      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n&gt;      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n&gt;      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: prevalence-of-eating-disorders-in-males-vs-females.csv**\n| Column name                             | Description                                                                                          |\n|:----------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Entity**                              | The name of the country or region.
