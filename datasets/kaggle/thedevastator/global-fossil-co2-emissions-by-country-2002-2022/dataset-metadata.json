It contains information on total emissions as well as from coal, oil, gas, cement production and flaring, and other sources. The data also provides a breakdown of per capita CO2 emission per country - showing which countries are leading in pollution levels and identifying potential areas where reduction efforts should be concentrated. This dataset is essential for anyone who wants to get informed about their own environmental footprint or conduct research on international development trends\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset provides a country-level survey of global fossil CO2 emissions, including total emissions, emissions from coal, oil, gas, cement, flaring and other sources as well as per capita emissions.\n&gt; \n&gt; For researchers looking to quantify global CO2 emission levels by country over time and understand the sources of these emissions this dataset can be a valuable resource. \n&gt; \n&gt; The data is organized using the following columns: Country (the name of the country), ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 (the three letter code for the country), Year (the year of survey data), Total (the total amount of CO2 emitted by the country in that year), Coal (amount of CO2 emitted by coal in that year), Oil (amount emitted by oil) , Gas (amount emitted by gas) , Cement( amount emitted by cement) , Flaring(flaring emission levels ) and Other( other forms such as industrial processes ). In addition there is also one extra column Per Capita which provides an insight into how much personal carbon dioxide emission is present in each Country per individual .\n&gt; \n&gt;  To make use of these columns you can aggregate sum up Total column for a specific region or help define how much each source contributes to Total column such as how many percent it accounts for out of 100 or construct dashboard visualizations to explore what sources are responsible for higher level emission across different countries similar clusters or examine whether individual countries Focusing on Flaring\u200a\u2014\u200aemissions associated with burning off natural gas while drilling\u2014can improve overall Fossil Fuel Carbon Emission profiles better understanding &nbsp;of certain types nuclear power plants etc.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  The main purpose behind this dataset was to facilitate government bodies private organizations universities NGO's research agencies alike applying analytical techniques tracking environment changes linked with influence cross regions providing resources needed analyze process monitor developing directed ways managing efficient ways get detailed comprehensive verified information  \n&gt; \n&gt;  With insights gleaned from this dataset one can begin identify strategies efforts pollutant mitigation climate change combat etc while making decisions centered around sustainable developments with continent wide unified plans policy implementations keep an eye out evidences regional discrepancies &nbsp;being displayed improving quality life might certainly seem likely assure task easy quickly done \u201cGlobal Fossil Carbon Dioxide Emissions:Country Level Survey 2002 2022 could exactly what us\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Using the per capita emissions data, develop a reporting system to track countries' progress in meeting carbon emission targets and give policy recommendations for how countries can reach those targets more quickly. \n&gt; - Analyze the correlation between different fossil fuel sources and CO2 emissions to understand how best to reduce CO2 emissions at a country-level.\n&gt; - Create an interactive map showing global CO2 levels over time that allows users to visualize trends by country or region across all fossil fuel sources\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/7215364)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
