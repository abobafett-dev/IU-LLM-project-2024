Mental health is a critical and complex issue which touches us all and this dataset allows a deeper dive into the quantitative understanding of its prevalence and geographical distribution. With this data at hand one can gain insight on questions such as: which countries have rates of mental illness that are higher or lower than average? Which regions are disproportionately dealing with certain types of mental health disruptions? Who is struggling with particular types of illnesses? This data provides answers to those inquiries as well as helping us gain a better understanding of how we can take action towards increasing global awareness, prevention efforts, and access to vital resources that help individuals become healed and empowered\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset provides information on the prevalence of mental health disorders globally, with data collected from various countries in a given year. It includes statistics on several types of mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, drug use disorders and depression. \n> \n> Using this dataset can provide useful insights into the prevalence of mental health conditions worldwide. This could be used to better understand how different countries are affected by mental health issues and to identify areas that may need more help or attention. The data is broken down by country or region and year to allow for a better understanding of trends over time. \n> \n> To use this dataset effectively for research or data analysis purposes it is important to first familiarize yourself with the columns available in the dataset: Entity (country/region), Code (country code), Year (year in which the data was collected), Schizophrenia (%) , Bipolar Disorder (%) , Eating Disorders (%) , Anxiety Disorders (%) , Drug Use Disorders (%) , Depression (%) and Alcohol Use Disorders (%). Each column represents a specific type of mental health disorder and provides information on its prevalence rate in each country/region during that calendar year. \n> \n> Once you have an understanding of these columns you can begin analyzing the data to gain further insights into global trends related to these mental health conditions. You might perform descriptive analyses such as finding average percentages across different groups (e.g., genders) or time periods, as well as performing inferential analyses like assessing relationships between different variables within your data set (e.g., correlation). Additionally you could create visualizations such as charts, maps or other graphics that help make sense out of large amounts of statistical information easily accessible to a wider audience\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Creating age-group specific visualizations and infographics that compare the prevalence of mental health disorders in different countries or regions to better understand how the issue of depression or anxiety intersects with factors such as gender, culture, or socioeconomic status. \n> - Creating a global map visualization that shows the prevalence of different mental health disorders in different countries/regions to demonstrate disparities between places and provide a way for policy makers to better target areas most affected by these issues. \n> - Developing data visualizations exploring relationships between demographic variables (e.g., gender, age) and prevalence of mental health disorder types such as depression or anxiety disorders in order to gain insight into possible correlations between them\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/amitd)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Mental health Depression disorder Data.csv**\n| Column name                   | Description                                                                           |\n|:------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Entity**                    | The name of the country or region.
