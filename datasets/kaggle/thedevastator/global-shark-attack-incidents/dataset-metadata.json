It offers valuable information on various aspects of each incident, including the date and location of the attack, specific details about the activity the victim was engaged in at the time, and whether it resulted in a fatality or not. With additional columns such as age, injury description, and even the name of the victim involved, this dataset aims to inform people about the risks associated with coastal water activities.\n> \n> The dataset also sheds light on factors that contribute to shark attacks by providing information on the type of incident, such as whether it was provoked or unprovoked. It further categorizes incidents based on different countries and areas within those countries where they occurred. The presence of additional columns like investigator or source helps trace back to their reporting sources for further verification and analysis.\n> \n> Moreover, this dataset goes beyond numbers and text by including links to PDF files containing more detailed information about each shark attack incident. This allows researchers or interested individuals to delve deeper into individual cases for better understanding.\n> \n> To facilitate data visualization and exploration, several columns provide configurations related to encoding and mark type used in visualization tools. The inclusion of original order column helps maintain consistency while handling large datasets.\n> \n> In summary, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers studying shark attacks worldwide while aiming to improve understanding between sharks and humans through education on associated risks during coastal water activities\n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> \n> - Understand the Columns:\n>    - Case Number: A unique identifier for each shark attack incident.\n>    - Type: The type of shark attack incident, such as Unprovoked or Provoked.\n>    - Country: The country where the shark attack incident occurred.\n>    - Area: The specific area within the country where the shark attack incident occurred.\n>    - Location: The location or beach where the shark attack incident occurred.\n>    - Activity: The activity the victim was engaged in at the time of the shark attack incident.\n>    - Name: The name of the victim involved in the shark attack incident.\n>    - Age: The age of the victim involved in the shark attack incident.\n>    - Injury: The description of the injury sustained by the victim in a shark attack incident.\n>    - Fatal (Y/N): Indicates whether or not a fatality occurred in a given shark attack incident.\n> \n> - Explore Attack Types:\n>     Use information from Type column to analyze different types of attacks like Unprovoked or Provoked incidents. Identify patterns or trends and gain insights into factors contributing to various types of attacks.\n> \n> - Analyze Geographic Trends:\n>     Utilize data from Country and Area columns to identify regions with higher concentrations of recorded incidents. Compare different countries and areas to understand geographic trends regarding locations prone to attacks.\n> \n> - Study Activity-Related Incidents:\n>     Focus on data from Activity column to examine activities that often lead to sharks encountering humans. Determine which activities pose higher risks and develop guidelines or recommendations accordingly.\n> \n> - Investigate Victim Characteristics:\n>     Analyze data from Name and Age columns to study the profiles of victims involved in shark attack incidents. Identify any patterns or demographics that might be useful in understanding the prevalence of attacks.\n> \n> - Assess Injury Severity:\n>     Explore data from Injury column to gain insights into different types and severities of injuries resulting from shark attacks. Analyze patterns and determine the most common injuries sustained by victims.\n> \n> - Consider Fatality Rates:\n>    Examine the Fatal (Y/N) column to determine fatality rates associated with shark attack incidents. Compare fatality rates across different countries, areas, or activity types to understand risks\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Analyzing the relationship between shark attacks and specific activities: This dataset can be used to study patterns and trends in shark attacks based on the activity the victim was engaged in at the time of the incident. By analyzing this information, researchers can identify which activities are more likely to result in a shark attack and develop strategies to mitigate those risks.\n> - Understanding geographical patterns of shark attacks: The dataset includes information on the specific area within each country where shark attacks occur. By analyzing this data, researchers can identify geographic hotspots for shark attacks and gain insights into factors that may contribute to increased risk in certain areas. This information can be used for public safety measures, such as warning systems or beach monitoring.\n> - Investigating factors influencing fatality rates: The dataset includes information on whether each shark attack incident resulted in a fatality or not. Researchers can analyze this data to understand factors that may influence fatality rates, such as the type of attack (provoked or unprovoked), location, or time of day. This analysis could lead to better understanding of how to prevent fatal outcomes in future incidents and improve emergency response protocols\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/siyeh)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n> - You are free to:\n>      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n>      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n> - You must:\n>      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n>      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n>      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: GSAF5.xls.csv**\n| Column name                | Description                                                                                        |\n|:---------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Case Number**            | A unique identifier for each shark attack incident.
