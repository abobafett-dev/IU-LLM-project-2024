Using this data, researchers can delve deep into the effects of these trends across countries and ultimately uncover important insights about the state of global health. The dataset contains information about suicide rates (per 100,000 people), mental disorder prevalence (as a percentage of population size in 2017), population share with substance use disorders (as a percentage from 1990-2016), GDP per capita by purchasing power parity (in terms of current US$ for 1990-2017) and net national income per capita adjusted for inflation effects(in current US$, as in 2016). Additionally it tracks unemployment rate among populations over time(populaton%, 1991-2017). All this will help us to better understand how issues such as suicide, mental health and substance use disorders are affecting the lives of people globally\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset offers insights into how mental health, substance use disorders, and economic status can impact global suicide trends. To get the most out of this data set, it is important to note the various columns available and their purpose as outlined above. \n> \n> To analyze global suicide rates, look at the column \u201cProbability (%) of dying between age 30 and exact age 70 from any of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease\u201d for a summary of estimated suicide rates for different countries over time. Additionally the columns \u201cEntity\u201d and \u201cCode\u201d provide useful information on which country is being discussed in each row. \n> \n> The column \u201cPrevalence- Alcohol and Substance Use Disorders\u201d provides an overview of substance use disorders across different countries while the year column indicates when these trends are taking place. \n> \n> For economic indicators related to mental health there is data available on national income per capita (current US$, 2016) as well as unemployment rate (population % 1991-2017). Together these metrics give a detailed picture into how economics can be interlinked with mental health and potentially suicide rates. \n> \n>  Finally this dataset also allows you to investigate varying trends overtime between different countries by looking at any common metrics but only in one specific year using appropriate filters when exploring the data set in more detail\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Analyzing the correlation between mental health and economic indicators.\n> - Identifying countries with the highest prevalence of substance use disorders and developing targeted interventions for those populations.\n> - Examining the impact of global suicide rates over time to increase awareness and reduce stigma surrounding mental health issues in different countries\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/1468866#.Y8OqpNJBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
