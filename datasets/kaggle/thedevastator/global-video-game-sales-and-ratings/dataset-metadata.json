Predominantly prepared with the intent of facilitating data-driven decision making, this dataset serves as an essential tool for game developers, publishers, critics and researchers interested in examining trends and patterns within this burgeoning domain.\n> \n> Consisting of a wide gamut of variables such as platform availability, genre classification, publishing entities involved, developers responsible for creating the games to understanding their global reach through sales figures across various regions including North America (NA_Sales), Europe (EU_Sales), Japan (JP_Sales) and even other diverse regions consolidated under 'Other_Sales'- this dataset offers an in-depth exploration into the intricacies inherent in video gaming business dynamics.\n> \n> Furthermore, since it includes both critic reviews and user ratings along with associated count metrics that denote how many individuals voiced their opinion via these ratings; it not only lends performance transparency but also ensures broad inclusivity to make assessment more holistic. Therein lies its uniqueness: aptly capturing both market reception (sales diligence) along with perceptual quality review criteria led by expert critics and public users alike.\n> \n> To facilitate a thorough understanding our array fields also cover critical detail including 'Year_of_Release', offering temporal insight into when these games arrived on market shelves around the world; how they have been categorized ('Genre'), which platforms host these games ('Platform'); who took responsibility for developing them ('Developer') & then getting them promoted or distributed to target consumer base ('Publisher').\n> \n> Our 'User_Count' column offers further informed perspective about community engagement levels while inclusion of 'Rating' variable provides standards-based categorical info about age-specific content appropriateness as per internationally recognized rating agency- Entertainment Software Rating Board. With all these multifaceted components combined together in one robust dataset- rich analysis like sales forecasting, trend identification or patterns discernment among others can be most effectively accomplished.\n> \n> By providing such a wealth of diverse and detailed information, this dataset opens up a world of possibilities for analysis and investigation that stretches the boundaries of what we can learn about video games- both as entertainment artifacts and as commercial entities. Overall this dataset stands to be an  informative resource to better comprehend the complex dynamics shaping the globally-flourishing video game industry\n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> \n> This guide will provide tips on how to effectively navigate this dataset for both beginners in Data Science and researchers with more advanced skills.\n> \n> - **Getting Started:** Familiarize yourself with the general contents of the data file by checking all column descriptions. This will give you an overarching understanding of what kind of data you can find in this dataset.\n> \n> - **Conceptual Understanding:** Understand the context each column provides for every unique video game title:\n> \n> - **Platform**: Can help highlight which gaming platforms have optimal sales.\n>     \n> - **Year_of_Release**: Can provide insights into gaming market trends or allow creation of timeline analysis.\n>     \n> - **Genre**: Useful for analyzing popular genres or identifying niche markets.\n>     \n> - **Publisher / Developer**: Monitoring these can reveal industry leaders or developers that consistently produce well-received games.\n>     \n> - **NA_Sales / EU_Sales / JP_Sales / Other_Sales / Global_Sales** : These columns are instrumental in performing regional market analyses, studying performance indicators globally, or comparing regional popularity differences versus global acceptance levels.\n> \n> - **User Scores Vs Critic Scores:** These two columns might present divergent perspectives about a video-game's quality; critics might highly rate games users didn't favor & vice versa. Exploring these discrepancies could prove intriguing!\n> \n> -  **Choosing Tasks:**\n> \n>     - *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: This could be your first step if you're starting out learning how to handle datasets; identify missing values/nulls & their impact on data analysis; extract meaningful summary statistics.\n> \n>     - *Data Visualization*: Generate charts, scatter plots, heat maps etc. to encapsulate sales trends; plot the popularity of different genres over time or compare user vs critic scores.\n> \n>     - *Predictive Modelling*: With features like genre, platform, developer etc., you might predict future sales figures or game ratings.\n>     \n> - **Ratings & Sales Correlation:** Analyze how a game's ESRB rating impacts its sales and overall reception. Do Mature games sell more than Everyone-rated ones?\n> \n> Remember! This dataset offers loads of opportunities to perform extensive statistical analysis and data exploration on video gaming as a business industry\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - **Video Game Sales Forecasting:** This dataset can be used to forecast global and regional future sales of video games based on data like genre, platform, publisher, critic scores, and user scores. By understanding what factors drive high sales in a particular region or globally, game developers and publishers can strategize their development and marketing plans.\n> - **Success Predictor Model:** A machine learning model can be developed that predicts the success of a new video game before its release in terms of its user score, critic score or projected sales. The predictor variables could be features like genre, platform etc.\n> - **Market Segmentation Analysis:** The dataset could provide insights about different market segments within the gaming industry - for example what genres/platforms are popular in which regions? What type of games (based on ESRB ratings) tend to have higher user counts? Both developers and publishers can use this information while deciding which kind of games to develop/publish next\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/learn-to-viz)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: video_games_sales.csv**\n| Column name         | Description                                                                                   |\n|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Platform**        | The gaming console for which the game was developed.
