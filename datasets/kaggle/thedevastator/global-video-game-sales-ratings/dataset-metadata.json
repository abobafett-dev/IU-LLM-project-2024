Traditionally categorised by genre, publisher, platform and rating, this data also includes additional descriptive attributes such as 'story focus', 'gameplay focus', and whether it is a 'series game'. These unique descriptors give valuable perspective on the video game industry, presenting an invaluable resource to evaluate the effect of focusing on storytelling upon video game sales and ratings. \n> \n> The wide-reaching implications of this data are immense - from understanding complex customer \u2018gamer\u2019 engagement processes across different markets & genres to exploring how narrative elements have become increasingly commonplace in popular titles. In addition to traditional research topics ranging from rating vs success relationships or the importance of series games in retention - all these aspects combined present endless possibilities for deeper studies into an ever-evolving field! \n> \n> Ultimately, this dataset gives researchers the power to profoundly analyse trends within the gaming market with informative and expansive details regarding popularity - helping developers craft engaging experiences for all customers worldwide. Henceforth we invite you on a journey into uncovering surprising revelations that may form part of wider conversations & culture surrounding gaming!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset contains data on global video game sales and ratings, including information such as genre, publisher, platform, rating, story focus and gameplay focus for each game. It is a great resource for understanding how storytelling affects the success of video games, as well as looking into other trends across different markets and genres. In this guide we'll provide some tips on how to make use of the data provided in this dataset most effectively. \n> \n> - Familiarise yourself with the columns included: there are a range of columns that will be useful when exploring the dataset such as \u2018Genre\u2019, \u2018Publisher\u2019 \u2018Platform\u2019 etc., so get familiar with what they mean before using them to dive deeper into your research questions. \n> \n> - Use descriptive attributes: There are a number of additional attributes added to each entry such as 'story focus' and 'gameplay focus', so you can delve deeper into these categories for further insight - particularly when comparing them to sales/ratings numbers for enhanced understanding of correlations between elements like story-telling and customer engagement or game success overall. \n> \n> - Evaluate wider trends: Look at larger trends such as changes in series games over time or genre differences between regions from other perspectives by taking into account more than just sale/rating numbers \u2013 e.g adding specific customer reviews or developer feedback can give unique insights beyond just traditional metrics alone! \n> \n> 4 Utilise comparison tools: There are many powerful comparison tools available like heatmaps that allow you to quickly identify interesting relationships between different variables in your dataset \u2013 try experimenting with these!  \n> \n> 5 Expand your scope: Get creative by without relying too heavily on sales figures; think about spinoff products or other ancillary goods related to each title \u2013 could they offer valuable insights? Does their success correlate with video game performance? Do brand partnerships help extend customer engagement ? \n> \n>  These are just a few tips but hopefully they provide food-for-thought while thinking about research questions that this dataset might help answer!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Studying the effectiveness of awards and accolades in promoting video game sales, specifically analyzing differences between story-focused games and gameplay-focused games. \n> - Examining the effect of platform variety on a single game's success, using this dataset to track metrics across multiple platforms and series titles. \n> - Exploring whether user preferences or review scores are better predictors of sales success by studying different ratings across different types of stories (i.e., comedy vs tragedy) or gameplay focus (strategy vs action)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/2454579#.Y9Y2c9JBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
