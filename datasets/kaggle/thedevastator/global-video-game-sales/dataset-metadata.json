Observe which platforms are driving global sales, what genres have been most successful in different regions across the world, and how both of these factors have changed over time. Analyze this data to inform your understanding of the gaming industry and discover trends propelling game developers to success!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset provides an excellent snapshot of the top 100-selling video games, along with their respective platforms, genres and publishers. By analyzing the data provided in this Kaggle dataset, it is possible to gain insights on the popularity of different gaming platforms and the most successful genres associated with those platforms. Additionally, one can also observe which publishers have achieved success in publications of multiple series or even single titles. \n> \n> In order to begin making use of this dataset effectively, start by looking through each column and determining how it might be contributing useful information. This dataset contains 11 columns: rank (ranked from 1-100), name (name of title), platform (platform game was released for), year (year game was released), genre (genre classification for title), publisher (publisher responsible for release), NA_sales & EU_sales & JP_sales & other_sales  (total fractions of sales worldwide by region) & global_sales(total fractional sales worldwide). These columns can be used to draw comparisons between various specific aspects or discover general trends about certain parts of the industry over a prolonged period of time. \n> \n> Those wanting to understand more specifically how certain releases have performed over time should consider using graphs/charts to depict their findings; as diagramatic visual representations always make understanding easier while also providing insight that wouldn\u2019t have been visible through raw data alone. To further narrow down your focus on subsets within subsets, implement crosstabs! Keywords are also incredibly helpful when sifting through large amounts - search queries allow you to find further info based on detailed parameters while restriction allows fine tuning these queries into very specific datasets you need in order to answer any given question properly!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Probing the relationship between video game expenditure and user satisfaction to understand consumer behavior. \n> - Examining the most popular platform-genre combinations in the top 100 games to inform game development decisions. \n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/5898311#.Y9Y2K9JBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
