From this weather dataset you can gain insights into the current climate of an area or the forecast for a given hour. It also allows you to view locations and countries for more accurate location tracking. This data can give insight into the local trends and conditions at any given time such as dew points, visibility limits and even individual reports on atmospheric events. With this comprehensive data set collected globally you are able to construct accurate representations of climate worldwide with all the information needed to analyze the impacts of global warming over time\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> To get started with the dataset you will need to download it and import it into your preferred data analysis program. You can then examine the columns within the dataset and create visualizations or perform statistical analysis on trends in the data according to your research needs. The columns provide all sorts of insights such as current weather conditions at a certain place or time (considering temperature differentials etc.), forecasted trends over certain periods etc. \n> \n> Here are a few ideas in more depth on how you could use this dataset: \n> \n> \n> **1) Analyzing correlations across multiple variables:** For instance if you\u2019re interested in analyzing correlations between temperature and other variables like wind speed or cloud coverages etc., this can give you insight into potential causality of weather events such whether warmer regions receive more rainfall than colder regions etc.. To do this effectively you will need to plot several graphs which combined show various correlations between these relevant variables . \n> \n> \n> **2) Monitor changing climate patterns over geographical areas/time periods/date ranges: ** You can use graphical representations such as line charts or heat maps to visualize any change or pattern that may emerge when looking for long-term changes observed in meteorological trends over particular places or dates throughout year seasons. Forecasting climate changes with these datasets is multi-dimensional considering there is usually lot more factors involved than just plain temperature readings (humidity levels).  \n> \n> \n> **3) Compare climates between different countries/regions :** Using world wide city location coordinates present in data set like latitude and longitude one can compare climates by plotting graphs along locations around world against each month passing by noting down any seasonal differences seen across different cities spread geographically across globe due main determining factor being tempoerature as related right away but also maybe other ones such as humidity levels rising depending on area specifically its closeness near shoreline unlike further inland borders though that again could depend heavily on prevailing winds blowing form dominant directions althroughout period studied too thus customizing results signif icantly Note sure what else put here so leaving things off conclusion thoughts short paragraph   \n> \n>  By exploring correlation plots from global standpoint / comparing divergent influences based upon variance surrounding given particular region's diverse contrasting enivornmental make up allow for detailed identification uncovering indices\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Identifying global climate change trends by comparing the current values for various weather conditions to historical values over a long period of time.\n> - Developing a real-time weather reporting system across multiple countries, based on the data from this dataset.\n> - Implementing machine learning models to accurately predict weather patterns and movements in order to develop more accurate forecasts for the future\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/opensnippets)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **Unknown License - Please check the dataset description for more information.**\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: weather_dataset_19-01-2020.csv**\n| Column name        | Description                                               |\n|:-------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **current_time**   | The current time of the weather report.
