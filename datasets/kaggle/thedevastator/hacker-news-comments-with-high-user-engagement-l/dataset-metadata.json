It contains over 10,000 comments by more than 10 authors on Hacker News stories with more than 10 comments. Each comment is tagged with its story_id, story_time, story_url, story_text, story_author and comment_id, providing an in-depth look at the relationships between these users and their interactions with the stories they are commenting on. Discover new insights about user behavior when discussing technology and innovation by examining this data - build profiles for each commenter and track patterns of conversation as it progresses over time. Find out which topics draw high engagement levels from multiple users to provide a clearer picture of how people contribute to conversations in the tech sector. With this dataset you can gain powerful insights into highly engaged conversations that provide valuable information to those working in technology today!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> - Download the dataset from Kaggle and read through it to get a better understanding of what data is available in the dataset. Examine the various columns such as Story Time, Story URL, Story Text, Story Author, Comment Text, Comment Author, Comment Ranking, Author Comment Count and Story Comment Count \n> - Take a look at all of these variables as well as any additional data that may be associated with them \u2013 for example if there are different story topics that are associated or have influence over engagement levels of users or comments by authors.  \n> - Gather several examples from each variable in order to familiarise yourself more with how they interact and relate to one another within this particular dataset; you can use Excel\u2019s \u201cFind and Replace\u201d tool or manually sort through each field \u2013 whatever works best for you! Utilizing this method should help you gain an improved understanding of how these variables interact with one another throughout the entire dataset which can give you valuable insights into user behavior patterns within Hacker News comments specifically. \n> - Create your own user clusters based on authorship & comment activity (this can either be done manually or using predefined algorithms like K-means clustering). This will enable us to identify trends in conversations depending on who is involved & active in the discussion; this could provide us with information regarding conversation dynamics & narrative structure which could hint at topics related to technology nd innovation that may interest viewers most heavily etc.. Additionally just like we mentioned before we can draw correlations between comment activity/ranking amongst other factors such as story time posted or type posted too! \n> - Analyze whether or not any changes occurred over time due to various engagement levels among authors & their stories \u2013 perhaps there were changes made when it comes down to commenting habits upon starting threads/stories? These changes could also help inform decisions about content delivery/hosting strategies for future posts shared online via Hacker News (or other mediums). Taking into account things like sentiment towards certain topics within engaging conversations might even provide interesting insights when determining product development paths next steps pursue during product launch cycles etc... There is still so much left undiscovered here don\u2019t let those opportunities go untapped - enjoy!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Tracking user engagement on different stories, as well as analyzing how posts are interconnected through comment replies and topics.  \n> - Measuring the impact of lengthy conversations on a story's overall rating or comment count; \n> - Creating user profiles based on the frequency of their comments, the topics they engage with, their reactions to other users' comments and their contribution to specific stories\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/45901)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
