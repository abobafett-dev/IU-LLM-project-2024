With the help of Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey data, annual percentages of NYS adult population with or without health insurance are shown for a variety of demographic and geographic categories including New York City/Rest of State, DSRIP Region, Sex, Race/Ethnicity, Age Group, Education level, Income level and Limitation Status (through 2017). Moreover, Disability Status and Mental Health Status have been listed starting from 2016. The sample size varies annually with a range between 6800-36000 completed interviews which cover almost all non-institutionalized adults across the state.

The data is collected from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a random digit dialing (RDD) phone survey. The columns of the dataset provide a range of demographic and geographic categories, such as New York City/Rest of State, sex, race/ethnicity, age, education level, income level, limitation status through 2017), disability status beginning in 2016), employment status and mental health status.\n> \n> Using this dataset can help you to understand trends in health care coverage for adults in New York State over recent years. It can also be used to compare different demographic groups on their likelihood of having health insurance coverage or not. \n> \n> To use this dataset: \n> - Read the Terms of Service for the Data License Requirements section at https://data.ny.gov/download/77gx-ii52/application/pdf before using the data \t\t\t\t    \n> - Download and familiarize yourself with thiscsv file \u2018health-care-coverage-status-brfss-beginning\u20132011\u20131\u2019 on Kaggle \t     The columns contain: Characteristic# Year# Demographic Category# Demographic Group# Overall Sample Size# Overall Population Size #Sample Cases with Characteristic# Estimated Population with Characteristic # Percentage with Characteristic \t      3) Start exploring which factors influence and potentially differ people\u2019s likelihood of having access to healthcare by touring through different variables within various demographic and geographic categories     4) Make exploratory analysis to transform raw data into insights which helps answer particular questions regarding healthcare access across certain groups or regions within NYS        5) Identify patterns observed studying proportion between estimated populations vs overall population size among selected group(s).   6) Verify any discrepancies based on percentage comparison between estimated populations vs overall population size among selected group(s).   7 ) Create visualizations or reports that communicate your findings\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Using this dataset, policymakers and researchers can analyze the data to identify populations that are at risk of having inadequate access to healthcare, and work to address those needs.\n> - Health providers and non-profits can use the data to better target their services based on demographic characteristics of people in need of healthcare services \n> - Universities can leverage the dataset for medical research projects and studies to understand patterns in health care coverage among different demographics over time in New York State\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/healthdatany)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: health-care-coverage-status-brfss-beginning-2011-1.csv**\n| Column name                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|:---------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Characteristic**                           | This column represents a characteristic measuring health care coverage status as well as mental health status such as having insurance, being uninsured, having psychotic disorder, etc. (Categorical) |\n| **Year**                                     | This column indicates which year\u2019s data is represented in each row.
