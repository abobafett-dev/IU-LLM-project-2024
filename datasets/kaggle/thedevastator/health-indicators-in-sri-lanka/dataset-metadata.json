Moreover, this dataset further contains indicators related to the service organization and delivery of treatment capacity and treatment coverage in Sri Lanka. All necessary links for individual indicator metadata are included in the resource descriptions. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is important to note that data in this dataset is best viewed as statistical estimates meant to inform decision makers on current trends in public health initiatives. Nevertheless it is essential that due caution be taken when using them due to their potential limitations such as geographical imprecision or outdatedness derived from when they were last updated. The license accompanying this dataset has been provided by Other which can be more FULLY understood by visiting the HUMDATA website link found within this description which also serves as access point for further documentation on how the data was collected through the use of registries used at source level\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; The health indicators dataset for Sri Lanka provides important data on various areas, ranging from mortality and global health estimates to service organization and delivery of treatment capacity. This dataset is a great resource for analyzing the health status of Sri Lankan citizens and understanding some of the underlying drivers. \n&gt; \n&gt; This guide outlines how to use this dataset, including a quick overview of what\u2019s included, how to access the data, and an explanation about the columns in the dataset. \n&gt; \n&gt; ##### What's Included? \n&gt; The Health Indicators for Sri Lanka dataset includes 68 indicators from a range of categories such as mortality rates, disease prevalence rates, treatment coverage rates, pharmaceutical drug spending and more. The region column in the metadata specifies which area within Sri Lanka each indicator is measured against (e.g., national level). The country column states that all values correspond to information related to Sri Lanka only. In addition to numerical values like percentages or counts per million people (M), you will also find categorical information such as sex or types of drugs available at a certain facility/location in your query results.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ##### Accessing Data \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ##### Understanding Metadata Columns: \t\t\t\t\t       \n&gt; The metadata columns include codes used by data publishers along with description fields which help provide context for understanding analytical findings based off analysis conducted using this datasets: GHO CODE \u2013 Global Health Observatory code; ENDYEAR \u2013 Year when data was collected ; COUNTRY CODE \u2013 Country Code 'CL' identifies Country name -SriLanka; SEX DISPLAY \u2013 Gender measured (e g male female); NUMERIC VALUE \u2013 numbers indicating counts per million people M ; GhO DISPLAY\u2013name associated with Gho code ; PUBLISHSTATE CODE\u2013code used by publisher designates publication status; PUBLISHSTATE DISPLAY -name associated with publishstate code ;PUBLIC STATE URL location where additional info found\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Mapping Sri Lanka's health infrastructure and visualizing the distribution of health resources across the country.\n&gt; - Analyzing the trends in health indicators for different demographic groups to identify correlations between risk factors and public health outcomes in Sri Lanka.\n&gt; - Creating predictive models to forecast how changes in countries policies or advances in medical technology might impact public health outcomes in Sri Lanka over a period of time\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/humdata)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: quickcharts-indicators-for-sri-lanka-1.csv**\n| Column name        | Description                                                    |\n|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **GHO (CODE)**     | The Global Health Observatory code for the indicator.
