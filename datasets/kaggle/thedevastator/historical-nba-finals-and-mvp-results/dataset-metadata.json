You can use this data to explore moments in history when one conference dominated over the other or to see changes in player dynamics over time. Additionally, you can comb through this dataset to determine which nation has produced dominant MVPs and compare positional contributions throughout various eras of basketball by examining height measurements in both metric and imperial units. With a closer look at these historical figures, teams, and events on this dashboard you\u2019ll get a better understanding how our favorite sport has evolved over time\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> To begin, let\u2019s take a look at the columns listed in this dataset: \n> - Year: The year of the NBA Finals.
