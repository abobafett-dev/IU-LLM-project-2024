This comprehensive dataset contains an array of data points that provides insights into factors such as track conditions, weather conditions, total wagers across all runners which can be used to get a clearer understanding on how various elements may influence the outcome of each race. The Markets.csv file also includes crucial details like start time and race number in addition to pool winnings and place margins for each runner in the race. Furthermore, data collected from tipsters can be found within runners.csv along with the odds paid out on each runner's win and place market, form rating of each horse in its past three races, handicap weight and barriers they started from among other metrics. And finally, auxiliary files like conditions CSV which identifies track condition at separate levels or weathers CSV which names weather during particular races provide useful context for understanding when viewing this data set. Through these metrics it is possible gain an insight into what impacts play a bigger role when trying to predict winners so you can increase your chances at placing successful bets!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset provides data on horse racing market analysis and prediction, including race results, information on the runners and their form, details about the weather and track conditions, odds from various sources, and tips from tipsters. \n&gt; \n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyzing betting odds for different races and predicting which horses have the highest probability of winning or placing based on the collected data.\n&gt; - Comparing weather conditions relative to performance in a race and determining if there is a correlation between the two. \n&gt; - Creating a predictive model that analyzes different factors such as form ratings, distances, handicap weights or blinkers to provide informed tips for horse racing bettors and punters\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/sya)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)**\n&gt; - You are free to:\n&gt;      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for non-commercial purposes only.\n&gt;      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for non-commercial purposes only.\n&gt; - You must:\n&gt;      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n&gt;      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n&gt; - You may not:\n&gt;      - **Use the material for commercial purposes**.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: runners.csv**\n| Column name              | Description                                                                        |\n|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **collected_at**         | The date and time the data was collected.
