It can be used by anyone looking to compare power market prices between regions and systems, or by energy producers or traders seeking to estimate future prices.\n&gt; \n&gt; To use this dataset, users need to first select the column that corresponds with their desired price metric (sistema). Then they must select the type of currency (tipo_moneda) for which they want to analyze the data. Lastly, users should select the system (sistema) for which they want to get price information for their selected currency type. \n&gt; Once these criteria are defined, users can then analyze trends in pricing over time by using the fecha and hora columns.
