With this dataset, you can gain insights into daily phone usage habits and determine the effect that regular yoga practice has on reducing phone use. By recording the amount of time spent using different types of apps -- such as social media, reading, productivity and entertainment -- you can understand how phone habits have changed over time. Moreover, this dataset captures my attempt to do at least 10 minutes of yoga every day for a period of 15 days from April 29th to May 13th. Did this experiment successfully reduce my screen time overall?

This is useful for gaining insights into an individual's screen time habits and its variability with respect to doing yoga. \n&gt; \n&gt; To start with, there are a few key columns to check out: Date (to keep track of the days in view), Week Day (to identify which day it is precisely), Social Networking/Reading and Reference/Other/Productivity/Health and Fitness (to determine how much time was spent in each category) and Yoga (whether or not any yoga was done that day). \n&gt; \n&gt; You may find it helpful to analyze the daily data over a certain duration by creating separate datasets grouped by weeks or months. Additionally, tallying each person's total minutes per week or per month can show changes over long-term periods. As you will notice right away in viewing this dataset, consistency is important; if someone were tracking their smartphone use regularly but only measured twice during a month period or skipped days without setting aside any reference points prior, then this particular experiment would be somewhat difficult to draw conclusions from. It would be especially impactful if specific factors such as sleep hygiene were tracked along with practice evolution such us advanced yoga sequences tried out over time alongside different approaches at making screens off-limits during mealtime - all items that could bring interesting insight into our relationship with technology devices when looking at screentime fluctuations before and after our mediations become part of our daily routine\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Track the impact of daily yoga on overall and category-specific screen time. \n&gt; - Explore the relationship between day of the week and overall or category-specific screen time.\n&gt; - Investigate how long it takes to establish a healthy habit, such as decreased phone usage, by looking at changes in average daily screen time over the period of a month or two months before and after beginning yoga practice, adjusting for weekly period effect\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/taylynners04)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n&gt; - You are free to:\n&gt;      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt;      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt; - You must:\n&gt;      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n&gt;      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n&gt;      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Screen Time Data.csv**\n| Column name               | Description                                                                               |\n|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Date**                  | The date of the data entry.
