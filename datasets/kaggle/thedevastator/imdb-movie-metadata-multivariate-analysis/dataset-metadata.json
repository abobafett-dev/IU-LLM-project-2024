Featuring a comprehensive set of variables that range from budget, revenue, and cast size to title types and genres - it holds the keys for unlocking lucrative insights about your favorite films. This dataset contains an array of information on over 10,000 film titles from 6 different countries (USA, UK, Germany, Canada, India and Japan). Its detailed columns include Movie ID (unique identifier for each film), Title Type (TV Series/Movie/Video), Production Budget & Revenue figures in USD along with a breakdown into Country-specific Currency Units such as EUR or GBP. Additionally, each entry features the Primary Genre Category it was classified under along with secondary Genres if applicable. Finally this collection includes text fields giving insight into plot keywords as well as Cast & Crew credits including names of Actors/Actresses in main roles plus other important personnel working on set such as Directors or Writers. Together all these features create an invaluable resource suitable for detailed analysis aiming to understand movie trends over time \u2013 How budgets compare across nations?

It has a variety of columns which provide valuable insights when attempting to do multivariate analysis on this data. The data is divided into metacritic score (which is a measure of critics ratings), budget (in dollars), revenue (in dollars) and eight other stats related to movies \n&gt;  \n&gt; - Metacritic Score: A metric based on critical reviews ranging from 0 - 100 indicating how well the movie was reviewed by critics.\n&gt; - Budget: Total budget in US dollars for each movie. This can be used to better understand why certain films are successful or not so successful when analyzing against other metrics in the dataset \n&gt; - Revenue: Total revenue earned in US dollars for each movie at Box Office and outside digital downloads/streams & TV airplay etc\u2026 we could use this to calculate revenue per budget for movies as well as success rates of certain genres over others given higher budgets  \n&gt; - Release Date: The release date given in string format mainly used for understanding seasonality effects between various releases in different times throughout the year  e.g summer vs winter releases  \n&gt; 5 .Runtime: Length of time that a film plays for expressed in minutes  could be useful measuring watchability/ engagement potential or correlations with average ticket prices at theatre pricing timeframes(matinees vs evening shows)  \n&gt; \n&gt; 6 Genres : Genres associated with a particular film e.g comedy ,drama , horror etc \u2026 Value information taken from freedb collection created by IMDB,these categories can also help further narrow down what people like and disliked about certain films or companies producing them     \n&gt; \n&gt; 7 Directors : Each directors name usually one director per film which might give us some insight into directing decisions made which have an impact on box-office performance    \n&gt; \n&gt;  8 Writers : Names of writers associated with a particular project same reasoning applies here that making different decisions around who write content reflects audience response   \n&gt; \n&gt;  9 Actors/Actresses : Names of some key actors associate with major roles like leads/support\t takes who worked on stories will give more insight into why viewers preferred them OVER OTHER PROJECTS   THEY MAY HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH along their career paths   \n&gt; \n&gt;  10 Countries apart from USA origin countries are identified Here since many american productions try new approaches keeping an eye out may point us towards effective techniques being implemented abroad that have potential application to American markets\t          ADR\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Creating movie recommendation systems based on user preferences: This dataset can be used to uncover patterns in user movie watching habits and preferences by factoring in multiple variables such as genre, release year, director, cast, popularity/ratings etc., and recommending similar movies accordingly. \n&gt; - Cost vs Profit predictive models: This dataset can be utilized to construct a predictive model that helps film studios identify which genres of movies are more profitable based on factors like budget size, popularity ratings and award nominations. The model would help studio executives better allocate their resources for more profitable films in a cost effective way. \n&gt; - Improving film production techniques via Analytics : Patterns derived from this dataset can also be used to help filmmakers understand what works best for audiences and how to optimally structure their productions so that it maximizes profits for the studio (e.g Learning what elements should be included in the first 10 minutes of a film when capturing viewers\u2019 attention)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/aitmlouk)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit [Addi Ait-Mlouk](https://data.world/aitmlouk).\n\n",
