It includes 30 features such as radius, texture, area, compactness and concavity that were generated from the a digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) of the mass to generate characteristics of the cell nuclei present in each case. It also includes outcomes such as recurrence and nonrecurrence and also time-to-recurrence information for those cases that relapse.\n&gt; \n&gt; This breaking dataset was created by some leading minds in medical science; Dr William H. Wolberg at the University Of Wisconsin Clinical Sciences Center alongside W. Nick Street at the university's Computer Sciences Dept., and Olvi L Mangasarian also based there - all credited with creating various decision tree construction systems using linear programming models to accurately predict disease recurrences within an incredibly short time frame. \n&gt; \n&gt; The data is freely available through UW CS ftp server or on Kaggle's website making use easier than ever before - giving all researchers access up-to-date information regarding breast cancer prognosis and diagnosis via images taken from FNA tests conducted on masses in diagnosed patients' bodies - allowing each participant instantaneous access to a powerful set of features versus outcomes within both recurrent and nonrecurrent situations.. Moreover papers such as 'An inductive learning approach to prognostic prediction.' by WN street et al have utilized this database extensively mapping out how Artificial Neural Networks can be used for predictive tasks with noteworthy success! Armed with these tested ideas consequently anyone has access level ground in understanding how decisions are made as it relates to predicting breast cancer outcome effectively utilizing this dataset helping us better understand how a predictive model can significantly improve patient care processes!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset is designed to improve the prognostics of breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. The data consists of a time series of patient symptoms and various medical parameters, such as tumor size and malignancy, that can be used by programmatic algorithms to predict diagnosis and prognosis outcomes. Here are some steps on how to use this dataset: \n&gt; \n&gt; - Pre-process and clean the data: Since the dataset contains incomplete or missing values across various parameters, it is important to clean and pre-process the data before attempting any machine learning algorithm (MLA). This includes sorting out what type of values need imputation, standardizing features for better performance, encoding categorical variables for MLAs, and normalizing numerical values for accuracy. \n&gt; \n&gt; - Choose an appropriate MLA: Depending on your exact goal with this data set - for example if you wanted reliable classification results or weighted predictions based on factors - there are a variety of MLAs from which you may select; examples include logistic regression classifiers, least squares support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, nonsmooth optimization algorithms like A-Optimality or global optimization methods such as Extract M-of-N rule sets from trained neural nets..  It would be wise to read up on each algorithm in order to determine which one most appropriately meets your needs before starting experimentation with the dataset itself.  \n&gt; - Train the model using your selected MLA: Once you have identified an MLA that fits your desired result outcome best \u2013 or if you decide on experimenting with multiple approaches \u2013it\u2019s time turn back towards the data itself in order run experiments actually examine outcomes based upon training models built upon it through cross validation methods such as k-fold splitting..  Then test these trained models against validation datasets taken from specified subsets within the original larger data set structure held by Kaggle in order get general outputs results determining performance rates over various conditions presented by parameter combinations relevant when predicting breast cancer diagnostic &/or prognostic outcomes ..   Establishing any trends revealed during these experiments will help inform future model selections during training process associated implementing an effective predictive solution fitting specific user requirements especially where particular MLA are not tailored handle purpose generally falling outside scope designing said model so guaranteeing accuracy at specific task addressed like focus more classification than regression analysis instance.\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Building Machine Learning models that learn from the data, using different techniques such as decision trees, logistic regression, artificial neural networks and support vector machines, to accurately classify and predict whether or not a patient will have recurrent breast cancer. \n&gt; - Developing algorithms for feature selection or variable selection to identify the aspects most relevant in predicting recurrence of breast cancer with greater accuracy and precision than existing methods.\n&gt; - Using the data set for studying relationships between different features and time based on statistical analysis to gain insights into risk factors associated with breast cancer recurrence\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/uci)\n&gt; \n \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: unformatted-data.csv**\n\n_____\n\n**File: wpbc.data.csv**\n| Column name   | Description                  |\n|:--------------|:-----------------------------|\n| **119513**    | ID Number (Integer)          |\n| **31**        | Time (Integer)               |\n| **18.02**     | Radius (Float)               |\n| **27.6**      | Texture (Float)              |\n| **117.5**     | Perimeter (Float)            |\n| **1013**      | Area (Float)                 |\n| **0.09489**   | Smoothness (Float)           |\n| **0.1036**    | Compactness (Float)          |\n| **0.1086**    | Concavity (Float)            |\n| **0.07055**   | Concave Points (Float)       |\n| **0.1865**    | Symmetry (Float)             |\n| **0.06333**   | Fractal Dimension (Float)    |\n| **0.6249**    | Radius Variance (Float)      |\n| **1.89**      | Texture Variance (Float)     |\n| **3.972**     | Perimeter Variance (Float)   |\n| **71.55**     | Area Variance (Float)        |\n| **0.004433**  | Smoothness Variance (Float)  |\n| **0.01421**   | Compactness Variance (Float) |\n| **0.03233**   | Concavity Variance (Float)   |\n\n_____\n\n**File: breast-cancer-wisconsin.data.csv**\n| Column name   | Description                        |\n|:--------------|:-----------------------------------|\n| **1000025**   | Patient ID (Integer)               |\n| **1.1**       | Uniformity of Cell Shape (Integer) |\n| **1.2**       | Marginal Adhesion (Integer)        |\n| **1.3**       | Bare Nuclei (Integer)              |\n| **1.4**       | Normal Nucleoli (Integer)          |\n| **1.5**       | Mitoses (Integer)                  |\n| **2.1**       | Class (Integer)                    |\n\n_____\n\n**File: wdbc.data.csv**\n| Column name   | Description                     |\n|:--------------|:--------------------------------|\n| **842302**    | ID Number (Integer)             |\n| **M**         | Outcome (String)                |\n| **17.99**     | Radius (Float)                  |\n| **10.38**     | Texture (Float)                 |\n| **122.8**     | Perimeter (Float)               |\n| **1001**      | Area (Float)                    |\n| **0.1184**    | Smoothness (Float)              |\n| **0.2776**    | Compactness (Float)             |\n| **0.3001**    | Concavity (Float)               |\n| **0.1471**    | Concave Points (Float)          |\n| **0.2419**    | Symmetry (Float)                |\n| **0.07871**   | Fractal Dimension (Float)       |\n| **1.095**     | Radius Variance (Float)         |\n| **0.9053**    | Texture Variance (Float)        |\n| **8.589**     | Perimeter Variance (Float)      |\n| **153.4**     | Area Variance (Float)           |\n| **0.006399**  | Smoothness Variance (Float)     |\n| **0.04904**   | Compactness Variance (Float)    |\n| **0.05373**   | Concavity Variance (Float)      |\n| **0.01587**   | Concave Points Variance (Float) |\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit [UCI](https://data.world/uci).\n\n",
