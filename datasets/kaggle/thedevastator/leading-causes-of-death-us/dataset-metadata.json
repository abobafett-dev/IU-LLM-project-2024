This data sheds light on how mortality in the US has changed over time among these categories. Accounting for everything from heart disease to cancer to suicide, this insight can be used by health researchers and policy makers to gain a better understanding of disparities in healthcare and deaths across different groups. Whether studying questions related to public health or more targeted population issues such as gender biases in death rates, this dataset provides an important resource for anyone interested in examining mortality across demographic lines\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset can be used to explore some of the leading causes of death in the United States from 1980 to 2009, broken down by sex, race, and Hispanic origin. This data can be used to better understand mortality trends and risk factors associated with different populations in America. \n> \n> By using this dataset you can compare and contrast mortality rates across different gender, racial, and ethnic groups during this time period. You can also compare different causes of death within these demographic categories to see if there are any patterns over time or notable differences between groups.  \n> \n> You could even use this data to track changes across population groups as a whole or look at details for specific years or types of causes of death in particular groups. With this information one may gain insight into health disparities across population segments in America\u2014 aiding advocates for social change & public policy shifts toward improved health outcomes for all Americans!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Analyzing regional or state-level differences in mortality rates over time. \n> - Examining the beahvioral factors or risk factors associated with each cause of death for different genders and populations. \n> - Examining the prevalence of each cause of death as a proportion to an overall population trend in different socio-economic categories such as race or income level\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/health)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n> - You are free to:\n>      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n>      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n> - You must:\n>      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n>      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n>      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Selected_Trend_Table_from_Health__United_States__2011._Leading_causes_of_death_and_numbers_of_deaths__by_sex__race__and_Hispanic_origin__United_States__1980_and_2009.csv**\n| Column name        | Description                                                                                              |\n|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Group**          | The group of people the cause of death applies to (e.g. men, women, whites, blacks, hispanics).
