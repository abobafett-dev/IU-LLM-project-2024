This dataset includes two key indicators: NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBER (NINo) REGISTRATIONS and NEW MIGRANT GP REGISTRATIONS. NINo registrations measure the number of registrations of National Insurance Numbers to foreign nationals living in the UK, while migrant GP registrations provide a measure of new migrants registering with a general practitioner in the UK. This data provides invaluable information to help analyze new migration trends and understand how they impact different aspects of life within the United Kingdom. \n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset provides information on the long-term international migration to the UK. It contains data on two indicators, National Insurance Numbers registrations and new migrant GP registrations. It gives insights into how many people have moved to the UK from other countries as well as how they are settling down in terms of health care. \n&gt;\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyzing the community health needs of newly arrived migrants by using the New Migrant GP Registrations to identify areas with higher concentrations of new immigrants and provide resources accordingly. \n&gt; - Examining trends in National Insurance Number (NINo) registrations for overseas nationals to determine changes in foreign migration over time. \n&gt; - Establishing policies and procedures for governments seeking to track individuals entering or leaving their countries by cross-referencing both NINo registration data, as well as New Migrant GP Registration data, from different countries over a certain period\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/dataworldadmin)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
