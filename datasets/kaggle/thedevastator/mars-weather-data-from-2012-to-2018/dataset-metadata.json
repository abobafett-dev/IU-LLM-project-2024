It captures the weather conditions on Mars at Gale Crater from Sol 1 to Sol 1895. This data was measured by and transmitted from the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) on-board the Curiosity Rover. All environmental magnitudes provided are obtained from values reported back to Earth and may be impacted by Curiosity's position, temperature, orientation, shade or dust depositions.\n&gt;   \n&gt; This folder also includes weather information compiled at UTC Midnight for 1,000 cities around the world - ranging from capital cities of every country to states within the U.S. This data is Powered by Dark Sky with each row containing latitude/longitude coordinates alongside a 3-day window of forecasted/predicted regions for each respective city/state. \n&gt;   \n&gt; Both files come with a disclaimer as outlined above and must include attribution as Powered by Dark Sky should you use this dataset for further analysis purposes - released under an MIT License agreement!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ## Overview \n&gt; This dataset contains weather conditions from Sol 1 to Sol 1895.

It should come with a **Data Disclaimer** that any other use is discouraged due it\u2019s intended use for outreach purposes only.  \n&gt; The information in this file is outlined in different columns - there are 14 columns listed: `id`, `terrestrial_date`, `sol`, `ls`, `month`,`min_temp`, `max_temp`,`pressure` ,`wind_speed` ,`atmo_opacity`. As well as specific descriptions provided that contain more detail as what each column contains(For example: variable called \u201cmin_temp\u201d includes temperatures that were observed lower than average during a single Martian day). Additionally, there are coordinates included within each row - latitude and longitude which provides physical locations where these measurements were taken at. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Creating predictive models to forecast the Martian climate and atmospheric pressure in the future.\n&gt; - Comparing Earth cities\u2019 weather data with those collected on Mars over time to see if there are any common patterns or trends.\n&gt; - Developing an interactive tool that allows users to explore both Earth and Martian weather conditions in real-time by seeing differences between two global maps of current weather conditions \u2014 one for Earth and one for Mars\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/dataworldadmin)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: marsWeather.csv**\n| Column name          | Description                                                           |\n|:---------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **terrestrial_date** | The date on Earth when the data was collected.
