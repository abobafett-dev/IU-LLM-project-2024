The data was collected from 410 mothers in postpartum period, and their infants aged between 3-12 months old. A wide range of variables was included such as participant number, information on parental type and age, infant gestation week, marital status, educational level and type of pregnancy. Additionally, measures of various maternal mental health symptoms ( including depression, anxiety and childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder) as well as factors affecting infant sleep (including sex of the infant, perception about temperament and method for putting children to bed) were recorded. \n&gt; \n&gt; By analysing this dataset with a variety of parenting and psychological methods it is possible to investigate how distinct influences of maternal mental health difficulties shape infants\u2019 sleep patterns depending on different moderatingfactors such as maternal educational level or ageof the child. In addition mediating factors like perception about Infant temperament or methodfor falling asleep should also be takeninto account in order to fully understand  howmental health issues may affect a newborn'ssleep and development process. With its helpwe can gain valuable insights that can inform government policies or interventions aimed atimproving families' physical healthandsocial wellbeing\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset is primarily useful for researchers and policy makers who wish to study the influence of maternal mental health difficulties on infant sleep during the first year postpartum. While taking into consideration moderating and mediating factors, this dataset provides information on sociodemographic characteristics (such as maternal age, marital status, educational level etc.), maternal mental health symptoms (such as CB-PTSD, depression and anxiety), infant sleep and temperament. \n&gt; \n&gt; The following are steps to help you effectively use this dataset: \n&gt; - Download the Dataset_maternal_mental_health_infant_sleep.csv file in your preferred format which can be .csv or .zip format from Kaggle website  \n&gt; - Read through all columns in the Dataset with its formats e.g gender of baby1 is a column with string values(male/female).  \n&gt; - Explore each column using statistical measures like mean, median etc where applicable such as age of mother at inclusion in the study (Age)  \n&gt; 4 Create research relevant graphs for better understanding of data for example scatter-plot between Age and CBTS scores   \n&gt; 5 Subset the sheet based on variables such as gender or marital status based on research interest   \n&gt; 6 Perform regression analysis if required by looking at any particular variable vs multiple other variables specifically maternal mental health parameters vs type of parenting or socio- demographic features\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Investigating whether there are different levels of maternal mental health symptoms in relation to infant age, sex, and type of delivery.\n&gt; - Examining the associations between maternal mental health symptoms and infant sleeping patterns by taking into account sociodemographic factors such as marital status and education level. \n&gt; - Analyzing how parenting strategies impact the relationship between maternal mental health difficulties and infant sleep behaviors over time\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/5070945#.Y8Oq4NJBwUE)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
