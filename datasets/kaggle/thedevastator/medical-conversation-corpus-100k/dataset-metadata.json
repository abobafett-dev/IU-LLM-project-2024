With samples collected from human conversations, this dataset contains a variety of options and suggestions to assist in creating useful language models. From prescribed medications to home remedies such as yoga exercises, breathing exercises, and natural remedies\u2014this collection has it all! Only if you trust the language model you build with the right data can you use it to make decisions that matter in real life. This data is sure to give your project the boost it needs with legitimate information power-packed into every sample!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n>  \n> - Download the dataset.
