It compiles important demographic information as well as self-reported data and results from psychological tests to give a comprehensive picture of the mental states of students in the medical field. Through this research, we hope to gain a better understanding of how being a medical student can affect health and wellbeing. By looking at the individual factors that may contribute to different outcomes, we can work towards improving educational systems for the benefit of both students and their eventual patients\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset contains information on the mental health, empathy and burnout of medical students in Switzerland. It includes data about demographic factors such as age, sex and language spoken as well as internal measures such as job satisfaction, psychological distress, education grades, self-reported health status and empathy rating scales. The objective of this dataset is to gain insight into the wellbeing of medical students in order to promote better policies by understanding relationships between these variables.
