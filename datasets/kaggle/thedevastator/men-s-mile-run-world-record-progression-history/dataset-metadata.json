It allows us to look back in history and get a comprehensive overview of how this track event has progressed over time. Analyzing this information can help us understand how training and technology have improved the event over the years; as well as study different athletes' performances and learn how some athletes have pushed beyond their limits or fell short. This valuable resource is an essential source for anyone intrigued by the cutting edge achievements in men's mile running world records. Discovering powerful insights from this dataset can allow us to gain perspective into not only our own personal goals but also uncover ideas on how we could continue pushing our physical boundaries by watching past successes.

We will focus on analyzing specific fields such as date, athlete name & nationality, time taken for completion and auto status by using statistical methods and graphical displays of data. \n> \n> In order to use this data effectively it is important that you understand what each field measures: \n> \u2022    Time: The amount of time it took for an athlete to finish a race - measured in minutes  \t\tand seconds (example: 3:54).  \n> \u2022    Auto: Whether or not a pacemaker was used during a specific race (example ; yes/no).  \n> \u2022    Athlete Name & Nationality: The name and nationality associated with an athlete who set \\\\record(example; Usain Bolt  - Jamaica).  \n> \u2022    Date : Year representing when a specific record was set by an individual\\( example-2021 ).  \t\t  \u2022Venue : Location at which the record is set.(example; London Olympic Stadium )    \n> \n> \n> \n> Now that you understand which fields measure what let\u2019s discuss various ways that you can use these datasets features. Analyzing trends in historical sporting performances has long been utilized as means for understanding changes brought about by new training methods/technologies etc., over time . This can be done with our dataset by using basic statistical displays like bar graphs & average analysis or more advanced methods such as regression analysis or even Bayesian approaches etc..The first thing anyone interested should do when dealing with this sort of data is inspect any wacky outliers before beginning more rigorous analysis; if one discovers any potential unreasonable values it would be best to discard them before building after models or readings based off them (this sort of elimination is common practice).After cleaning your work space let\u2019s move onto building interactive visual display through graphics ,plotting different columns against one another e.g., \u2013 plotting `time` against `date` allows us see changes overtime from 1861 until now . Additionally plotting `time` vs `Auto` allows us see any\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Comparing individual athletes and identifying those who have consistently pushed the event to higher levels of performance.\n> - Analyzing national trends related to improvement in track records over time, based on differences in training and technology.\n> - Creating a heatmap to visualize the progression of track records around the world and locate regions with a particularly strong historical performance in this event\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/dataremixed)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n> - You are free to:\n>      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n>      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n> - You must:\n>      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n>      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n>      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Men's Mile Run Record Progression.csv**\n| Column name     | Description                                                |\n|:----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Time**        | The time it took the athlete to complete the race.
