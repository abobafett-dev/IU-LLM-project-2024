Mental health is an issue that affects all people of all ages, genders and walks of life. The prevalence of these issues within the tech industry\u2013one that places hard demands on those who work in it\u2013is no exception. By analyzing this dataset, we can better understand how prevalent mental health issues are among those who work in the tech sector.\u2013and what kinds of resources they rely upon to find help\u2013so that more can be done to create a healthier working environment for all. \n> \n> This dataset tracks key measures such as age, gender and country to determine overall prevalence, along with responses surrounding employee access to care options; whether mental health or physical illness are being taken as seriously by employers; whether or not anonymity is protected with regards to seeking help; and how coworkers may perceive those struggling with mental illness issues such as depression or anxiety. With an ever-evolving landscape due to new technology advancing faster than ever before \u2013 these statistics have never been more important for us to analyze if we hope remain true promoters of a healthy world inside and outside our office walls\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> In this dataset you will find data on age, gender, country, and state of survey respondents in addition to numerous questions that assess an individual's mental state including: self-employment status, family history of mental illness, treatment status and access or lack thereof; how their mental health condition affects their work; number of employees at the company they work for; remote work status; tech company status; benefit information from employers such as mental health benefits and wellness program availability; anonymity protection if seeking treatment resources for substance abuse or mental health issues ; ease (or difficulty) for medical leave for a mental health condition ; whether discussing physical or medical matters with employers have negative consequences. You will also find comments from survey participants. \n> \n> To use this dataset effectively: \n> - Clean the data by removing invalid responses/duplicates/missing values - you can do this with basic Pandas commands like .dropna() , .drop_duplicates(), .replace(). \n> - Utilize descriptive statistics such as mean and median to draw general conclusions about patterns of responses - you can do this with Pandas tools such as .groupby() and .describe(). \n> - Run various types analyses such as mean comparisons on different kinds of variables(age vs gender), correlations between different features etc using appropriate statistical methods - use commands like Statsmodels' OLS models (.smf) , calculate z-scores , run hypothesis tests etc depending on what analysis is needed. Make sure you are aware any underlying assumptions your analysis requires beforehand !  \n> - Visualize your results with plotting libraries like Matplotlib/Seaborn to easily interpret these findings! Use boxplots/histograms/heatmaps where appropriate depending on your question !\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Using the results of this survey, you could develop targeted outreach campaigns directed at underrepresented groups that answer \u201cNo\u201d to questions about their employers providing resources for mental health or discussing it as part of wellness programs. \n> - Analyzing the employee characteristics (e.g., age and gender) of those who reported negative consequences from discussing their mental health in the workplace could inform employer policies to support individuals with mental health conditions and reduce stigma and discrimination in the workplace. \n> - Correlating responses to questions about remote work, leave policies, and anonymity with whether or not individuals have sought treatment for a mental health condition may provide insight into which types of workplace resources are most beneficial for supporting employees dealing with these issues\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/quanticdata)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n> - You are free to:\n>      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n>      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n> - You must:\n>      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n>      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n>      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: survey.csv**\n| Column name                   | Description                                                                                                                  |\n|:------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Timestamp**                 | Date and time of survey submission.
