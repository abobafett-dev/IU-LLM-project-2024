The data contained within the Mental Health Services Data Set (MHSDS) - Children & Young People covers a variety of different categories during a given reporting period, including primary level details, secondary level descriptions, number of open referrals for children's and young people's mental health services at the end of the reporting period, as well as number of first attended contacts for referrals open in the reporting period aged 0-18. It also provides insight into how many people are in contact with mental health services aged 0 to 18 at the time of reporting, how many referrals starting during this time were self-refreshers and more. This dataset includes valuable information that is necessary to better track and understand trends in order to provide more effective care\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> This guide will provide you with an overview of the data contained in this dataset as well as information on how to effectively use it for your own research or personal purposes.

The data contained within the Mental Health Services Data Set (MHSDS) - Children & Young People covers a variety of different categories during a given reporting period, including primary level details, secondary level descriptions, number of open referrals for children's and young people's mental health services at the end of the reporting period, as well as number of first attended contacts for referrals open in the reporting period aged 0-18. It also provides insight into how many people are in contact with mental health services aged 0 to 18 at the time of reporting, how many referrals starting during this time were self-refreshers and more. This dataset includes valuable information that is necessary to better track and understand trends in order to provide more effective care\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> This guide will provide you with an overview of the data contained in this dataset as well as information on how to effectively use it for your own research or personal purposes.
