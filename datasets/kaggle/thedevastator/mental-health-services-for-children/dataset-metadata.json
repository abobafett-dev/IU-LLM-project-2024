The data includes all primary and secondary levels of care, as well as breakdowns by age group. Information is provided on the number of people in contact with mental health services; open ward stays; open referrals; referrals starting in reporting period; attended contacts; indirect activity; discharged from referral; missed care contacts by DNA reasons and more. With these statistics, analysts may be able to better understand the scope of mental health service usage across different age groups in England and make valuable conclusions about best practices for helping children & young people receive proper care\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> This guide provides information on how to use this dataset effectively. \n> \n> ##### Understanding the Columns: \n> Each row represents data from a specific month within a reporting period. The first thing to do is to find out what each column represents - this is explained by their titles and descriptions included at the beginning of this dataset. Note that there are primary level columns (e.g., Reporting Period, Breakdown) which provide overall context while secondary level columns (e.g., CYP01 People in contact with children and young peoples' mentally health service\u2026) provide more detail on specific indicators of interest related to that primary level column value pair (i.e., Reporting Period X).  \n> \n>  \n> ##### Exploring Data Variables: \n> The next step is exploring which data variables could potentially be helpful when analyzing initiatives/programs related to mental health care for children & youth in England or developing policies related to them \u2013 look through all columns included here for ones you think would be most helpful such as \u2018CYP21 \u2013 Open ward stays...\u2019 or \u2018MHS07a - People with an open hospital spell\u2026\u2019 and note down those that have been considered necessary/relevant based on your particular situation/needs before further analyzing using software packages like Excel or SPSS etc..\n> \n>   \t  \t          \t       \t  \n> ##### Analyzing Data Values: \t    \t    \t    \t          \t         \n> Now comes the time for analyzing individual values provided under each respective column \u2013 take one single numerical data element such as \u2018CYP02 \u2013 People\u2026 CPA end RP\u2019 & run through it all looking at trends over time, averages across different sections by performing calculations via software packages available like tables provided above based upon sorted hierarchies needed.. Then you can then start looking into making meaningful correlations between different pieces of information given herein by cross-referencing contexts against each other resulting if any noticeable patterns found significant enough will make informative decisions towards policy implementations & program improvement opportunities both directly concerned\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Using this dataset to identify key trends in mental health services usage among children and young people in England, such as the number of open ward stays and referrals received. \n> - Using the information to develop targeted solutions on areas of need identified from the data by geographical area or age group, i.e creating campaigns or programs specifically targeting specific groups at a higher risk of experiencing mental health difficulties or engaging with specialist services. \n> - Tracking how well these initiatives are working over time by monitoring relevant metrics such as attendance at appointments, open referrals etc to evaluate their effectiveness in improving access and engagement with mental health services for those most in need\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/dataworldadmin)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n> - You are free to:\n>      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n>      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n> - You must:\n>      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n>      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n>      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: mhsds-monthly-cyp-data-file-feb-fin-2017-1.csv**\n| Column name                                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                              |\n|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **REPORTING_PERIOD**                                                                                         | The period of time covered by the report (in YYYY-MM format).

The data includes all primary and secondary levels of care, as well as breakdowns by age group. Information is provided on the number of people in contact with mental health services; open ward stays; open referrals; referrals starting in reporting period; attended contacts; indirect activity; discharged from referral; missed care contacts by DNA reasons and more. With these statistics, analysts may be able to better understand the scope of mental health service usage across different age groups in England and make valuable conclusions about best practices for helping children & young people receive proper care\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> This guide provides information on how to use this dataset effectively. \n> \n> ##### Understanding the Columns: \n> Each row represents data from a specific month within a reporting period. The first thing to do is to find out what each column represents - this is explained by their titles and descriptions included at the beginning of this dataset. Note that there are primary level columns (e.g., Reporting Period, Breakdown) which provide overall context while secondary level columns (e.g., CYP01 People in contact with children and young peoples' mentally health service\u2026) provide more detail on specific indicators of interest related to that primary level column value pair (i.e., Reporting Period X).  \n> \n>  \n> ##### Exploring Data Variables: \n> The next step is exploring which data variables could potentially be helpful when analyzing initiatives/programs related to mental health care for children & youth in England or developing policies related to them \u2013 look through all columns included here for ones you think would be most helpful such as \u2018CYP21 \u2013 Open ward stays...\u2019 or \u2018MHS07a - People with an open hospital spell\u2026\u2019 and note down those that have been considered necessary/relevant based on your particular situation/needs before further analyzing using software packages like Excel or SPSS etc..\n> \n>   \t  \t          \t       \t  \n> ##### Analyzing Data Values: \t    \t    \t    \t          \t         \n> Now comes the time for analyzing individual values provided under each respective column \u2013 take one single numerical data element such as \u2018CYP02 \u2013 People\u2026 CPA end RP\u2019 & run through it all looking at trends over time, averages across different sections by performing calculations via software packages available like tables provided above based upon sorted hierarchies needed.. Then you can then start looking into making meaningful correlations between different pieces of information given herein by cross-referencing contexts against each other resulting if any noticeable patterns found significant enough will make informative decisions towards policy implementations & program improvement opportunities both directly concerned\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Using this dataset to identify key trends in mental health services usage among children and young people in England, such as the number of open ward stays and referrals received. \n> - Using the information to develop targeted solutions on areas of need identified from the data by geographical area or age group, i.e creating campaigns or programs specifically targeting specific groups at a higher risk of experiencing mental health difficulties or engaging with specialist services. \n> - Tracking how well these initiatives are working over time by monitoring relevant metrics such as attendance at appointments, open referrals etc to evaluate their effectiveness in improving access and engagement with mental health services for those most in need\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/dataworldadmin)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n> - You are free to:\n>      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n>      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n> - You must:\n>      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n>      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n>      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: mhsds-monthly-cyp-data-file-feb-fin-2017-1.csv**\n| Column name                                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                              |\n|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **REPORTING_PERIOD**                                                                                         | The period of time covered by the report (in YYYY-MM format).
