The data consists of text from posts extracted from a variety of subreddits, as well as over 256 features that may provide insight into the psychological and linguistic characteristics within these conversations.\n> \n> These included indicators measure such things as Automated Readability Index, Coleman-Liau Index, Flesch Reading Ease, Gunning Fog Index and Lix scores; Wiener Sachtextformel calculations; TF-IDF analyses related to key topics like abuse, alcohol use, anxiety, depression symptoms, family matters and more. Furthermore, values are also provided for metrics like words and syllables per sentence; total characters present in each post; total phrases or sentences contained per submission; numbers of long/monosyllable/polysyllable words used throughout each contribution. \n> \n> Sentiment analysis is another useful measurement made available within this dataset - values can be graphed against aspects such as negativity or neutrality versus positivity across all posts discussing various ideas related to economic stressors or isolation experiences - all alongside scores related to specific issues like substance use frequency or gun control debates.  Additionally this dataset offers valuable metrics concerning punctuation tendencies encountered in these types of conversations - often associated with syntax brought forward by personal pronouns in the first person (I); second person (you) ; third person (him/her/they).

The data consists of text from posts, as well as over 256 different indicators of psychological and linguistic features. \n> \n> To get started, you will need to set up your own local environment with the necessary packages for running the dataset.

This dataset contains features such as Automated Readability Index (ARI), Coleman-Liau Index (CLI), Flesch Reading Ease (FREEDOM), Gunning Fog Index (GFI), Lix, Wiener Sachtextformel, sentiment scores such as sentiment negative (SENT_NEG) and sentiment compound (SENT_COMPOUND).
