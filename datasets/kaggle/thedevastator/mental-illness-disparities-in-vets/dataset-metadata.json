Through this data we can learn about the sociodemographics, utilization patterns and rates of diagnosed health conditions for vulnerable veterans across VA facilities. This valuable information can inform how VA healthcare is managed and how stakeholders are able to set meaningful goals for improving care for these special populations. By equipping ourselves with understanding of mental illness diagnosis trends among vulnerable veteran population, we can continue our quest to ensure that all veterans in need get quality care when they need it\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> ##  Exploring the dataset\n> It is important to understand each variable before interpreting the data more closely so let's take a closer look at each variable: \n> - **Vulnerable_population** - This variable describes which particular demographic group is being studied; e.g., gender or race/ethnicity.  \n> - **Section** - This variable indicates which section of the report that the data comes from; e.g., 1 or 2. \n> - **Long_title** - This variable contains information regarding the full title of a given study item as found within the report itself; e.g., Mental illness diagnoses (K-12).\u201d   \n> - **Short_title** - This variable offers a shortened version of a study item\u2019s title for easy referencing later on; e.g.,M-I diagnoses. \t\t\t  \t  \t  \t  \t  \t    * **Group** -This variable describes what population group (i.e., veterans) is being studied specifically over time within an identified vulnerable population group per section and within overall categories specified by long titles and short titles; e\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Analyzing mental illness disparities among different vulnerable veteran groups to inform target outreach programs for care and resources.\n> - Using the dataset to track rates of diagnosied mental illnesses by section, group and subgroup in order to assess how factors such as age, sex and other demographics may play a role in mental health disparities. \n> - Utilizing comparative rate differences between groups to identify potential gaps in care or access to diagnostics or treatments for veterans with mental illness\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/datagov-us)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
