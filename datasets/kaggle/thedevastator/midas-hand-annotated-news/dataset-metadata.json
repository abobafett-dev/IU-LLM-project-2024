Featuring three formats TXT, CSV and JSON file this resource stimulates groundbreaking research in data science and machine learning approaches. \n> \n> The source material consists of 2020 news articles provided in TXT format for convenient use of the reader. Each article is enriched by extensive manual annotation which records up to 10 MeSH headings contained within the piece. Furthermore, the generated JSON file supports evaluation tools for classifier accuracy rating. \n> \n> The dataset columns consist of x (Article ID - Integer), y (Article Text - String), z[0] (MeSH Heading 1 - String), z[1] (MeSH Heading 2 - String) through z[8] (MeSH Heading 9 - String). Unlock powerful insights with this unique resource and make an impact on knowledge discovery today!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> For the TXT format, it is the source of all news articles from each of the dataset\u2019s physician-defined topics. This is great for getting an overview glance at all articles with regards to each topic without needing any added information. \n> \n> The CSV file contains hand-annotation of news articles on up to 10 medical subject headings (MeSH), so it is an excellent resource if you are looking to quickly extract summaries and insights into different health topics. It also helps researchers compare how multiple topics intersect in the same article over time by displaying the MeSH headings associated with each article in a convenient table view. The columns contained in this csv include: Article ID; Article Text; MeSH Heading 1 through 9; and Topic Label Used For Evaluation On Test Set, where each column contains necessary information supporting research objectives related to health-related diseases or conditions worldwide. \n> \n> Finally, the JSON file provides input for evaluation purposes when using NLP predictive modeling techniques such as deep learning models to classify new articles from media related sources based on both content and labels associated with them through annotation by healthcare experts1 . The columns contained in this json include: headers which contain information about key article components corresponding values that provide additional insights about their contents - such as domains (excludes/includes sentiment analysis for example); subject heading keys/values relevant keywords/phrases used in contextually related text bodies & sections titles/headlines within an article; meta data structure & entities location identifiers - i\u200b ncluding geographical details regarding where physical locations featured have been cited accurately2 . Ultimately this offers researchers valuable support when developing effective machine learning models which could later be implemented into day-to-day workflows within healthcare platforms Xeonphi / AI \u200b etc..\u200b \n>  \n> \n>  By combining these formats together you can gain greater insight into complex areas relating not only diseases but also many other factors influencing people\u2019s physical & mental wellbeing today3\u200b\u200b\u200b .
