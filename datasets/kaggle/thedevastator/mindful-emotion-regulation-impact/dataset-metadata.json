The study aimed to examine whether the mindful detachment from negative emotions can lead to better emotion regulation. Data was contents responses collected through questionnaires administered before and after the intervention. It includes self-reported emotional states, as well as detachment from challenging emotion states and related behaviors which will help us understand how people respond when exposed to such techniques in order to be able to make more informed decisions about approaches that can be used for someone who experiences chronic or acute distressful episodes. The underlying connection between our emotions, thoughts and behavior is an important aspect since they are all interdependent and together they play a crucial role which was the focus on this study\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; - Understand the variables: Before using the dataset, it is important to get an understanding of the different columns and variables that are included.
