  "descriptionNullable": "_____\n# Movie Reviews Word2Vec Embeddings Dataset\n### Capturing Semantics in Textual Reviews\nBy Jared Fernandez [[source]](https://data.world/jaredfern)\n_____\n\n### About this dataset\n&gt; This dataset contains a collection of Word2Vec embeddings for nearly 12,000 reviews from movies and other films. These embeddings allow the reviews to be represented in a meaningful way, providing insight into topics and trends present in the reviews. By utilizing this source of data, researchers can gain better understanding of language patterns that appear across various types of movie reviews. Additionally, models with these embeddings can be used to help create/improve models for sentiment analysis and other natural language processing tasks. Each row includes the reviewer's unique ID along with their review text and related word2vec embedding representing textual relationships found therein\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; How to Use this Dataset:\n&gt; \n&gt; - Download the dataset \u2018Movie Reviews Word2Vec Embeddings\u2019 from Kaggle. \n&gt; - This dataset contains an embedding type of word2vec, which is a type of neural network that creates high-dimensional vector representations of words based on their context in a training corpus. \n&gt; - Before making use of these embeddings, it\u2019s important to understand what they are representing and how you can match them with other datasets for analysis purposes. The word2vec embeddings contain two columns \u2013 word (the specific word), and vec (the vector representation associated with that particular word).  \n&gt; - To leverage the data from this text corpus effectively, it is important to first extract meaningful information out of them such as sentiment ratings or determining various topics that appears more frequently in movie reviews etc.. Sorting through millions of reviews will require automated processing \u2013 either by leveraging machine learning algorithms or using natural language processing to determine sentiment polarities and extracting relevant keywords/topics for each review.   \n&gt; - You can also use the pre-processed Word Vectors (embeddings) along with supervised or unsupervised approaches available like Logistic Regression, BERT models etc.. to create features such as sentiment scoring or topic modelling - classifying texts into distinct categories etc.. That may be useful while doing some predictive analysis such as predicting movie ratings based on user reviews etc..  \n&gt; \n&gt; 6 Once you have made use of the pre-processed data from this dataset, you can extend your model's performance further by having better understanding about how those words relate one another using the vectors derived from thems (i.e., Cosine Similarity measurement) which shows relatedness between words thus providing additional insights about relationships among different text fragments or paragraphs in documents eventually helping your model understand better contextual relationships while performing analytics tasks on text corpora involving movie reviews data!\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Automatically clustering movies with similar sentiment and themes. \n&gt; - Automatically generating movie plot summaries based on sentiment analysis of reviews. \n&gt; - Developing a movie recommendation system based on users\u2019 preference in different genres or topics related to the movie in question\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/jaredfern)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n&gt; - You are free to:\n&gt;      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt;      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt; - You must:\n&gt;      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n&gt;      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n&gt;      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit [Jared Fernandez](https://data.world/jaredfern).\n\n",
