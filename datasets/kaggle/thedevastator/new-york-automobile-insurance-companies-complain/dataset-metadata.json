The data is presented in the form of NAIC, company name, ratios, numbers of upheld complaints, question of fact complaints, not upheld complaints and total premiums written (in millions). Ratings are generated by the NY State Department of Financial Services with insurers that have fewer complaints per million dollars being ranked higher on the list. Insights acquired from this valuable data can be used to help identify potential areas for improvement and ensure motorists are paying fair rates for auto insurance coverage.

The data was compiled by the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) and sourced from a variety of sources including the NAIC. The information provided is intended for researchers interested in comparative analysis of automobile insurance complaint rankings over time.\n&gt; \n&gt; To get the most out of this dataset, we recommend starting with an overview of the major indicators presented:  \n&gt; - Ratio: This is calculated as the number of upheld consumer complaints against an insurance company divided by its total premiums written during that period. A high ratio indicates a higher rate of customer dissatisfaction as expressed through formal complaint filing relative to it's total amount of business done during that time period. \n&gt; - Upheld Complaints: This represents the number or complaints filed against an auto insurance provider which were ultimately resolved in favor (or partially in favor with some minor restitution on behalf or the insurer)  to that particular complainant upon examination by DFS staff. \n&gt; \n&gt;  - Not Upheld Complaints: These are formal grievances made against an insurer which upon further review make no resolution to any party; these are usually defined as case being closed without merit but could also include instances where duty was fulfilled per liable contract agreement but dissatisfaction exists nonetheless within one or both parties involved).  \n&gt; \n&gt;  - Total Complaints/Premiums Written (in Millions): These two metrics should help provide a scope to any research being performed using this data set regarding complaint rankings; they should be considered when attempting to make sense patterns noted between several different insurers over this specific timeframe while researching overall trends concerning various types customer dilemmas involving certain providers/industry wide policies which may have gone unresolved at that time .  \n&gt;  - Filing Year : Represents calendar years coinciding with timeline within original parameters outlined at commencement .   \n&gt; \n&gt; Once these figures have been reviewed , we can then conduct individualized further analysis via crosstabulation techniques combine two fields simultaneously -&gt; for example combining yearly spending vs ratio etc.. -&gt; such exploration should facilitate greater understanding how many columns supplied interact bring about overall context surrounding provider's performance ..-&gt;this exercise leads better understanding why insurers scored better than others for consecutive quarters different severities market misconduct hence reason .

So while gathering raw figures under microscope\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Developing an automated algorithm that will use the complaint ratio to predict which claims have a higher likelihood of being upheld by the DFS, in order to help minimize delays in payments or coverage disputes. \n&gt; - Analyzing the premium amounts per filed year to identify potential trends in rates and premiums for insurance companies with high complaint ratios versus those with low complaint ratios.\n&gt; - Using company name and filing year as variables to conduct an interactive customer survey about their experiences with different car insurance companies throughout New York State, in order to identify any potential improvement areas for existing insurers or provide helpful information for prospective policy holders\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/stateofny)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: automobile-insurance-company-complaint-rankings-beginning-2009-1.csv**\n| Column name                        | Description                                                                       |\n|:-----------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **NAIC**                           | National Association of Insurance Commissioners Code (Integer)                    |\n| **Company Name**                   | Name of the automobile insurance company (String)                                 |\n| **Ratio**                          | Ratio of upheld complaints to total complaints (Float)                            |\n| **Upheld Complaints**              | Number of complaints upheld by the Department of Financial Services (Integer)     |\n| **Question of Fact Complaints**    | Number of complaints that require further investigation (Integer)                 |\n| **Not Upheld Complaints**          | Number of complaints not upheld by the Department of Financial Services (Integer) |\n| **Total Complaints**               | Total number of complaints (Integer)                                              |\n| **Premiums Written (in Millions)** | Total premiums written in millions of dollars (Float)                             |\n| **Rank**                           | Rank of the company based on complaint ratio (Integer)                            |\n| **Filing Year**                    | Year in which the complaint data was filed (Integer)                              |\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit [State of New York](https://data.world/stateofny).\n\n",
