Carefully collected and anonymized, the data can be used to further the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models which focus on providing mental health advice and guidance. It consists of a variety of questions which will help train NLP models to provide users with appropriate advice in response to their queries. Whether you're an AI developer interested in building the next wave of mental health applications or a therapist looking for insights into how technology is helping people connect; this dataset provides invaluable support for advancing our understanding of human relationships through Artificial Intelligence\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This guide will provide you with the necessary knowledge to effectively use this dataset for Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based applications. \n> \n> - Download and install the dataset: To begin using the dataset, download it from Kaggle onto your system.
