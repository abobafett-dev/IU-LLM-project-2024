Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) sample data have been used to generate annual percentages of non-institutionalized adult (18+) NYS residents with/without health insurance coverage. This curated dataset also includes a range of demographic and geographic categories, including: New York City/Rest of State, Sex, Race/Ethnicity, Age, Education, Income Limitation Status, Employment Status and Mental Health Status - allowing for more cross-sectional analysis. \n&gt; \n&gt; Using the BRFSS system -random digit dialing phone survey-, this dataset provides information for between 6,000 and 9,000 completed interviews per year through this timeframe. This is particularly relevant since data for 2011 forward are available elsewhere*.
