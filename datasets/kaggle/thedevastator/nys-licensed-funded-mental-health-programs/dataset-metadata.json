These programs serve a wide array of populations in need and are spread all across the state, and this dataset compiles a list of all those programs so you have access to vital information such as program name, sponsor name, code numbers, populations served, phone numbers and addresses. Whether you're looking for help within your own community or researching mental health services available within your state government, this dataset provides an important gateway to financial aid opportunities and local assistance providers. With such essential data provided for each program listed here--from agency codes to operating certificate requirements--you can enter the world of mental health with the knowledge that you have access to reliable resources. Download it today and benefit from everything it has to offer!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset provides detailed information about mental health programs in New York State that are licensed or funded by the Office of Mental Health. It includes information such as program name, address, sponsoring agencies and organizations, populations served, and operating certificate requirements. The data can be used to identify and investigate New York State mental health organizations and track their services, licenses and funding sources. \n> \n> To use this dataset effectively you should familiarize yourself with the different columns in the data. For example:  Row Created Time gives an indication on when this row of data was created; Sponsor Name is the organization who funds or sponsors the program; Agency Name is the organization which manages or oversees it; Populations Served indicates whobenefits from it; Operating Certificate Required? flag indicates if a license is required to operate the program etc. \n> \n> Once you are familiar with understanding each column in detail you can use your knowledge to search for specific information within an individual row of data (Program Search) or between multiple rows (Filter Search).  For example lets say we want to find volunteer based mental health programs run by Volunteer Organizations like churches etc., To do that we would need to set our Program Tier filter value = Volunteer Based Programs > Research Each records for Sponsor Name > Set it's value = Voluntary Organizations . Similarly one could also look up all residential care programs located in a specific zip code or all outpatient counseling programs run by XYZ agency using filters like Program Tier = Residential Care Homes + Program Zip Code = ABCD respectively.:\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Establishing mental health resources in underserved areas: This dataset can be used to identify the programs, agencies, sponsors and facilities offering these resources and to create heatmaps that illustrate where these services are concentrated. \n> - Tailoring mental health interventions: By analyzing the populations served by each program, researchers can develop customized interventions that focus on specific communities or demographic groups.\n> - Evaluating program effectiveness: By comparing outcomes across different tiers of programs and locations, stakeholders can compare performance metrics for different programs over time to measure effectiveness\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/stateofny)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: local-mental-health-programs-1.csv**\n| Column name                          | Description                                                                    |\n|:-------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Row Created Date Time**            | Date and time when the row was created.
