It contains an in-depth analysis of all purchases made through purchase card programs administered by the respective institutions. Investigate over 8,000 individual transactions to explore spending patterns across agencies, cardholders, vendors, and more! This dataset promises to be a rich source of valuable insights with columns measuring everything from year-month, agency number, agency name, cardholder last name and first initial to description, amount spent and merchant category code (MCC). Make sure no stone is left unturned with this extensive purchase data set \u2013 find out who\u2019s buying what when today!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset contains information on purchases made through the purchase card programs administered by the state and higher ed institutions in Oklahoma. The data can be used to better understand spending patterns over this fiscal year, identify where taxpayer money was being spent, and to look for potential areas of waste or fraud. \n&gt; \n&gt; Below are some tips on how to use this dataset: \n&gt; - Take a close look at the columns, such as Agency Name, Agency Number and Merchant Category Code (MCC). These columns will give you an idea of what type of expenditure is taking place and which specific agency it\u2019s for. This can help you narrow down your search for specific spending that could be relevant to your research question or project. \n&gt; - Use plotting methods such as boxplots or histograms with time series plots in order to visualize changes in total spend over time and discern patterns such as seasonality or large one-off payments during certain months periodically throughout the year \n&gt; - Examine how spend levels are distributed between different agencies using bar charts, allowing you to compare side-by-side their respective share relative to total spending over that period  \n&gt; - Look into average expenditure by Vendor/MCC pairing by looking at summary tables; this could also provide insight into whether these pairings have better deals than most other vendors/pairings when undertaking large orders   \n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully these simple tips have been helpful when learning how to use this dataset! Have fun exploring all the possibilities!\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Developing an analytics dashboard for government organizations to track and visualize their spending on a monthly basis to identify any potential fraudulent activities.\n&gt; - Creating a predictive model that can detect patterns of cardholder purchase behavior in order to spot any anomalies or unauthorized purchases. \n&gt; - Creating an AI-based system that integrates with the procurement system of the organization and provides proactive suggestions to help save money by finding vendors offering better deals or alternative products when similar spendings happen repeatedly around the same time every year etc\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/oklahoma)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **Unknown License - Please check the dataset description for more information.**\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: res_purchase_card_(pcard)_fiscal_year_2014_3pcd-aiuu.csv**\n| Column name                      | Description                                                       |\n|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Year-Month**                   | The year and month of the purchase.
