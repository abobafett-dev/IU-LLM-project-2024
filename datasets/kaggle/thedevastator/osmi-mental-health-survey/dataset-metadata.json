These data points allow people to understand more about how their peers in tech view mental health and can provide greater insight into how to better support those who work in this industry. This dataset includes questions on whether or not respondents have had a mental health disorder or sought treatment for a mental health issue in the past, if they currently have been diagnosed with a condition and what it is, their age group, location of work and residence as well as information on whether they are self-employed or working at a tech company with other questions. Additionally, this dataset also provides insight into respondents' attitudes towards speaking openly about their mental wellbeing versus physical wellbeing. To gain even more understanding of individual's experiences within their place of business overall employee count is included as well what role they fill within that organisation is related to technology/IT. This valuable data set may be used for medical research furthering our knowledge about workplace stressors effecting people seen within this particular field but also across multiple industries to help create support systems that reflect upon individual need rather than one-size fits all models previously employed by employers through out many parts globally\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyze the correlation between employment industry and mental health status, including self-identified diagnosis, use of mental health services and any history of mental illness in the family.\n&gt; - Determine if there are differences in how people experience and speak out about their own mental health based on geographic location.\n&gt; - Compare attitudes towards open conversations on physical vs mental health within different age groups both in the U.S. and abroad\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/dataforacause)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n&gt; - You are free to:\n&gt;      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt;      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt; - You must:\n&gt;      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n&gt;      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n&gt;      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: OSMI_Survey_Data.csv**\n| Column name                                                                                    | Description                                                                                                                       |\n|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Are you selfemployed**                                                                       | Indicates whether the respondent is self-employed or not.
