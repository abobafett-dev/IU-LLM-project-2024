It gives insight on placements from both NHS and independent providers, giving an overall picture of how these placements are happening across the country. \n> \n> By taking a closer look at this report we can gain understanding into what is going on with OAPs around us \u2013 like which questions are being asked, breakdowns of how it\u2019s divided and number to back it up. With this data we can better understand issues that affect our community and do our part to help support those in need\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> This dataset provides information on out of area placements in mental health services in England from both NHS and independent providers. The dataset contains data related to the number placements, as well as breakdowns by region and provider. With this data you can explore the trends for out of area placements in your region and compare those trends with national level figures. \n> \n> This guide will show you how to get started exploring this dataset. \n>  \n> ## Step 1: Understand The Data Set Structure \n> \n> The first step for getting started is to get a good understanding of the structure of the dataset itself in order to better understand what types of questions we can ask our data with. This dataset has several columns which have been listed below:  \n> \n>  - `Publication Type` : This column provides information on what type of report is being referenced such as statistical bulletin or key facts & figures etc \n> \n>  - `Publication Period`: This column represents a period within a year moment which periods are expressed by either month, quarter or financial year etc..\n> \n>  - `Publication Date`: This column informs us when the publication was made available online expressed as a date format e.g 2018-04-02)  \n> \n>  - `Question` : Here we will find measurements such as people waiting an average or median length times such that they answer certain question asked by officials. \n> \n>  - `Breakdown1`, `BreakDown1Code`, \u2018Breakdown1Description\u2019 : These columns provide extra context into specific highlights from results in further detail eg Breakdowns include areas like Age Group ,Nationality (for immigration statistics) gender for population statistics etc...     where code values may appear something like \u201cOAP_AGE___All\u201d and descriptions appear like \u201cWaiting Times All Ages respectively .  \n> \n>  - `BreakDown2`, `BreakDown2Code`, 'Breakdown2Description':These are data attributes similar top BreakDown 1 but at even more granular level eg Doctor Specialty/Department, Treatment Type, Indicators (for regional/local analysis), Countries ..etc .    It's important not note here that breakdown 2 has deeper break down against Breakdown 1 depending further detail asked while investigating deeper under specified parameters /results .Eg You might want drill down ages into age groups 0\u20134, 5\u201314 ,15-29....etc excluding 65+ corresponding breakdown codes might be OAP_AGE__0\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Creating insight into regional differences in mental health out of area placements in order to identify if more funding is needed and implement programs to address the predisposing risk factors for those regions with higher out of area placement rates. \n> - Comparing the amount of expenditure allocated on out of area placements between different areas and provinces, so that extra funding may be given to areas which need it more.  \n> - Examining the correlation between changes in funding or policy and its effects on out of area placements at both a national and local level, in order to assess whether certain policies are successful or not at curbing them such as introducing preventative measures before placement outside an individual's region is necessary\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/dataworldadmin)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n> - You are free to:\n>      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n>      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n> - You must:\n>      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n>      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n>      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: oaps-open-data-mar-2017-1.csv**\n| Column name               | Description                                                |\n|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **PublicationType**       | The type of publication the data is from.
