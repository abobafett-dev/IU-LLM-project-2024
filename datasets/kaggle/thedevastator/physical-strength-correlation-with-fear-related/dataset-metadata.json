It includes demographic information such as age, gender, and ethnicity, as well as physical strength measures \u2013 grip strength and chest strength \u2013 taken from undergraduate students from the University of California Santa Barbara, Oklahoma State University, University of Texas Austin, and Arizona State University. Additionally, the dataset includes self-report measures of HEXACO Emotionality to explore the effects of physical strength on fear-related personality traits - which is key information to consider when designing interventions for mental health issues. With this data we could discover how temperament affects physiological parameters such as grip or chest strength: Does having a fearful personality predispose someone to have decreased levels of physical power? How does this route differ dependeing on sex? Answering these questions could allow us to gain valuable insights into how greater bodily prowess affects unique psychological conditions that differ depending on gender.
