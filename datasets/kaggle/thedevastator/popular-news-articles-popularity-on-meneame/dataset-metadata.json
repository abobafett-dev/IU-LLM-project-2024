Here, we explore the various ways that users interact with news articles on the social news website throughout April 2021. Our dataset reveals how different article characteristics and user voting behavior can directly influence an article's popularity on the website. \n> \n> This dataset includes information covering different aspects of a story - from its title to source and total karma score. It also captures a variety of historical user interactions such as comments, anonymous votes, positive & negative feedback as well as how often an article is clicked by others. All these important details provide us with valuable insights into understanding which stories are more likely to be successful on Meneame's platform. \n> \n> So let us dive deep into this data and discover what makes articles go viral!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset provides insights into the popularity & user feedback trends on Meneame news articles. With this data, you\u2019ll be able to understand how certain characteristics and user voting behaviors can impact an article\u2019s overall popularity. Let's take a look at how to make the best use of this dataset:\n> \n> **1. Analyze Popularity Trends**: Examine the trends in clicks, comments, votes (positive/negative/anonymous) over time to determine which stories were most popular and when they were posted. You can also consider the limitations of the sample by looking at which website is represented in your results - Meneame or its subdomains? \n> \n> **2. Study Story Characteristics & User Voting Behaviors**: Use the columns contained in this dataset (title, web source, user who posted article) to look into what types of stories receive more positive feedback from users and whether there is a pattern among sources that publish such content. Additionally, study if different types of interactions (comments vs upvotes vs downvotes) have any effect on article popularity. \n> \n> **3. Explore Subreddit Interactions**: You may want to explore how different subreddits interact with posts on Meneame by reviewing unique karma scores per post and its respective subreddit (Sub column). It will also be interesting to compare story charactersitcs between high-traffic subreddits with low-traffic subsReddits in order to see what type o fcontent is most engaging for each type of community or audience group respectively!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Developing a predictive model to identify article characteristics that increase the popularity of articles on Meneame.\n> - Comparing the average user feedback rate of different types of news stories, in order to understand which ones generally receive the most engagement from readers.\n> - Studying the correlation between an article\u2019s popularity and its author\u2019s karma score, in order to understand how popular users can increase their visibility on Meneame\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/4678236#.Y9Y5b9JBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
