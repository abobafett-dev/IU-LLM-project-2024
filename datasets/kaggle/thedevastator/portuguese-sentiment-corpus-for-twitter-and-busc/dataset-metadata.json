By providing finer-grained annotation and labeling, this dataset allows for comparative sentiment analysis in Portuguese from Twitter and Buscap\u00e9 reviews. With humans assigned to annotate this data, it provides an accurate measure of the sentiment of Portuguese words in multiple contexts. The labels range from positive to negative with numeric values, allowing for more nuanced categorization and comparison between different subcategories within reviews. Whether you\u2019re mining social media conversations or utilizing customer feedback for analytics purposes, this labeled corpus provides an invaluable resource that can help inform your decision making process\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset, comprised of Twitter and Buscap\u00e9 reviews from Portuguese-speaking areas, provides sentiment labels at the word level. This makes it easy to apply to natural language processing models for analysis. The corpus is composed of 3,457 tweets and 476 Buscap\u00e9 reviews, with a total of 114 unique words in the lexicon along with associated human-annotated sentiment scores for each word. \n> \n> To properly utilize this resource for comparative sentiment analysis, you need an environment that can read CSV files containing both text and numerical data. With such setting, users can use machine learning algorithms to compare words or phrases within texts or across different datasets and gain an understanding of the opinion expressed towards various topics so far as they have been labeled in this corpus.  This data has been annotated according to 3 possible sentiment labels: negative (\u20131), neutral (0) or positive (+1).\n> \n> In order to work with this dataset effectively here are some tips:\n> \n>  - Familiarize yourself with the data which contains a list of Portuguese words and their associated sentiment labels \u2013 by reading through a full content list you will be able to understand how it works better;\n>  - Create a visualization tool that allows you not only see the weight assigned for each word but also do comparative analyses such as finding differences between same nouns used in different sentences; \n>  - Analyzing text holistically by taking into account contextual information; \n>  - Experimenting on different methods that may increase accuracy when dealing with unequal distribution of examples due to class imbalance; \n> \n>  By applying these above measures one should easily achieve reliable results by making use of this linguistically labeled database generated from two distinct corpora including tweets and Buscap\u00e9 reviews which have previously never been bridged together like this before! With its help it is now easier than ever before gain insights into people\u2019s opinion on various products based on their textual expressions in real time!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Comparing the sentiment of Twitter and Buscap\u00e9 reviews to identify trends in customer opinions over time. \n> - Understanding how the sentiment of customer reviews compares between different Portuguese languages and dialects.  \n> - Utilizing the labeled corpus for training machine learning models in natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and automated opinion summarization\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/4124410#.Y9Y8jdJBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
