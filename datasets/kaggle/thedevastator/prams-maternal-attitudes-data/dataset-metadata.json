Produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as part of the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), this population-based data contains insights into maternal abuse, alcohol use, contraception, breastfeeding habits, mental health issues, morbidity rates, obesity rates, preconception care patterns , pregnancy history data , prenatal care trends , sleep behaviors , smoke exposure rates , stress levels , tobacco use , WIC involvement  Medicaid utilization  infant health outcomes and unintended pregnancies. State health departments can use this information to devise strategies to improve the overall wellbeing of mothers and infants throughout all phases of prenatal care.
