The four indicators included in this record are: Total Precipitation (TPCP), Maximum Snow Depth (MXSD), Total Snow Fall (TSNW), and Extreme Maximum Daily Precipitation (EMXP). \n&gt; \n&gt; This dataset represents a valuable asset due to its wide variety of data collected from multiple points within one country over a relatively long timeframe - five years. As such, it can be used to provide deeper insights into possible patterns or underlying figures when analyzing weather patterns within Argentina and their impacts on different sectors like agriculture, tourism or health. \n&gt; \n&gt; Nonetheless, as this data is dynamic in nature there are some caveats that need to be taken into consideration when using this information. As an example, due to late arrival of some records the quantity of recent observations might not be properly represented on all categories; nevertheless, we can expect a good approximation towards final outcomes with the ratios between warm and cold records usually reliable enough for further analysis. \n&gt; \n&gt; This public domain resources is released under no restrictions whatsoever so it doesn't require further permission from its authors and it was last updated at TBD date - columns include date, datatype station value flag missing flag complete miss country indicator fields\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; # How To Use This Dataset \n&gt; This dataset contains daily summaries of precipitation indicators across Argentina.
