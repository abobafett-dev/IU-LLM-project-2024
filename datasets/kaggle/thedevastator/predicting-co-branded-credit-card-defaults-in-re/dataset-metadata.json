With over [x] columns of data, this dataset contains information ranging from applicants' demographics and credit scores to their limits and payment history. This comprehensive dataset was constructed with the goal of understanding how demographic factors influence credit risk and ultimately, co-branded credit card default rates. From age to income, marital status to educational background, each variable is used to create an understanding of the risks associated with applicants taking out co-branded cards in the retail network. Additionally, get an inside look at current trends in loan application behavior \u2014 see how often customers use loan or have applied for new cards over set time intervals \u2014 as well as monthly payments and query history. Use this unique dataset to develop an improved model for predicting credit card default that could help financial institutions assess potential cusotmers more accuracyly!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset aims to help predict co-branded credit card defaults in retail networks by providing a variety of information about the applicants. The dataset includes information such as age, gender, marital status, employment status, education level, monthly income and expenses, credit history length, number of loans and credit cards owned by the applicant, number of times they applied for loan/credit card inquiries and how many times they used each loan/credit card in the last months.  \n&gt; - In order to use this dataset effectively to predict co-branded credit card default rates in a retail network it is important to understand the data and how it's related each other. It is also important to consider any external factors that can influence an individual's likelihood of defaulting on a loan.  \n&gt; - The first step is to look at the descriptive statistics for each column so that we can get some idea as to what kind of values are seen most often among our data points and if there are any outliers present. This will give us an idea about which features may be most relevant when predicting defaults or if our model may need more contextual information from outside sources like socio-economic or political factors.  \n&gt; - Once we have identified any relevant features from our descriptive statistics analysis we'll then want to start exploring different ways these variables are related with one another and what kind of relationship these variables have with regards to defaults (both positively correlated/directly increase default risk plus negatively correlated/directly decrease default risk). This can be done through simple pair plots which show distribution and correlations between two given columns or triangular heatmaps which allow us explore correlations among multiple columns at once. Building upon these relationships further allows us then determine possible causes behind the observed correlations between different variable groups \u2013 allowing us get even more insight into why certain individuals are more likely than others be defaulters on their co-branded cards (whether it because they simply had bad luck or because there were larger systematic factors playing out).   \n&gt; - Having identified all relevant features from this data exploration process along with any external \u201cbackground\u201d data points - we finally move into constructing our machine learning models using appropriate algorithms suitable for predicting probability outcomes such as SVM or XGBoost tree ensembles etc.. When building out your ML model you\u2019ll want ensure that all parameters necessary for accurate predictions have been included before deploying them on production systems so as not compromise neither customer privacy nor product quality standards set by regulatory authorities governing such models across countries globally\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Using the given dataset to create a predictive model that can be used to identify customers at risk of defaulting on their co-branded credit cards. This could help determine which customers should be offered special incentives or strategies in order to reduce their risk of defaulting.  \n&gt; - Using the given dataset to create a financial health recommendation engine that analyzes customer\u2019s existing credit cards and recommends other ways they can improve their financial situation (e.g., balance transfers, better rewards programs, etc.). \n&gt; - Extracting insights from the data by performing sentiment analysis on customer\u2019s online reviews of legitimate co-branded credit card companies, in order to enable more effective marketing and outreach campaign targeting toward specific demographics or geographic regions with different purchasing preferences or concerns regarding co-branded credit cards\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/amitkishore)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n&gt; - You are free to:\n&gt;      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt;      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt; - You must:\n&gt;      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n&gt;      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n&gt;      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Training_dataset_Original.csv**\n| Column name         | Description                                                                                   |\n|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **application_key** | Unique identifier for each application.
