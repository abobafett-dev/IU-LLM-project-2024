Information collected includes demographics, medication use, and illicit drug use. This study will assess which factors are most likely to predict the risk of pain reliever misuse or abuse by looking at columns including age category, gender, marital status, education level, employment status, city/metropolitan area healthability levels mental health self-reported health; prescription medication misuse or abuse ever used heroin or tranquilizers in the past year; amphetamines used sedatives cocaine hallucinogens whether they received treatment for substance use and more. With this information readily available it is possible to better understand subtle indicators of potential risks as well as identify targeted areas for prevention efforts. The goal of this analysis is to comprehend how these factors can be used together to best predict the chance of misuse or abuse associated with pain reliever medications\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset contains information on demographics, medication use, and illicit drug use from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. This data can be used to predict the risk of pain reliever misuse or abuse. \n&gt; \n&gt; In order to effectively use this dataset, it is important to understand which factors can influence pain reliever misuse or abuse. The following variables are considered as predictors: Year, Age Category, Gender, Marital Status, Education Level, Employment Status City/Metropolitan Area Self-Reported Health Mental Health Misuse/Abuse of Prescription Medications Heroin Use Amphetamines Used Tranquilizers Used Sedatives Used Cocaine Use Hallucinogens Used Receipt of Treatment \n&gt; \n&gt; By analyzing these factors individually and together with one another our goal is to identify patterns which increase an individual\u2019s risk of misusing or abusing pain relievers. Additionally we hope to gain insight into how an individual's background may increase their risk of participating in such behaviors.  From this knowledge we can help develop programs targeting those at a high risk for misuse and abuse prevention programs specifically tailored towards the needs of that population\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Predicting risk of substance misuse and abuse in different demographics across the United States \n&gt; - Identifying and targeting high-risk populations with tailored public health campaigns \n&gt; - Evaluating the effectiveness of public education efforts by comparing pre-existing substance abuse trends to post-campaign results\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/2301844#.Y8OqptJBwUE)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
