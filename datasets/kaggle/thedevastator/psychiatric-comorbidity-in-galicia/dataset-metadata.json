By examining twenty-three-hundred patients across twenty-one treatment centers and harnessing information from sixtyfour healthcare professionals, COPSIAD has created an invaluable resource for exploring how mental disorders impact and interact with substance abuse/dependency. The results demonstrate that overhalf of all people undergoing assistance for addictive behaviors suffer from some type of mental disorder \u2014 be it an Axis I or II diagnosis. In particular, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, borderline personality disorder (BPD), and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) are found to be among the most common comorbid conditions that these individuals face. Accurately understanding this data helps us gain a deeper comprehension into an otherwise surprisingly complex landscape \u2014 providing a path forward in finding new treatments and solutions to help these patients lead healthier lives\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> - Start by exploring the descriptive data associated with each column in the dataset.
