Every grave or even minor accident is included - giving you the information you need to guard against preventable injuries and fatalities on our roads. The data includes location, number of people/vehicles involved, time (24hr), road surface, lighting conditions, weather conditions, local authority and casualty severity. \n&gt; \n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset provides information on all road accidents that occurred in Calderdale. It includes information regarding the location, number of people and vehicles involved, lighting conditions, weather conditions, severity of any casualties and many more features. The data can be used to analyse road traffic trends over the period and identify any key correlations between factors such as weather or lighting conditions which may have contributed to the accident. \n&gt; \n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyzing the locations of road traffic accidents with higher rates of casualties across Calderdale to determine any contributing factors and mapping them accordingly to help with strategies for reducing the number of casualties in a certain region or area.\n&gt; - Determining potential relationships between type of vehicle involved, casualty class, casualty severity, weather conditions and lighting conditions to discover mechanisms or components that increase road accident risk factors. \n&gt; - Cross-referencing this dataset with public transportation timetables to monitor trends in road traffic accidents surrounding public transportation methods in order to create prevention policies or implement interventions accordingly\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/dataworldadmin)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: accident-2016-8.csv**\n| Column name             | Description                                               |\n|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Reference Number**    | Unique identifier for each accident.
