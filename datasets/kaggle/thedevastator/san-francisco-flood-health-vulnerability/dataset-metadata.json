Predominantly sourced from local governmental health, housing, and public data sources, this index is constructed from an array of socio-economic factors, exposure indices,Health indicators and housing attributes. \n> Used as a valuable planning tool for both health and climate adaptation initiatives throughout San Francisco, this dataset helps to identify vulnerable populations within the city such as areas with high concentrations of children or elderly individuals. Data points included in this index include: census blockgroup numbers; the percentage of population under 18 years old; percentage of population above 65; percentage non-white; poverty levels; education level; yearly precipitation estimates; diabetes prevalence rate; mental health issues reported in the area; asthma cases by geographic location;; disability rates within each block group measure as well as housing quality metrics. All these components provide a broader understanding on how best to tackle issues faced within SF arising from any form of climate change related weather event such as floods or extreme storms\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset can be used to analyze the vulnerability of the population in San Francisco to the health impacts of floods and storms. This dataset includes a number of important indicators such as poverty, education, demographic, exposure and health-related information. These indicators can be useful for developing effective strategies for health and climate adaptation in an urban area. \n> \n> To get started with this dataset: First, review the data dictionary provided in the attachments section of this metadata to understand each variable that you plan on using in your analysis. \n> Second, see if there are any null or missing values in your columns by checking out \u2018Null Value\u2019 column provided in this metadata sheet and look at how they will affect your analysis - use appropriate methods to handle those values based on your goals and objectives. \n> Thirdly begin exploring relationships between different variables using visualizations like pandas scatter_matrix() & pandas .corr() . These tools can help you identify potential strong correlations between certain variables that you may have not seen otherwise through simple inspection of the data.  \n> \n>  Lastly if needed use modelling techniques like regression analysis or other quantitative methods like ANOVA\u2019s etc., for further elaboration on understanding relationships between different parameters involved as per need basis\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Developing targeted public health interventions focused on high-risk areas/populations as identified in the vulnerability index. \n> - Establishing criteria for insurance premiums and policies within high-risk areas/populations to incentivize adaption to climate change.\n> - Visual mapping of individual indicators in order to identify trends and correlations between flood risk and socioeconomic indicators, resource availability, and/or healthcare provision levels at a granular level\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/sanfrancisco)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: san-francisco-flood-health-vulnerability-1.csv**\n| Column name                | Description                                                                             |\n|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Census Blockgroup**      | Unique numerical identifier for each block in the city.
