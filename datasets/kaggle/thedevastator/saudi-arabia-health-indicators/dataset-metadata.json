This data is critical in understanding and addressing public health issues related to mortality and global health estimates, sustainable development goals, millennium development goals (MDGS), service organization and delivery prevention programs and providers, child health, infectious diseases, human resources management systems, youth initiatives, noncommunicable diseases and mental health interventions. This multi-category information provides useful insights on complex interactions between mobility of populations across geographic regions as well as monitoring the progress of established international Health Regulations (2005). Additionally this database allows analysts to draw meaningful comparison through collecting data across sex groups plus essential technologies investments such as medical equipment evaluations. All this information has been collected from reliable sources-such as surveys or registry- for users to use it for analytical or research purposes only. It is important to note that the displayed values have been rounded off for better readability; therefore details about individual indicator metadata should be referred in their respective corresponding links provided within the dataset description \n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    Alternatively, if instead of studying a single indicator like mortality rate alone, you are interested in several different ones across different categories at once \u2013 say mental health indicators alongside prevention programs - simply include all relevant columns while analyzing instead.    \n&gt;  \n&gt; Finally after having customized your analysis depending on which type indicators or how many types of indicators that interests you best; now its time to dive deep into statistical analysis using different tools available like Python Pandas library for data manipulation and plotting libraries like Matplotlib for visualization!
