It is available for students in Years 5, 6, 7, 9 and 11 \u2013 with the survey now being extended to include SILC and post-16 settings too. \n&gt; \n&gt; This survey allows schools to measure student health behaviours in order to improve their well-being as it provides an instant snapshot of data on important areas like Healthy Eating, Physical Activity and Sports, Drugs, Alcohol and Tobacco consumption , Sexual Health amongst others. \n&gt; \n&gt; Where blank sections appear on the data set does not mean that there is no information - instead these questions have been directed towards different year groups.  This dataset will provide a comprehensive picture of how school age students perceive their own health and well-being from across key areas such as society values, mental states including feelings associated with being bullied or worried , physical activity levels measured by minutes per week active or whether they partake in certain activities either through college/school or outside it.  Schools can also measure drug use levels weekly basis as well games clubs offered by them which are both enjoyed during break times or lunchtimes. All this taken together should help a school develop a more holistic view of their student\u2019s individual needs when it comes to providing for their physical health as well as day-to-day triggers which may affect their mental wellbeing within the learning environment.\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; \n&gt; - Explore available columns - The first step when utilizing this dataset is to become familiar with the available columns.
