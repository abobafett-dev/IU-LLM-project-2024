It includes posts and comments from the OpenCare platform which allow users to discuss and collaborate on global health issues. With this data set you can explore annotations and coding tags used by participants to describe their discussions as well as analyze post replies, likings, and other user engagement metrics. OpenCare provides a comprehensive look at how international stakeholders interact with each other on issues related to global health \u2014 allowing policy makers, researchers, academics and even everyday citizens to gain insight on the larger implications of healthcare decisions made in different countries around the world. Join us in exploring this dataset today \u2013 there\u2019s infinite potential when it comes uncovering trends that can improve patient care worldwide!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> \n> - Understand What\u2019s in the Dataset- Before you can start making use of the data in this dataset, it\u2019s important to understand what types of information are included in each column. The columns such as text contain conversation posts or comments while others include annotations or coding tags associated with particular posts or comments. It's also important to learn which columns contain unique identifiers like uri so you have an easier time working with your data afterwards. \n> \n> - Clean & Analyze Your Data - After exploring what is included in each column in your dataset it\u2019s time to start cleaning it up! Depending on the type of analysis that you plan on doing you can choose which fields (columns) need to be cleaned up first before further analyzing them together such as participant\u2019s names or post/comment contents if needed.  Once these pieces are cleaned up then dive into some exploratory analytics to understand better about conversations that were held on OpenCare Platform - for example check out relationships between participants by looking into replies and likings made between different users involved in conversations etc.. \n> \n>  3. Visualize Your Results- Once all your analysis has been completed its time to visualize your results so others can make sense out of it easily! Whether its using style sheets developed within a platform like Tableau or other visualization tools like ChartJS depending on what best suits the complexity levels of results/analysis one might have come across through their analysis journey! Visualizing content shared by different users who had encountered issues & collaborating attempts aimed towards crisis resolution will give an overall idea about community driven concepts being discussed using OpenCare platform\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Analyzing the spread of health information among different user groups to identify potential target audiences for campaigns or initiatives related to public health. \n> - Examining relationships between users in different regions and countries based on their interactions and collaborations on openCare platform. \n> - Visualizing the network of user relations and interactions, in order to better understand how users are connected, or have a shared interest within a particular topic related to global health issues\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/4737409#.Y9Y_R9JBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
