Featuring 130,430 LoRaWAN messages collected in the city center of Antwerp, 14,378 Sigfox messages recorded in Antwerp city center and 25,638 Sigfox messages collected between Antwerp and Ghent rural regions. The data is presented as an extensive collection of metadata including receiving time stamps, base station identifiers and Received Signal Strength Indicators (RSSI). To offer different perspectives on analysis possibilities this dataset also features Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for all signals along with Estimated Signal Power (ESP) metrics. In addition to that the coordinates for all LoRaWAN gateways in Antwerp are pinned within the data set opening up potential opportunities for cross comparison between urban and rural environments. Analyzing this data will provide details on current testing practices for fingerprinting algorithms allowing further insight into how robust these methods can be across diverse conditions ranging from metropolitan city centers to rural areas. This invaluable benchmark will ultimately enable researchers to improve their existing system models while comparing the performance results from both Sigfox and LoRaWAN networks!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; - Download the dataset from kaggle to get started. \n&gt; - Examine the data to better understand what is included in the set and how it is formatted. The dataset contains signal strength of BS 1-BS 84, RX Time, SF (Spreading Factor), HDOP (Horizontal Dilution of Precision) as well as Latitude and Longitude information for each location. \n&gt; - Data preparation is a necessary process prior to more extensive analysis of these data sets. This involves cleaning data by removing irrelevant variables that are not suitable for use in modeling or further processing, normalizing values so they can be used in comparison and sorting out any potential errors or inconsistencies that may exist in the data sets before getting started with your analysis. \n&gt; - Define measurable objectives that you would want to determine or learn from this dataset such as developing a model which accurately predicts locations associated with signals strengths collected across various Signal frequencies (SFs).   \n&gt; - Decide on an evaluation strategy such as using Mean-Squared Error (MSE) to measure performance of predicted hypothesized locations compared against observed longitudes/latitudes provided within this dataset before proceeding ahead into actual analysis phase \t  \n&gt; 6 In order to make best use of the given datasets here, it would be beneficial to apply separate algorithms separately onto them depending on their types - Regression algorithms should be used onto numerical variables like SF & HDOP while Classification models should employed onto categorical variables like BS 1- BS 84 . Find out about different Machine Learning techniques applied suitable for respective variable types and finalize an algorithm application list before moving onto implementation phase!     \t  \n&gt; 7 Once algorithms have been applied, validation checks need be done test the accuracy performance against objective within established criteria period -  once satisfied results can now safely interpreted accordingly towards decisions making exercise!\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Comparing the performance of Sigfox and LoRaWAN networks in urban and rural environments to prioritize the most cost effective network for a given location.\n&gt; - Analyzing the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of each received base station signal to evaluate the accuracy of fingerprinting localization algorithms in different types of large outdoor areas with various environmental features.\n&gt; - Utilizingthe Estimated Signal Power (ESP) and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) columns to further analyze how strength or noise affect signal integrity, thus maximizing accuracy when conducting finger printing localization testing in outdoor conditions\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/3904158#.Y9ZAptJBwUE)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
