Contributors have read through app descriptions and selected the relevant functions each app offers from a pre-chosen list.  This list spans from SMS, flashlights, weather updates to even whether the app uses phone contacts or not. Contributors are allowed to select numerous functionalities fitting for the each application listed. This dataset is especially meaningful as it provides an interactive way for users to learn about different apps and their included functionalities, ideal for anyone looking to get the most out of their technology products!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> Welcome!

Each row represents a phone app with data about its functionalities', description, name and judgement entries from contributors who evaluated them. In addition there are gold standard entries from trusted experts which are further indicated by _gold at end of variable name (eg choose_the_corresponding_functionalities_gold) for exact description about app's functions . There are also other variables such as last judgement entry time (_last judgement at).  \n> \n>                           ## 2. How to Access the Data ##   \n> \n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Identifying common functionalities that are widely used among different apps by analyzing the `choose_the_corresponding_functionalities` column in this dataset. \n> - Comparing the number of trusted judgments each app has with the actual number of downloads it has, to measure its popularity and accuracy. \n> - Analyzing customer reviews and ratings in relation to the functionalities of each app, using both the `choose_the_corresponding_functionalities` and `description` columns as metrics for customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction with certain product features for certain apps\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/crowdflower)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **Unknown License - Please check the dataset description for more information.**\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: smart-app-functionality-DFE.csv**\n| Column name                                       | Description                                                                      |\n|:--------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **_golden**                                       | A flag indicating if the row is a golden row.
