This remarkable set of information opens up new possibilities in terms of understanding and treating mental health by leveraging technological advances \u2014 while also providing valuable insights into important ethical considerations related to it. Our dataset thus offers researchers a crucial tool for unlocking advances in our understanding of mental health and its associated conditions \u2014 paving the way for further exploration through different contexts.$\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset contains valuable and comprehensive sensor data collected from smartphones as part of a feasibility study aimed at understanding mental health through the use of smartphone data. This dataset is ideal for researchers and data scientists who are interested in exploring the potential of smartphone sensors for aiding understanding of mental health. \n> \n> In this guide, we will be discussing how to best utilize this dataset to explore the different aspects associated with a user\u2019s experience with collecting mental health-related data via their device.

This can be used to group users who share similar technologies or devices, which can help us better understand how device differences may affect user engagement or experience with collecting this kind of data. \n> \n> The second set consists of demographics-related details such as participant 'age', 'gender' and 'phone_use' (or frequency). These columns give us insight into who is using what types/makes of devices in order to collect their mental health related data; it may uncover any trends associated with certain demographic segments receiving more benefit from certain types/makes compared to others etc.  \n> \n> The third set pertains more closely towards understanding participant engagement; these include 'time', 'bluetooth_use', 'running_problem' statuses which enable us determine whether participants experienced any issues using Bluetooth while trying to collect their respective datasets; did they feel comfortable enough while doing so? etc It also includes 'data_use' which would tell us how much usage was obtained from each participant on average (in MB). Additionally there are also survey based opinions on acceptability ('settings') describing whether participants felt that automated collection was acceptable or not included alongside battery status ('battery').  \n>           \t \t\t\t\t  \t                All in all by applying a combination analysis approach \u2013 examining different attributes separately as well as consulting other sources like survey results \u2013 deeper insights around user experience can be discerned via this unique dataset!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Analyzing the data to understand user engagement with the app, in order to develop methods of encouraging consistent use of smartphone sensors for mental health research.\n> - Investigating how battery life and device settings affect user experience with the app, as knowing these factors could help optimize usage in future studies.\n> - Combining this data with other datasets to build a better understanding of how mental health changes over time and how different activities might affect it \u2013 such as looking at changes in communication patterns or phone usage depending on mood levels/symptoms\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/1238226#.Y8OqbdJBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
