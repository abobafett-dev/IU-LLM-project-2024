Through this dataset, we can gain an understanding of the factors that influence suicide rates across different states, professions and genders. By examining this data we can better understand how to reduce these tragedies in India which are of great concern to citizens, families and the government alike. The columns include the State in India where the suicides occurred; Year in which the suicides occurred; Type_code of the profession of the person who committed suicide; Gender of the person who committed suicide; Age_group of such person; and Total number of suicides for a given State-Year-Typecode-Type-Gender-Agegroup combination. With this insightful data set at our disposal, we can gather valuable insights into why certain types people are more likely to take their own lives than others and look for solutions which would have meaningful implications for society at large\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset contains information about the number of suicides in India by state, year, type of profession, gender, and age group. It is an important resource for understanding the trends and patterns in suicides in India. This guide will explain how to use this dataset to gain insights into suicide rates across India. \n> \n> #### Exploring the Data \n> \n> The first step to exploring this data is to examine its structure. There are 8 columns that contain information about each suicide: State (the Indian state where the suicide occurred), Year (the year of occurrence), Type_code (the code for the type of profession or activity engaged in at time of death), Gender (male or female), Age_group (groups based on age-range), Total (total number of suicides for given state/year/type_code/type/gender/age group). In addition, there are other useful descriptive stats such as aggregate totals by year and aggregate totals by state as well as null values indicating missing data points that should be accounted for during analysis. \n> \n> #### Analyzing Trends\n> \n> Once you have a good understanding of the data structure, you can begin analyzing it for patterns and trends. You can look at overall trends across all states or focus on individual states to see if certain decades witness higher suicide rates than others due to specific socioeconomic factors within those states. Similarly, you may identify distinct patterns when examining activity related causes across genders or age groups both generally and within individual states \u2013 e.g., self-immolation witnessed significantly more amongst females than males within a given decade etc..  Alternatively you could find out what types occupations had higher incidences during certain years thus ruling out otherwise unlikely ways people chose \u2018suicide\u2019!\n> \n> Finally it may also be useful window shop; use this data set as research material before further framing hypotheses related too changes over time i historical events that directly caused shifts in societal norms like wars / pandemics etc.. And then corroborate results against timelines ascertained through secondary sources such newspapers / anecdotal reports or primary sources like census records summaries published by official agencies etc.. As a index towards which other activities were attempted within scope!  \n> \n> Overall these analyses can help policy makers understand better how best resources can be allocated while developing interventions aimed at reducing suicidal tendencies amongst different demographic segments including males & females , adolescents & elderly people respectively!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Analyzing trends in suicides across different states in India over time to identify regional disparities and support the implementation of targeted policies and interventions.\n> - Mapping out the suicide hotspots across age groups, genders, and profession types to better target prevention efforts in those areas.\n> - Examining differences by profession type among populations with higher suicide rates in order to suggest preventative measures or resources tailored specifically for such populations\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/rajanand)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Suicides_in_India.csv**\n| Column name   | Description                                                                           |\n|:--------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **State**     | The state in India where the suicides occurred.
