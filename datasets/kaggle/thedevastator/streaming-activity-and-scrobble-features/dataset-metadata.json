It includes streaming activities and scrobble features from various platforms and devices, such as YouTube, Spotify, local iTunes library, and Amazon Echo. The data is sourced from a household with a wide age range, encompassing individuals from birth to 38 years old.\n> \n> With an extensive range of columns, this dataset offers in-depth insights into music consumption patterns and preferences. Key attributes captured include the performer or artist name (**Performer**), song title (**Song**), Spotify genre tags (**spotify_genre**), URL for the Spotify track preview (**spotify_track_preview_url**), duration of the song in milliseconds (**spotify_track_duration_ms**), popularity score on Spotify (measured by **spotify_track_popularity**), explicit content indicator (represented by **spotify_track_explicit** flag), danceability rating (**danceability**), energy level (**energy**), key of the song's composition (**key**) in musical notation format (e.g., C sharp or D flat major/minor scale).\n> \n> Additionally, other valuable metrics include sound loudness measured in decibels (dB) (**loudness**) that defines the overall volume intensity present within each song. The mode attribute indicates whether the song is composed primarily in a major or minor key tonality system (`major` or `minor` values respectively). Speechiness measure quantifies the presence of spoken words within a given track on a numerical scale(**speechiness**) while acousticness score determines how much acoustic quality is exhibited with larger values indicating more prominent acoustic elements(**acousticness)**.\n> \n> The dataset also profiles instrumentalness score which implies whether a particular track leans more towards instrumental music without significant vocal components. Liveness metric assesses live audience presence during musical performances based on recorded sound characteristics(*liveness*). Valence measures the positiveness conveyed through melodic aspects inducing emotional response(**valence**), and tempo indicates the speed or pace of the song in beats per minute(BPM)(**tempo**). Time signature represents the rhythmic structure of a song, defined by numerator indicating beats per bar and denominator indicating note value that represents one beat(**time_signature**).\n> \n> The dataset includes information about scrobble timestamps in Central Time Zone (**TimeStamp_Central**) as well as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)(**TimeStamp_UTC**) to provide comprehensive insights into streaming trends with a geographic perspective.\n> \n> In summary, this rich dataset offers valuable information on music streaming preferences, ranging from detailed song attributes to user activity timestamps.
