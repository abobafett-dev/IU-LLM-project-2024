The national data includes multiple variables related to the occurrence of an accident; such as the number of casualties, vehicle types, time & date of accident occurrence, and more. Perfect for data scientists or traffic engineers looking to conduct further analysis or research on transportation risk management in India - this invaluable dataset is your first step towards a better driving future!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset contains data on traffic accidents in India from 2001 to 2014. The data includes the number of reported accidents, resulting fatalities and injured people for each month. This dataset can be used to gain insights into the rates of traffic accidents in India and analyze trends over time. \n&gt; \n&gt; To use this dataset, start by downloading it from Kaggle or whichever source you are using. After that, open the CSV file in a preferred software program (e.g., Microsoft Excel). From here, you will be able to view the data in rows and columns containing various pieces of information regarding traffic accidents over time. You can also apply filters or pivot tables to organize your data according to your specific needs. \n&gt; \n&gt; For instance, you may want to analyze trends in fatal car crashes over the years or identify which months have the highest numbers of injury-causing collisions so that appropriate measures may be taken at those times when necessary. Additionally, finding patterns related to road safety and accident prevention will be much easier as well given this comprehensive set of information about accident occurrence in India for 14 consecutive years -2001 till 2014-.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, this dataset serves as valuable resource for exploring traffic safety and conducting extensive research related thereto throughout all types of transportation systems including automobile engineering vehicles etc; all across India all through post-millennial period -2001-2014-\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Developing a predictive model for traffic accidents in India based on weather, time of day, and vehicle type.\n&gt; - Analyzing changes in safety standards over the years and their impact on traffic accidents in India. \n&gt; - Examining the correlation between various socioeconomic factors (such as unemployment rate) and the occurrence of traffic accidents in India over time\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/rajanand)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n&gt; - You are free to:\n&gt;      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt;      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt; - You must:\n&gt;      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n&gt;      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n&gt;      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Traffic_accidents_by_month_of_occurrence_2001-2014.csv**\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit [Rajanand Ilangovan](https://data.world/rajanand).\n\n",
