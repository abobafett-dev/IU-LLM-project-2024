It is a valuable source of information for researchers and marketers looking to gauge sentiment, sentiment orientation and other semantic aspects of online reviews. In this guide, we will show you how to use this dataset to uncover the insights it holds. \n> \n> - Analyzing Sentiment: The most straightforward way to use this data set is for analyzing sentiment in online reviews. Every review has a rating on a five star scale, which can be used as an indication of how satisfied the customer was with their experience at the hotel. You can use various methods such as text mining or machine learning models to deeper understand what is driving those ratings and determine which customers are more likely to rate positively or negatively based on their words used in the review itself. \n> \n> - Understanding Aspects: The review text included in each observation also provides valuable insight into what exactly customers liked or disliked about their stay. This data can be further inspected using techniques such as topic modeling to uncover topics that people mention when writing positive/negative reviews - making this model ideal for understanding what aspects are driving satisfaction with hotels \n> \n> - Prediction Models: Finally, you could build upon all these insights by using them in predictive models such as logistic regression or support vector machines which predict customer ratings based on certain features extracted from the text through natural language processing (NLP). By identifying relationships between certain topics mentioned and ratings given, businesses can better target campaigns that strengthen relationships with existing customers while justifying budgets allotted towards acquiring new ones!  \n> \n>  In conclusion, by exploring characteristics such as customer sentiment and its orientation through textual analysis of online reviews you can get an invaluable perspective into your products overall performance - allowing decisions makers to make well informed marketing decisions!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Training a text classifier to determine positive or negative sentiment in hotel reviews.\n> - Developing an automated summarization tool to quickly identify the most important points discussed in a review.\n> - Identifying specific topics that customers commonly complain about when writing product reviews on TripAdvisor, as well as surfacing constructive feedback for businesses looking to improve their services and offerings\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/1219899#.Y9Y_N9JBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
