The sheer scale of this crisis is inspiring people of all ages, backgrounds, and geographies to come together to tackle the problem. The Household Pulse Survey from the U.S. Census Bureau was published with federal agency collaboration in order to draw up accurate and timely estimates about how Covid-19 is impacting employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing stability, education interruption, and physical and mental wellness amongst American households. In order to deliver meaningful results from this survey data about wellbeing at various levels of society during this trying period \u2013 which includes demographic characteristics such as age gender race/ethnicity training attainment \u2013 each consulted household was randomly selected according to certain weighted criteria to maintain accuracy throughout the findings This dataset will help you explore what's it like on the ground right now for everyone affected by Covid-19 - Will it inform your decisions or point you towards new opportunities?\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset contains information about the mental health care that U.S. households have received in the last 4 weeks, during the Covid-19 pandemic. This data is valuable when wanting to track and measure mental health needs across the country and draw comparisons between regions based on support available. \n> \n> To use this dataset, it is important to understand each of its columns or variables in order to draw meaningful insights from the data. The \u2018Indicator\u2019 column indicates which type of indicator (percentage or absolute number) is being measured by this survey, while \u2018Group\u2019 and 'Subgroup' provide more specific details about who was surveyed for each indicator included in this dataset. \n> \n> The Columns \u2018Phase\u2019 and 'Time Period' provide information regarding when each of these indicators was measured - whether during a certain phase or over a particular timespan - while columns such as 'Value', 'LowCI' & 'HighCI' show us how many individuals fell into what quartile range for each measurement taken (e.g., how many people reported they rarely felt lonely). Similarly, the column Suppression Flag helps us identify cases where value has been suppressed if it falls below a certain benchmark; this allows us to calculate accurate estimates more quickly without needing to sort through all suppressed values manually each time we use this dataset for analysis purposes. \n> Finally, columns such as \u2018Time Period Start Date\u2019 & \u2018Time Period End Date\u2019 indicate which exact dates were used for measurements taken over different periods throughout those dates specified \u2013 useful when conducting time-series related analyses over longer periods of time within our research scope)   \n> \n> Overall, when using this dataset it's important to keep in mind exactly what indicator type you're looking at - percentage points or absolute numbers - as well its associated group/subgroup characteristics so that you can accurately interpret trends based on key findings had by interpreting any correlations drawn from these results!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Analyzing the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health care among different subgroups such as racial and ethnic minorities, gender and age categories. \n> - Identifying geographical disparities in mental health services by comparing state level data for the same time period.\n> - Comparing changes in mental health care indicators over time to understand how the pandemic has impacted people's access to care within a quarter or over longer periods\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/datagov-us)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n> - You are free to:\n>      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n>      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n> - You must:\n>      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n>      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n>      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: csv-1.csv**\n| Column name                | Description                                                                                    |\n|:---------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Indicator**              | The indicator being measured.
