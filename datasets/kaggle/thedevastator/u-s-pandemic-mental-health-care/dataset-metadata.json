Produced by a collaboration between the U.S. Census Bureau, and five other federal agencies, this survey was designed to measure both social and economic impacts of Covid-19 on American households, such as employment status, consumer spending trends, food security levels and housing disruptions among other important factors. The data collected was based on an internet questionnaire which was conducted through emails and text messages sent to randomly selected housing units from across America linked with email addresses or cell phone numbers from the Census Bureau Master Address File Data; all estimates comply with NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions.
