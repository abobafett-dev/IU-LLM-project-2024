Compiling records as early as 1950 to the present, Storm Data allows users to select storms by county or other custom criteria, listing hurricanes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, hail, floods, drought conditions, lightning strikes, blustering winds and snowfall accumulations among many other natural phenomena of varying intensities. All this raw material is organized chronologically by state and used selectively to gain a better understanding of our nation's diverse weather experiences. A maximum 120 day delay may exist in providing up-to-date Storm Data due to periodic updates released by NWS so users are afforded greater accuracy with their research efforts regardless for what purpose it\u2019s being sought \u2013 whether for analysis or education.  Making an informed decision about safety measures or studying historic trends related to climate change demands reliable data from trusted sources such as NCDC Storm Events Database; empowering us all with unimpeded access towards achieving a higher understanding of our environment\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset contains detailed information about various types of storms that have occured in the United States since 1950, including hurricanes, tornadoes, hail storms, and floods. The data is organized by county and can be used to analyze weather patterns or conduct research on severe weather events in particular regions of the country. Here are some steps to help you get started using this dataset:\n> \n> - Select a geographic area: You can start by selecting a specific state or county from where you would like to explore data on storm events. This will narrow down your search results so you can easily find more relevant data points. \n>  \n> - Filter for desired storm type(s): Next step is to filter for the particular type of storm event that interests you\u2014such as hurricanes, snowstorms, lightning strikes \u2014to further refine your search results based on specific criteria such as date range and damage estimates etc.. \n> \n> - Analyze the resulting data set: Lastly you\u2019ll need to analyze any additional fields available post filtering process like fatalities numbers , damage estimates , cities affected . Run analyses that could result in trends on severity of storms over time or location-based distribution etc.. Alternatively create charts / graphs which could help visualize any insights drawn from your findings better \n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Looking into the correlation between severe weather events and climate change by tracking historical data points from 1950 onwards with the NCDC Storm Events Database.\n> - Identifying trends in storm damages, such as those caused by hail, high winds, and other weather phenomena that could lead to better preparedness strategies for businesses or individuals who are vulnerable to certain risks in their area. \n> - Analyzing which states or counties have experienced the most severe weather events over the years and use this information to inform better mitigation planning ahead of potential disasters in those areas\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/datagov-us)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **Unknown License - Please check the dataset description for more information.**\n\n### Columns\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit [US Open Data Portal, data.gov](https://data.world/datagov-us).\n\n",
