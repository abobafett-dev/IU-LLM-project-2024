  "descriptionNullable": "_____\n# Global Trends in Mental Health Disorder\n### From Schizophrenia to Depression\nBy Amit [[source]](https://data.world/amitd)\n_____\n\n### About this dataset\n&gt; This dataset contains informative data from countries across the globe about the prevalence of mental health disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, drug use disorders, depression and alcohol use disorders. By providing this data in an easy to visualise format you can gain an insight into how these issues are impacting lives; allowing for a deeper understanding of these conditions and the implications. Through this reflection you may be able to answer some important questions: \n&gt; - What are the types of mental health disorder that people around the world suffer? \n&gt; - How many people in each country suffer mental health problems? \n&gt; - Are men or women more likely to have depression? \n&gt; - Is depression linked with suicide and what is the percentage rate? \n&gt; - In which age groups is depression more common?  \n&gt; From exploring patterns between prevalence rates through in-depth data visualisation you\u2019ll be able to further understand these complex issues. The knowledge gained from this dataset can help bring valuable decision making skills such as research grants, policy making or preventative intervention plans across various countries. So if you wish to create meaningful data viz then start with this global prevalence of mental health disorder\u2019s together with accompanying videos for extra context - Deepen your understanding about Mental Health Disorders today!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; \n&gt; Using this dataset is quite straightforward. Each row of the table contains information about a certain country or region for a certain year. The following columns are provided: Entity (the country or region name), Code (the code for the country or region), Year (the year the data was collected) Schizophrenia (% - percentage of people with schizophrenia), Bipolar Disorder (%) - percentage of people with bipolar disorder) Eating Disorders (%) - Percentage of individuals with disordered eating patterns Anxiety Disorders (%) - Percentage of individuals with anxiety Drug Use Disorders (%) - Percentage figures for those struggling with substance abuse Depression (%) \u2013 Percentages relating to those struggling with depressive illness Alcohol Use Disorders (%) \u2013 Percentages relating to those battling alcoholism \n&gt;   \n&gt; Using this dataset requires no special skills; however it is best suited for those comfortable navigating spreadsheets and tables as well as analyzing numerical information quickly and accurately. Many software suites like excel are useful here but simple internet searches will reveal free alternatives if your preference is web-based solutions!  \n&gt; \n&gt; By piecing together these different columns\u2019 values we can get an idea if prevalence rates across different types of mental illnesses increase or decrease over time. For example we could compare depression levels between 2015 and 2018 by creating two separate sets containing information filtered just within our parameters respectively only reading records from 2015 then 2018). From here we can see whether numbers changed very much or stayed stagnant supefying any sort of patterns that could exist\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Visualizing the prevalence of mental health disorders - Create a data visualization that compares and contrasts the prevalence of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, eating disorders, alcohol use disorder and drug use disorder across different countries. This could provide insight into global differences in mental health and potential causes of those differences.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mapping depression rates - Create an interactive map that shows both regional and national variations in depression rates within a specific country or region. This would allow people to easily identify areas with higher or lower than average prevalence of depression which could help inform decision-makers when it comes to policy-making related to mental healthcare services provisioning. \n&gt; \n&gt; - Developing predictive models for mental health - Use the data from this dataset as part of a larger machine learning project to build predictive models for mental health across countries or regions based on various factors such as demographics, economic indicators etc., This can be helpful for researchers working on understanding populations\u2019 susceptibility towards developing certain disorders so as to craft appropriate preventive strategies accordingly\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/amitd)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Mental health Depression disorder Data.csv**\n| Column name                   | Description                                                                                      |\n|:------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Entity**                    | Unique identifier for each country or region included in the data set.
