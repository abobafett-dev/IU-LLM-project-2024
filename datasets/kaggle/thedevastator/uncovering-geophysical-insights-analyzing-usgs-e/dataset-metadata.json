It is crucial to gain an understanding of the frequency and strength of these seismic activities, as this information is essential in both the cause and preventions of damaging earthquakes. Fortunately for us, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) captures comprehensive data on Earthquakes magnitude and location across the United States and its surrounding areas. \n&gt; \n&gt; This dataset contains information such as time, latitude, longitude, depth, magnitude, type, gap between azimuthal gaps (gap), dmin which is minimum distance to nearest station (dmin), root mean square travel time residual (rms), Network which reported raised an incident report (net), updated date that was last updated or modified(updated) place horizonation uncertainty error - absolute value serves as 95% confidence interval radius(horizontalError)depth Horizonation uncertainty error - absolute value serve as 95% confidence interval radius(depthError)magHorizonation uncertainty error - absolute value serve as 95% confidence numberof seismic stations used to measure magnitude(magNst )Number statuses ie reviewed/reviewed_manual/automatic etc..status). This data can be a useful tool in building a more contextual picture around potential dangers posed by seismic activity\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset can be incredibly useful in uncovering geophysical insights about earthquakes. It contains comprehensive data about the magnitude and location of seismic activity, which can help to better understand the cause and prevention of damaging quakes. \n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Generating earthquake hazard maps to indicate seismic activity and risk levels in different areas.\n&gt; - Developing predictive models of earthquake magnitude and probability of occurrence on the basis of geographic characteristics, previous seismic history and observed patterns of activity. \n&gt; - Conducting analysis to determine correlations between geological features, human activities, and seismic events in order to better understand the causes and effects of potentially damaging earthquakes\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://github.com/ariayang97/nicar2022)\n&gt; \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
