Furthermore \u2013 some formulae should also be introduced where applicable since users may not understand why certain calculations were done (such as calculating expected value). All such things should be clarified properly via descriptions instead of just listing down numerical values without explaining anything else related to them!    \n&gt; \n&gt; **Analyze differences between states using appropriate graphs & diagrams**\n&gt; Data visualization plays an essential role while trying out various\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyzing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns for various state lotteries by examining sales of different scractcher tickets.  \n&gt; - Examining the lottery scratcher game price points to identify selling opportunities or trends in preferences across states.  \n&gt; - Utilizing the data to apply statistics and modeling techniques to project future expected values from similar scratch games across different states\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://github.com/DarrenZastruga/scratchersdatapull)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
