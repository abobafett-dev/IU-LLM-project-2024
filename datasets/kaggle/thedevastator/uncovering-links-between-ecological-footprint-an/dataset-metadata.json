Uncover correlations between human consumption, geography, political and economic conditions with individual country data on total and per capita biocapacity, ecological footprint of consumption and production as well as total area in global hectares. All packed into one dataset from Global Footprint Network's ecological research!  \n&gt; \n&gt; Investigate how our ecologically demanding lifestyles contribute to or detract from global sustainability with this collection of critical global data. Join us in driving action for a sustainable future by using all our resources responsibly - join in leveraging modern analytics on this NFA 2018 Edition data set  to explore relationships between nations' pattern of resource use and their possible impacts on nature. Assistance can come in many forms: joining other related datasets to create deeper insights; writing queries; creating visualizations; posting findings \u2013 all contributions welcome!

With this dataset you can:\n&gt; \n&gt;  - Analyze country-specific trends in ecological footprint and biocapacity \n&gt;  - Compare regions/countries with regard to ecological/biocapacity metrics  \n&gt;  - Investigate resource usage differences by activity type (e.g., crop_land vs forest_land) \n&gt;  - Create infographics outlining the Environmental Responsibility metric of Earth Overshoot Day  \n&gt; \n\n&gt; On first glance the dataset seems extremely organized\u2014however its most important details can be hard to find with so many columns!
