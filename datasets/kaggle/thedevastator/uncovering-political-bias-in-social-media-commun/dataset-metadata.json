Contributors studied their content to classify the messages according to audience - either national or constituent - bias, as well as its actual substance (informational, announcement of a media appearance, an attack on another candidate, etc). This dataset is a valuable tool for uncovering insight into the political dynamics in modern America by exploring topics such as partisan and neutral/bipartisan message leanings among different audiences. With 5000 rows of data points from various sources at your fingertips, you can get definitive answers about what type of reactions different types of political messages produce. Get ready for a never before seen view on the world\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset can be used to uncover political bias in social media communication among US Senators and other American politicians. The data contains 5000 social media messages, which have been classified into audience, bias and message content. \n&gt; \n&gt; To get started with the dataset, it is important to familiarize yourself with the columns of data that can be found in the dataset. These columns include: \n&gt; - \u2018_golden\u2019 (Boolean): Indicates whether the row is a golden row or not\n&gt; - \u2018_unit_state\u2019 (String): State of the unit \n&gt; - \u2018_trusted_judgements\u2019 (Integer): Number of trusted judgments for this row \n&gt; - \u2018_last_judgement\u2019 (Timestamp): When was last judgment was made for this post?\n&gt; - \u2018audience\u2019 (String): Who is the intended audience for this post? National or constituency? \n&gt; - 'bias' (String): What type of bias does this message convey? Neutral/bipartisan or biased/partisan?  \n&gt; - 'orig__golden' (Boolean): Indicates whether the row is a golden row or not  \n&gt; - 'audience_gold'(String) : Audience type which has been set as gold standard  \n&gt; \n&gt;  - 'bias gold'(String) Bias type which has been set as gold standard   \n&gt; \n&gt;  - `embed`(String) : Embed code of post   \n&gt; \n&gt;  - `label`( String ) : Label assigned to post based on its sentiment  \n&gt; \n&gt;  - `message gold`( String ) : Message content which has been set as golden value   \n&gt; \n&gt;  - `Source`( String ) : Source from where information originated from     \n&gt; \n&gt;  - `text`( String ) : Text used in message by author    \n&gt; Once you are familiar with these columns, you will then want to explore different ways in which you can analyze and utilize your data. For example, you may want to create visualizations such as heat maps that show partisan and bipartisan messages across various geographies or states, analyze usage patterns by time or day of week etc., chart changes in message tone over time at specific accounts etc. You may also want to look at trends by political parties to see if some topics are more popular than others among certain groups. And finally utilize topic modelling techniques such as LDA model etc., to determine key topics present across multiple tweets added between different accounts and analyze each group's opinion specifically on those topics\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Developing an automated classification system using machine learning algorithms to accurately classifying audience, bias, and message content of social media messages. \n&gt; - Identifying topics or issues that are being most talked/discussed on political social media accounts by tracking the messages with certain tags/label over time through data analysis. \n&gt; - Clustering tweets based on different characteristics like user behavior and sentiment to better understand how people interact with politically-charged content on social media platforms and draw insights into the evolution of public opinion around important topics such as elections or laws changes\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/crowdflower)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; **Unknown License - Please check the dataset description for more information.**\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Political-media-DFE.csv**\n| Column name            | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|:-----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **_golden**            | A boolean value indicating whether the row is a golden row or not.
