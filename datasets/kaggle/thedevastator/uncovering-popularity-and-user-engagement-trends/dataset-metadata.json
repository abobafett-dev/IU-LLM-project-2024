With this data, researchers can discover trends related to user engagement and popular topics within subreddits. By examining the \u201cscore\u201d and \u201ccomms_num\u201d columns, our researchers will be able to pinpoint which topics are most liked, discussed or shared within the various subreddits. Researchers may also gain insights into not only how popular a topic is but how it is growing over time. Additionally, by exploring the body column of our dataset, researchers can understand more about which types of news stories drive conversation within particular subreddits\u2014providing an opportunity for deeper analysis of that subreddit\u2019s diverse community dynamics\n&gt; \n&gt; The dataset includes eight columns: **title, score, id, url, comms_num** created**body and timestamp** which can help us identify key insights into user engagement among popular subreddits. With this data we may also determine relationships between topics of discussion and their impact on user engagement allowing us to create a better understanding surrounding issue-based conversations online as well as uncover emerging trends in online news consumption habits\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This dataset is useful for those who are looking to gain insight into the popularity and user engagement of specific subreddits. The data includes 8 different columns including title, score, id, url, comms_num, created, body and timestamp. This can provide valuable information about how users view and interact with particular topics across various subreddits. \n&gt; \n&gt; In this guide we\u2019ll look at how you can use this dataset to uncover trends in user engagement on topics within specific subreddits as well as measure the overall popularity of these topics within a subreddit. \n&gt; \n&gt; **1) Analyzing Score:** By analyzing the \u201cscore\u201d column you can determine which news stories are popular in a particular subreddit and which ones aren't by looking at how many upvotes each story has received. With this data you will be able to determine trends in what types of stories users preferred within a particular subreddit over time.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; **2) Analyzing Comms_Num:** Similarly to analyzing the score column you can analyze the \u201ccomms_num\u201d column to see which news stories had more engagement from users by tracking number of comments received on each post. Knowing these points can provide insight into what types of stories tend to draw more comment activity from users in certain subreddits from one day or an extended period of time such tracking post activity for multiple weeks or months at once 3) Analyzing Body: Additionally by looking at the \u201cbody\u201d column for each post researchers can gain a better understanding which kinds of topics/news draw attention among specific Reddit communities..  With that complete picture researchers have access not only to data measuring Reddit buzz but also access topic discussion/comments helping generate further insights into why certain posts might be popular or receive more comments than others  \n&gt; \n&gt; Overallthis dataset provides valuable insights about user engagedment related specifically topics trending accross subsbreddits allowing anyone interested reseraching such things easier way access those insights all one place\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Grouping news topics within particular subreddits and assessing the overall popularity of those topics in terms of scores/user engagement. \n&gt; - Correlating user engagement with certain news topics to understand how they influence discussion or reactions on a subreddit. \n&gt; - Examining the potential correlation between score and the actual body content of a given post to assess what types of content are most successful in gaining interest from users and creating positive engagement for posts\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n\n&gt; [Data Source](http://reddit.com/r/news)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
