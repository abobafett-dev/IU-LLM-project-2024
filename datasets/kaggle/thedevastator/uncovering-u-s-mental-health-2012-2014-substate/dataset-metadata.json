The estimates come from a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach, generated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the Total U.S. row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are provided as well. Along with this, there is an Order column that can be used to sort the data into its original order and a Map Group column which serves to distinguish different substate regions included in the maps from one another. By analyzing this extensive collection of information gathered from SAMHSA's National Survey on Drug Use and Health for the years 2012 - 2014, researchers can gain valuable insights into better understanding mental illness on both macro-level (across states) and micro-level scales (such as individual counties or cities)\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset provides estimates of mental illness in the United States from 2012-2014, broken down by state and substate region, along with 95% confidence intervals. In order to use this dataset effectively, it is important to first understand the columns included in this dataset. \n&gt; \n&gt; The \u201cOrder\u201d column lists a numerical order of the data which can be used to sort the data in its original sort order. The \u201cMap Group\u201d column is a numerical group that can be used to distinguish substate regions included in the maps from other substate regions. A \u201c1\u201d represents the national estimate, a \u201c2\u201d represents census region estimates, a \u201c3\u201d represents state-level estimates while a \u201c4\u201d and \u201c5\u201d respectively represent substate/aggregate region-level estimates included and not included in the maps. \n&gt; \n&gt; The remaining columns\u2014State, Substate Region, 95% CI (Lower),and 95% CI (Upper)\u2014are self explanatory; listing each state followed by its corresponding estimated mental illness percentage for 2012-2014 accompanied by its lower and upper bounds for 95 % confidence interval percentiles respectively. \n&gt; \n&gt; By using these variables together within this dataset as well as combining them with outside research/knowledge on US states or areas of interest within different US states can provide valuable understanding on mental health trends throughout different areas of different U.S states during 2012 - 2014 period of time when gathered information was collected.\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyzing regional mental health trends over time by examining the data across multiple years in order to compare and contrast the differences of mental illness prevalence among states and substate regions. \n&gt; - Creating visualizations such as maps or charts to illustrate the variation in mental illness prevalence between states and within each state by substate region, utilizing both higher-level (state-wide) and lower-level (substate/aggregate region) estimates.\n&gt; - Examining relationships between areas with higher rates of mental illness to indicators such as poverty, education level, access to medical care, etc., which may help identify potential underlying causes of differences in prevalence\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/samhsa)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n&gt; - You are free to:\n&gt;      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt;      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt; - You must:\n&gt;      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n&gt;      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n&gt;      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: 2012-2014_Substate_SAE_Table_25.csv**\n| Column name         | Description                                                                                                        |\n|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Order**           | A numerical value used to sort the data into its original order.
