Through our analysis, we seek to observe patterns and trends that capture the progress made in providing effective services for those in need. Specifically, this dataset contains details on the number of eligible adults receiving mental health treatment and a target for increasing that number by 2018. Using these figures, we can ascertain how successful efforts have been in addressing issues related to mental health among vulnerable populations. With this data set, we can identify areas where such efforts may have been hindered or benefited by external forces to inform future initiatives towards improved access and provision of beneficial services for those experiencing psychological distress. We hope our insights can be used as a starting point for creating sustainable solutions which support individuals\u2019 well being via quality treatments methods with tangible results\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset offers insight into the number of mental health treatment options available for eligible adults in each year from 2014 to 2018. It includes historical data on the number of individuals receiving treatment as well as a target for what should be achieved by 2018. \n&gt; \n&gt; For this dataset, one can use the following steps to analyze and understand the data: \n&gt; - Identify what is included in each column \u2013 years and historical data on eligible adults receiving mental health treatment, as well as a target figure set by 2018.\n&gt; - Review changes in numbers over time \u2013 plot a graph or chart to compare results over different years; look out for any unusual dips or highs that may warrant further investigation. \n&gt; - Compare figures against &lt;18 age groups \u2013 is there an increase or decrease? How do 18+-year-olds\u2019 access compare with those younger than 18? Are there any correlations between adult mental health treatment access and other social factors such as poverty levels, population distribution etc.? \n&gt; - Set specific goals using the \u2018Target\u2019 column \u2013 do you want to reach a certain number of users making use of available services by 2018? Set yourself achievable targets and compare your progress against baseline figures reviews your progress up until that point in time Remember: accurate benchmarking isn\u2019t just about achieving your long term learning objectives but also understanding why you did / didn\u2019t succeed along the way!\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Establishing baseline data of and designing mental health treatment interventions to increase the access to care for eligible adults. \n&gt; - Identifying disparities in the receipt of mental health services among different population groups based on age, gender, race etc. \n&gt; - Determining best practices for advertising or outreach campaigns targeted at increasing awareness about mental health resources for eligible adults\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/oklahoma)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; **Unknown License - Please check the dataset description for more information.**\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: res_adult_mental_health_treatment_u84c-zt9p.csv**\n| Column name         | Description                                                                                                      |\n|:--------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Years**           | The year in which the data was collected.
