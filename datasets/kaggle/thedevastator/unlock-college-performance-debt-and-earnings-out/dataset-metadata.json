It contains an extensive amount of data detailing information related to cost of attendance and various outcomes such as average salary after graduation, loan repayment rates, and gainful employment rates for graduates. The datasets also provides information on program level demographics such as gender breakdowns among enrolled students and faculty diversity in programs attended by students. This is an invaluable source of information for anyone who wants to make informed choices about their college education experience in terms of both costs and expected returns after graduation. Going beyond financial metrics, this dataset give insight into the cultural climate at each college or university so that users can analyze whether their unique backgrounds or experiences will fit into the campus ethos at those institutions. With this data set available to everyone interested in higher education options, individuals have a powerful tool to compare options from many perspectives including financial investment returns economics , educational quality measures ,  graduate success rate indices , faculty diversity break-ups etc \n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; \n&gt; This guide will provide guidance on how to utilize this powerful dataset to explore various stats related to college outcomes. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **Data Preparation:**\n&gt; Start by looking into the SQL query which is provided in order to get a better idea of what columns are available in this set. This will allow you to start thinking about what kind of information you want from your analysis and create an appropriate query for it (if desired).

Furthermore, use a combination of cleaning methods like reordering columns, removing outliers or observations based on criteria like missing values or extreme values etc.. This process should allow us us refine our raw data depending upon our requirements before beginning exploration.\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; **Exploratory Analysis & Visualization:**\n&gt; Now we can start our exploratory analysis process by examining relationships between different independent & dependent variables- with charts & tables being used heavily when coming up with insights/inferences from our plots & tables. Tools such as pivot-tables can also be used here depending upon our requirements (generally these come handy when dealing with large datasets). Alongside exploratory analytics many statistical tests may also come useful if we're required identify statistically significant relationships like ANOVA Test for two or more groups , regression models etc..
