Over this time period, the Health-Related Quality of Life dataset consists of a comprehensive survey reflecting the health and well-being of non-institutionalized US adults aged 18 years or older. The data collected can help track and identify unmet population health needs, recognize trends, identify disparities in healthcare, determine determinants of public health, inform decision making and policy development, as well as evaluate programs within public healthcare services.\n&gt; \n&gt; The HRQOL surveillance system has developed a compact set of HRQOL measures such as a summary measure indicating unhealthy days which have been validated for population health surveillance purposes and have been widely implemented in practice since 1993. Within this study's dataset you will be able to access information such as year recorded, location abbreviations & descriptions, category & topic overviews, questions asked in surveys and much more detailed information including types & units regarding data values retrieved from respondents along with their sample sizes & geographical locations involved!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset tracks the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) from 1993 to 2010 using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). This dataset includes information on the year, location abbreviation, location description, type and unit of data value, sample size, category and topic of survey questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Using this dataset on BRFSS: HRQOL data between 1993-2010 will allow for a variety of analyses related to population health needs. The compact set of HRQOL measures can be used to identify trends in population health needs as well as determine disparities among various locations. Additionally, responses to survey questions can be used to inform decision making and program and policy development in public health initiatives. \n&gt; \n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyzing trends in HRQOL over the years by location to identify disparities in health outcomes between different populations and develop targeted policy interventions. \n&gt; - Developing new models for predicting HRQOL indicators at a regional level, and using this information to inform medical practice and public health implementation efforts. \n&gt; - Using the data to understand differences between states in terms of their HRQOL scores and establish best practices for healthcare provision based on that understanding, including areas such as access to care, preventative care services availability, etc\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/health)\n \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: rows.csv**\n| Column name                    | Description                                               |\n|:-------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Year**                       | Year of survey.
