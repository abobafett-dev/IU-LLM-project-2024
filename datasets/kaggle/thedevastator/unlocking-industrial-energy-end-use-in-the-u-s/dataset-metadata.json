It provides an essential resource for understanding consumption patterns across different sectors and industries, as reported by large emitters (&gt;25,000 metric tons CO2e per year) under the U.S. EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). Our records have been calculated using EPA default emissions factors and contain data on fuel type, location (latitude, longitude), combustion unit type and energy end use classified by manufacturing NAICS code. Additionally, our dataset reveals valuable insight into the thermal spectrum of low-temperature energy use from a 2010 Energy Information Administration Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS). This information is critical to assessing industrial trends of energy consumption in manufacturing sectors and can serve as an informative baseline for efficient or renewable alternative plans of operation at these facilities. With this dataset you're just a few clicks away from analyzing research questions related to consumption levels across industries, waste issues associated with unconstrained fossil fuel burning practices and their environmental impacts\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset provides detailed information on industrial combustion energy end use in the United States. Knowing how certain industries use fuel can be valuable for those interested in reducing energy consumption and its associated environmental impacts. \n&gt; \n&gt; - To make the most out of this dataset, users should first become familiar with what's included by looking at the columns and their respective definitions. After becoming familiar with the data, users should start to explore areas of interest such as Fuel Type, Report Year, Primary NAICS Code, Emissions Indicators etc. The more granular and specific details you can focus on will help build a stronger analysis from which to draw conclusions from your data set. \n&gt; \n&gt; - Next steps could include filtering your data set down by region or end user type (such as direct related processes or indirect support activities). Segmenting your data set further can allow you to identify trends between fuel type used in different regions or compare emissions indicators between different processes within manufacturing industries etc. By taking a closer look through this lens you may be able to find valuable insights that can help inform better decision making when it comes to reducing energy consumption throughout industry in both public and private sectors alike. \n&gt; \n&gt; - if exploring specific trends within industry is not something that\u2019s of particular interest to you but rather understanding general patterns among large emitters across regions then it may be beneficial for your analysis to group like-data together and take averages over larger samples which better represent total production across an area or multiple states (timeline varies depending on needs). This approach could open up new possibilities for exploring correlations between economic productivity metrics compared against industrial energy use over periods of time which could lead towards more formal investigations about where efforts are being made towards improved resource efficiency standards among certain industries/areas of production compared against other more inefficient sectors/regionsetc \u2014 all from what's already present here!  \n&gt; \n&gt; By leveraging the information provided within this dataset users have access to many opportunities for finding all sorts of interesting yet practical insights which can have important impacts far beyond understanding just another singular statistic alone; so happy digging!\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyzing the trends in combustion energy uses by region across different industries.\n&gt; - Predicting the potential of transitioning to clean and renewable sources of energy considering the current end-uses and their magnitude based on this data. \n&gt; - Creating an interactive web map application to visualize multiple industrial sites, including their energy sources and emissions data from this dataset combined with other sources (EPA\u2019s GHGRP, MECS survey, etc)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/datagov-us)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
