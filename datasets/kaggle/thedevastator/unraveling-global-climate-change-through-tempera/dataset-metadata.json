It contains several data sets that provide insight on the past and current temperatures of our planet. By accessing this dataset, anyone can research and form their own views on this contentious yet important subject. \n&gt; \n&gt; We have included several files in this data set: GlobalTemperatures.csv which holds records of global average land temperature in Celsius, LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty representing the 95% confidence interval around that average, and LandMaxTemperatureUncertainty having the same level of uncertainty around its maximum land temperatures as well as more detailed information when substituting country or city in place off landindicating a more localized view of climate change patterns globally speaking. Other sources within this dataset include GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry which is a collection of data relative to country boundaries held over time best showcase actual heat temperature datapoints manipulated by human activity, GlobalLandTemperaturesByState which provides similar insights however done so through national borders rather than by territories - giving researchers another avenue for honing into dedicated population centres for their analyses; finally GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity focuses solely on major metropolitan areas world wide over various years giving researchers further clarity about local changes in climate due to year-round urban activities influencing outcomes too localized for country / state sourced datasets to account for without directly connecting eyewitness accounts with geo located coordinates manually associated with respective cities therein within same database making it even easier store & parse new information . \n&gt; \n&gt; Source: Kaggle Raw Data: Berkeley Earth Data Page\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; \n&gt; Before you start exploring different analyses, it helps to understand what type of data is being used by reviewing the file descriptions. The primary dataset that is included is GlobalTemperatures.csv which contains average land and ocean temperatures at a given date, as well as confidence intervals around each value for indicating uncertainty when measuring over time (e.g., 70 years ago). Additionally provided are separate datasets for global climate change by country (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv), state (GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv), major city (GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity) , or city (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity)  levels detailing average temperatures specific to geo-locations throughout each area/time period respectively;each dataset includes confidence intervals around each value for indicating uncertainty when measuring over time . For example: LandAverageTemperature describes the average land temperature providing further breakouts between Minimum/Maximum temperatures both with the respective uncertainty values associated with them per Time Period observed.\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Developing climate change models that track global average temperature trends by country and major cities.\n&gt; - Analyzing the correspondence between average temperatures and the locations of different natural resources or phenological events, such as insect swarming behavior or acclimation of trees to temperatures.\n&gt; - Conducting studies to understand how shifts in temperatures are impacting different ecological systems and how land-use changes can mitigate these effects\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/data-society)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n&gt; - You are free to:\n&gt;      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt;      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n&gt; - You must:\n&gt;      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n&gt;      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n&gt;      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv**\n| Column name                       | Description                                                   |\n|:----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **dt**                            | Date of the temperature measurement.
