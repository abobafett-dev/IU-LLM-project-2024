Conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago with sponsorship from the Data Foundation and Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, this probability-based survey offers valuable insight into three core areas related to physical health, economic and financial security, and social and mental health.\n&gt; \n&gt; Through this vital survey data, we can gain a better understanding of how individuals are dealing with symptoms related to COVID-19, their financial situation during this time period as well as changes in employment or government assistance policies, food security ization (in both nationwide & regional scope), communication with friends and family members, anxiety levels & if people are volunteering more during pandemic restrictions; furthermore gaining an overall comprehensive snapshot into what factors are impacting public perception regarding COVID-19\u2019s effect on US citizens.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Using these insights it's possible to track metrics over time - Observing which issues Americans face everyday but also long-term effects such as mental distress or self sacrificing volunteer activities that appear due to underlying stress factors. It\u2019s imperative that we properly weight our analysis when using this data & never report raw numbers; instead we must apply queries using statistical software such R/SPSS - thus being able to find results nationally as well as within 10 states + metropolitan areas across America whilst utilising margin of error for detecting statistically significant differences between each researched segment! \n&gt; \n&gt; Let\u2019s open our minds today \u2013 digging beneath surface level information so data tells us stories about humanity & our social behavior patterns during these uncertain times!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset contains survey data related to the impact of COVID-19 on US adult residents. The survey covers physical health, mental health, economic security, and social dynamics that have been affected by the pandemic. It is important to remember that this is survey data and must be properly weighted when analyzing it. Raw or aggregated numbers should not be used to generate insights. In order to weight the data appropriately, we recommend using statistical software such as R or SPSS or our provided queries (linked in this guide).\n&gt; \n&gt; To generate a table relating to a specific topic covered in the survey, use the survey questionnaire and code book to match a question (the variable label) with its corresponding variable name. For instance \u201cHow often have you felt lonely in the past 7 days?\u201d is variable \u201csoc5c\u201d. After entering a variable name into one of our provided queries, a sentence summarizing national results can be written out such as \u201cPeople in some states are less likely to report loneliness than others\u2026 nationally 60% of people said they hadn't felt lonely\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; When making comparisons for numerical statistics between different regions it is important to consider the margin of error associated with each set of surveys for national and regional figures provided within this document;  it will help determine if differences between groups are statistically significant. If differences are: at least twice as large as margin of error then there is clear difference; at least as large as margin then there is slight/apparent difference; less than/equal margin no real difference can be determined \n&gt;  \n&gt; Survey results are generally posted under embargo on Tuesday evenings with data release taking place at 1 pm ET Thursdays afterward under an appropriate title including month & year ie 01_April_30_covid_impact_survey). Data will come in comma-delimited & statistical formats containing necessary inferences regarding sample collection etc outlined within this guide  \n&gt; \n&gt;  When citing survey results these should always attributed with qualification\u2014 The Covid Impact Survey conducted by NORC at University Chicago for The Data Foundation sponsored by Federal Reserve Bank Minneapolis & Packard Foundation .  \n&gt;   Lastly more resources regarding AP\u2019s data journalism& distributions capabilities can found via link here   \tor contact kromanoap.org\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Comparing mental health outcomes of the pandemic in different states and metropolitan areas, such as rates of anxiety or loneliness.\n&gt; - Tracking changes over time in economic security measures such as employment and food security, broken down by state or city, to identify areas of need for financial assistance programs.\n&gt; - Analyzing data about communication patterns with friends and family in order to assess how individuals are adjusting their social interactions during the pandemic\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/mhoyer)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: COVID survey data codebook.csv**\n| Column name        | Description                                        |\n|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Variable**       | The name of the variable being measured.
