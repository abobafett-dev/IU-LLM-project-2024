These datasets can be found hosted on Github repositories produced daily around midnight Eastern Standard Time (EST).\n> \n> Furthermore, each aspect involved in collating this dataset including its front-end portion forming the visual facade for users - along with certain mechanical aspects responsible for generating data within given repositories work harmoniously thanks to the Congressional Tweet Automator.
