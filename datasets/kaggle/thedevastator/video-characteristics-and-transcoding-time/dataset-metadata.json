The first file consists of data for 1.6 million YouTube videos, including their ID, duration, bitrate, height and width (in pixels), frame rate, estimated frame rate, codec used, video category, and direct link to the video. This dataset provides information about consumer videos found on UGC platforms like YouTube.\n&gt; \n&gt; The second file includes information about the transcoding process for different video formats. It contains input and output video characteristics such as duration, bitrate (total and per video), height and width of the frames, actual frame rate along with its estimation value using an Intel i7-3720QM CPU. Moreover it has features like codec used in the transcoding process (input/output codecs) as categorical variables . Additionally transcoding time is included in both datasets which would be helpful while making a transcoding time prediction model in section 6.The column names are relevant enough so that understanding purpose is easier\n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; # How to Use This Dataset\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ## Overview of the Dataset\n&gt; \n&gt; The dataset consists of two TSV (Tab-Separated Values) files: youtube_videos.tsv and transcoding_mesurment.tsv. Let's take a closer look at each file:\n&gt; \n&gt; ### youtube_videos.tsv:\n&gt; \n&gt; This file contains 1.6 million randomly sampled YouTube videos with 10 fundamental video characteristics. Each row represents a unique video instance, and the columns provide information about the following characteristics:\n&gt; \n&gt; - **id:** The YouTube video ID.\n&gt; - **duration:** The duration of the video in seconds.\n&gt; - **bitrate:** The total bitrate of the video in Kbits.\n&gt; - **height:** The height of the video in pixels.\n&gt; - **width:** The width of the video in pixels.\n&gt; - **frame rate:** The actual frame rate of the video.\n&gt; - **frame rate(est.):** The estimated frame rate of the vi deo .\n&gt; - **codec:** The coding standard used for encoding th e vide o .\n&gt; - **category:**\n&gt;     - Categorical value representing YouTube vid eo categ ory .\n&gt;     - Useful for categorizing videos based on their content .\n&gt; \n&gt; ### transcoding_mesurment.tsv:\n&gt; \n&gt; This file contains additional information about input and outputvideo characteristics, transcoding time, and memory resource requirements for differentvideo formats using ffmpeg 4 as a transcoding application. Each row represents an experimental setup where two rows from youtube_videos.tsv were randomly selected as input parameters to ffmpeg's transcoding process. The columns provide information about various aspects, including:\n&gt; \n&gt; **Input Video Characteristics:**\n&gt; \n&gt; Inverse details such as (*i_size*, *p_size*, *b_size*), *frames* total number of frames in video.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Output Video Characteristics:**\n&gt; \n&gt; - **o_codec:** The output codec used for transcoding.\n&gt; - **o_bitrate:** The output bitrate used for transcoding.\n&gt; - **o_framerate:** The output frame rate used for transcoding.\n&gt; - **o_height:** The output height in pixels used for transcoding.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Transcoding Time and Memory Resource Requirements:**\n&gt; \n&gt; - **umem:** The total codec allocated memory for transcod ing .\n&gt; - **utime:** The total transcoding time in seconds.\n&gt; \n&gt; ## Potential Applications of the Dataset\n&gt; \n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Video Quality Analysis: With information about bitrate, height, width, and frame rate, this dataset can be used to analyze the quality of YouTube videos in terms of their visual characteristics. By comparing these characteristics across different categories or codecs, insights can be gained about how different factors impact video quality.\n&gt; - YouTube Video Classification: By utilizing the category information in this dataset along with other fundamental characteristics, machine learning algorithms can be trained to classify YouTube videos into different categories automatically. This could help improve content classification on platforms like YouTube and aid in recommendation systems for users\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/uci)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: transcoding_mesurment.csv**\n| Column name     | Description                                                              |\n|:----------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **duration**    | The length of the video in seconds.
