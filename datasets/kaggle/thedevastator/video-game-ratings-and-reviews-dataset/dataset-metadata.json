Enjoy analysing!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Predicting Video Game Success: Analyzing the data to identify key factors (such as release timing, platform, and initial reviews) that contribute to the success or failure of a video game. This could be used by game developers to understand what elements they should focus on in order to make their games more successful and popular.\n> - Sentiment Analysis on User Reviews: Using natural language processing techniques on user_reviews for sentiment analysis. By doing this, we can get insights into prevailing sentiments among gamers about particular games or platforms.\n> - Trend Analysis: Studying patterns in release dates, platforms, and genres over time can allow us to spot trends in the gaming industry. For instance, we could track whether certain types of games become more popular at certain times or how new technologies/platforms affect gaming preferences\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/yansian)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n> - You are free to:\n>      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n>      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n> - You must:\n>      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n>      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n>      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: all_games.csv**\n| Column name      | Description                                                                           |\n|:-----------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **name**         | The specific title of each video game.
