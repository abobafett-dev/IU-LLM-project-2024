This dataset contains valuable facets of information that bring to light various insights about the video game industry over the years. \n> \n> The dataset includes critical aspects such as the Name of each individual video game which was accounted for in this data aggregation process. The name captures the branded title under which a specific game is marketed and sold within the global market.\n> \n> Additionally, key details on numbers relating to sales are included as well; such as Global Sales which refers to the total number of copies each individual game has sold on all indicated platforms worldwide- recorded in millions; NA_Sales representing accumulated sales figures from North America- also captured in millions; JP_Sales showing similarly compiled data specifically for Japan and EU_Sales for Europe respectively, both equally reflected in millions.\n> \n> There is more insightful granularity embedded within our Dataset including Other_Sales, that tallies copies sold outside of specifically mentioned regions (North American, European & Japanese markets), expanding our insights into an even wider spectrum.\n> \n> This Dataset not only shares hard figures on sales but also valuable opinions voiced by professional critics & users alike with Critic_Count & User_Count detailing how many individuals had reviewed any specific product with Critic Score being an averaged rating given by critics while User Score echoes sentiments from regular end-users or consumers who purchased these products - showcasing public opinion on these games.  \n> \n> Critical parameters defining characteristics essential related to gaming experiences like Genre detail distinctive aspects or themes around gameplay found within respective titles while Platform lists down where these titles were played specifically (between options like PC based or console front like PS4, Xbox etc.).
