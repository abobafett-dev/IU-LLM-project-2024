It includes various vital metrics, including mortality and global health estimates, Sustainable Development goals, MDGs, child health information, infectious diseases statistics, Health financing data and more. Those looking to understand public health in France will find this extensive collection invaluable. It is also helpful for learning without borders since some of its metrics may prove applicable beyond France. This resource is highly recommended for all public health professionals seeking firsthand insights into international public health data points as an aid to their research and assessments\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This guide provides an overview of the World Health Organization (WHO) data for France, which contains health indicators for France from the World Health Organization's data portal. This dataset covers topics such as mortality and global health estimates, sustainable development goals, child health, infectious diseases, health financing, public health and environment, substance use and mental health, tobacco use and injuries violence prevention measures. \n&gt; \n&gt; Exploring this dataset can be done by filtering through the various indicators available via the GHO (display) column. Each indicator has a name associated with it that best describes what information it will provide. This lets you narrow down your search to find exactly what type of information is needed from this dataset for further analysis or comparisons with other datasets. \n&gt; \n&gt; The columns PUBLISHSTATE (display), YEAR (display), REGION(display), WORLDBANKINCOMEGROUP(dispaly), COUNTRY (dipaly) SEX(DISPLAY) provide additional criteria to filter results that allow users to focus their searches on specific criteria such as location or time frame .   Furthermore when searching by region or world bank income group there are codes associated with each country/region  so users can access specific subsets of data related to certain countries or regions in relation to a given indicator easily using these columns code values; making it easier to highlight a subset of what is available in great detail depending on specific needs without sifting through massive amounts of rows within the dataset manually.   \n&gt; \n&gt;  Once desired rows are highlighted based off relevant filters mentioned above users can get general overviews via columns such as Display Value which provides straightforward textual descriptions while Numeric column yields numerical summaries; allowing potential insight into trends amongst other things based off numberic comparison between subsets over different time frames etc... And lastly further detailed analysis can be done more precisely by altternatively looking at StdErr/StdDev column's values if more accurate statistical inferences need to be made as they determine error margins below/above displayed values accordingly providing greater detail then Display value outputs alone . Lasty if any comments exist about sets selected its higlhty advisable review them which means leveraging Comments column whcih may help explain why certian results where reported in fist place , thus helping user gain more valuable insights about underlaying data being examined .  \n&gt; \n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyzing regional health disparities in France - The data can be used to explore regional trends, identify any health disparities, and inform decision-making processes related to healthcare allocations.\n&gt; - Investigating Substance Use Trends in France - The dataset provides valuable information about substance use and mental health indicators in various regions of France, which can help researchersin studying trends related to the use of alcohol,tobacco and other substances over the years.\n&gt; - Examining Injuries Caused by Violence - With the help of this dataset, researchers can observe injury patterns due to violence related incidents throughout different parts ofFrance and employ strategies according to those findings as an effort towards decreasing violence across the country\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/humdata)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: world-health-statistics-indicators-for-france-3.csv**\n| Column name                        | Description                                                         |\n|:-----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **GHO (CODE)**                     | The Global Health Observatory code for the indicator.
