It covers various topics such as mortality, sustainable development, global health estimates, health systems, malaria and tuberculosis, child and infection diseases, public health and environment, substance use and mental health tobacco injuries and violence HIV/AIDS nutrition urban Health noncommunicable diseases financial protection medical equipment demographic socioeconomic statistics essential health technologies medical equipment insecticide resistance oral Health universal healthcare global observatory for eHealth human resources information systems youth AMR glass noncommunicable diseases mental healthcare workforce neglected tropical diseases AMR GASP ICD sexual reproductive care and many more. \n&gt; \n&gt; It provides resource descriptions that allow users to access individual indicator metadata as well as detailed coverage on different countries in the world. The dataset also includes methods related to registry interlinked with last updated information from WHO\u2019s data portal and license terms provided under a variety of other sources. \n&gt; \n&gt; The analysis of this dataset allows us to know more about the state of public healthcare in Algeria which can eventually lead us not only to an improved understanding but also better initiatives that are designed to benefit the wellbeing of citizens across this nation\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset contains a wide variety of health-related indicators for Algeria from the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) global health portal. This data can be used to gain insights into various socio-economic conditions, health systems, and public policy strategies in Algeria.\n&gt; \n&gt; ### Getting Started \n&gt; Firstly, you should download the dataset from Kaggle and unzip it into a folder of your choice. Then open the .csv file with your favorite spreadsheet or text editor application. After you have opened the dataset file, you will be able to see all of the available categories and indicator variables included in this dataset.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ### Understanding The Dataset \n&gt; The columns in this dataset are divided into two categories; GHO (Global Health Observatory) metadata fields and variable fields describing each indicator value.  The GHO metadata fields provide contextual information on where each individual healthcare indicator was sourced from including its reference year(s), geographic region/country, data source code/url and publication state code/url among others. These types of fields can be helpful when interpreting more specific results related to an entire given region or country for example. The second category includes variable fields that contain individual healthcare indicators such as mortality rates or access to clean water for example related to a specific region or population group within Algeria as well as their corresponding statistical values such as low & high values collected over a period of time etc.. Additionally it is important to note that columns with ** after them indicate labels which are relevant only if applicable e..g Low**\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\t\n&gt; ### Best Practices For Analysing Data \t\t\n&gt; When analysing this type of data consider which comparison type(s) would work best given your end goal: absolute comparison between 2+ geographies over same timeframe? Two periods compared comparatively within same geography? Or different measurements all using same base geography (ie one country)? Once you decide what type of analysis makes sense then use applicable filters/areas such as regions , provinces etc & start slicing up datasets according to whatever measure works best until desired outcomes are found e..g filter out by age groups / sex / marital status / ethnicity etc rather than downloading entire table with all stats together thereby simplifying efforts & narrowing down scope greatly improving accuracy along way whilst identifying potential must know trends quickly through visualisations generated Charts / tables when combined often highlight underlying relationships quickly which is key before analysing further Deep diving combined datasets by cross referencing various indices allowing viewers gain even better insights specially when combined structured narrative explanations composed backed up by facts\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Creating visualizations that show changes in health indicators over time for a given region, country, gender, education level, and wealth quintile \n&gt; - Identifying disparities in health outcomes between different regions, countries and socio-economic groups \n&gt; - Assessing the effectiveness of public health policies through analysis of changes in mortality and global health estimates before and after policy implementation\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/humdata)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: world-health-statistics-indicators-for-algeria-14.csv**\n| Column name                        | Description                                                         |\n|:-----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **GHO (CODE)**                     | The Global Health Observatory code for the indicator.
