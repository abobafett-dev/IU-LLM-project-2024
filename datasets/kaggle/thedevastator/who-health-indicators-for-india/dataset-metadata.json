It can be used to explore a range of topics related to health in India, including mortality and global health estimates, sustainable development goals, Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and more. \n&gt; \n&gt; To get started with this dataset, first take some time to read through the columns and familiarize yourself with the data that is available. The columns include information such as GHO code (Global Health Observatory code for the indicator), publish state, year of measurement and codes for region and country. \n&gt; \n&gt; Once you have a better understanding of what is provided in each column, then you can begin looking at trends over time or comparing various metrics across regions or countries. For example, you could compare mortality rates between different states or compare poverty rates over years within one state or region. You could also use this data to analyze progress made on particular healthcare initiatives over times by examining metrics like infant mortality rate or HIV/AIDS prevalence rates. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is also important to take notice of any disclaimers or caveats that come with using this dataset before beginning your analysis. Additionally keep an eye out for how recent the data is as it may not always reflect up-to-date statistics on current trends due to its limited scope depending on when it was gathered by WHO last updated its database - which should always be included in any discussion regarding findings based off this dataset's results\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Comparing the health outcomes of different regions in India and making informed policy decisions based on these insights. \n&gt; - Monitoring changes in indicators to measure progress towards global health goals and track improvements in public health care across the country. \n&gt; - Creating visualizations and dashboards to display information about key health indicators, such as Healthcare Expenditure, Infant Mortality Rate, or Health Coverage Indicators like Out-of-Pocket Expenditure for healthcare services\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/humdata)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: health-financing-indicators-for-india-45.csv**\n| Column name                        | Description                                                |\n|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **GHO (CODE)**                     | Global Health Observatory code for the indicator.
