It covers a wide range of topics such as Mortality and Global Health Estimates, Sustainable Development Goals, Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Health Systems, Malaria, Tuberculosis and Child health. Additionally this dataset also provides information on substance use and mental health, Injuries & violence, HIV/AIDS & STIs, Nutrition as wellas other health-related topics such as Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD), Insecticide resistance & Oral health. Furthermore it includes information on Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and Global Observatory for eHealth (GOe) from the WHO RSUD Initiative: Governance policies and financing prevention & Treatment sectors providers. It also contains sections related to human resources along with Information systems to support youth Financial protection against AMR Glass ICD Sexual Reproductive Health etc. The different columns in this dataset consists of GHO codes & displays URL's Publishing state Year Region Country Sex Display Value Numerics Low High Standard Error Standard Deviation Comments etc to provide many perspectives on public health in Ireland over time.
