Included in the dataset are categories such as Mortality, Global Health Estimates, Sustainable Development Goals, Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Public Health and Environment, Noncommunicable Diseases CCS, Neglected Tropical Diseases, Immunization and more. Through exploring this dataset you can gain valuable insights into health issues ranging from child health to infectious diseases to substance use and mental health for Turkey. Additionally this dataset is ideal for craft detailed socio-economic profiles regarding specific diseases or health-related topics. With access to information concerning essential health technologies, medical equipment, human resources availability and more; public policy research can benefit greatly from examining this data. Organizations or researchers concerned with inequalities in healthcare systems can also utilize this wealth of data to track key performance indicators or discover areas needing improved services. By leveraging these powerful aspects of the WHO Data Portal not only will decision-makers have a better understanding of effective policies but potentially lives can be saved through informed strategies that arise through analysis of  these kinds of datasets\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset contains health indicators for Turkey from the World Health Organization's data portal. It is an excellent resource for anyone researching the current state of Turkey\u2019s health indicators and it has a wide variety of topics covered such as mortality and global health estimates, sustainable development goals, infectious diseases, mental health, nutrition, urban health and more. \n&gt; \n&gt; In order to effectively use this dataset for your research you should have a basic understanding of what data is included in each field provided. For example there are fields that identify which Global Health Observatory (GHO) indicator is being measured (GHO Code), what type of indicator it is (Display Value), which region within Turkey the data applies to (Region Code), or the start year of an indicator(StartYear).  Additionally there are fields that provide extra details such as definitions (Comments) or URLs to access more information about specific indicators(GHO URL). \n&gt; \n&gt; Using this information you can easily create queries to retrieve relevant results. For example if you are looking for urban health indicators in 2019 released by WHO then you would run a query with selections based on \u201cUrban Health\u201d under GHO Display , \u201cTurkey\u201d under Country Display , \u201c2019\u201d Start Year . You can also use comparison operators such as less than/greater than (&lt;=/&gt;=) or exact match (= ) when selecting criteria values.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Lastly certain columns contain numeric values so they will require mathematical operations such as averages or percentages when calculating summary stats. Numeric fields include Low , High , StdErr , StdDev and Numeric . If an exact value associated with your query remains unknown due to missing information those field can be left blank without causing any errors. \n&gt; \n&gt; By following these general tips this dataset will provide useful insights into the current state of turkey's healthcare system- no matter what questions arise during your research journey!\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyzing overall health trends in Turkish region over time by investigating changes in outcomes of various health indicators across years. \n&gt; - Understanding socioeconomic and demographic disparities in access to healthcare resources and services by comparing data between different regions, age groups, genders and countries. \n&gt; - Comparing the levels of access to healthcare resources between Turkey and other countries by analyzing the global burden of disease child causes for each nation\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/humdata)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: icd-indicators-for-turkey-28.csv**\n| Column name                | Description                                                    |\n|:---------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **GHO (CODE)**             | The Global Health Observatory code for the indicator.
