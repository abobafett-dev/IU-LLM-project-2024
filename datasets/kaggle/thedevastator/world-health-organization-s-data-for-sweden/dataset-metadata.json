This dataset contains essential information about Sweden that aims to help people comprehend the country\u2019s current position in relation to other nations when it comes to public health and environment-related issues.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Explore various factors such as Disease Control, Demographics & Socioeconomics Statistics, Financial Protection, Mental Health and Substance Useand many more with this comprehensive collection of Swedish indicators covering both national and global data sources from WHO's portal! The data contains relevant information related to mortality rates; start and end year when the data was collected; display values for sex, region & age group codes as well as key URLs providing reference links to GHO indices or other external websites among others  - everything that you need in order to evaluate the current state of health in Sweden. \n&gt; And not only can you access pre-aggregated datasets here on Kaggle but also have access sections of individual indicator metadata for further exploration using our distinct resource descriptions! With this interactive source at your fingertips make sure you seize this opportunity now!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; \n&gt; - Access the data \u2013 The WHO Data for Sweden can be accessed by clicking on the above link in this guide or through kaggle directly.  To access the data once you have decided where to get it, download and save it to a suitable place on your device that is easy to recall later. These may include folders such as desktop, documents, or downloads folder so that you can access them easily when needed. \n&gt; \n&gt; - Explore column names \u2013 Look at what are included in each of these columns in terms of information types like string, integer or float etc., details about indicators (like coded values for gender), object codes (like GHO code), URL\u2019s related to countries and regions as applicable as per global places and standards used by organisations like WHO etc., feature types (like \u2018display value\u2019). Once you know what types of categories are available under each column name/ header, it would help understand which areas/ aspects one needs to further explore for insights through analysis using statistics tools such pandas & numpy etc; knowledge graphs & charts using libraries like matplotlib; keep track using a dashboard using Tableau online app & links etc.; fetch meaningful insights though machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn along with relevant algorithms depending upon need & loss function optimization techniques applied! \n&gt; - Organize tabulation / visualisation format: Creating visuals such tables or charts helps one better understanding between various indexing columns (x-axis/ Y-axis) vs other columns mentioned in #2 above; further exploring categorisations of variables by agegroup(s); subcategorisation by sex , region wise vs national trends along with visibilities if any relationale validations among those metrics multiple category level combination generation comapre metric performance over time period frame set based upon start year , end year possible overlay competing validations across nations establish baseline metrics from already published / shared past reports if availble look at map view alternatives for visualisations based upon population patterns demography changes evaluated over years\n&gt; \n&gt; - Utilize other sources : Online resources available which could be explored - datasets from working organisation linked with targets answered via google datastudio connected metric analysed versus potential forecast measures supported hyperlinks queries into specific KPIs gathered from forumlands managed indexed provided hints & clues attributed additional overlays hinted outcomes reflected intitiative related indices drawn creeed conclusions evidence deduction\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Visualizing health trends in Sweden over time, by region, and by gender to identify areas of improvement or concentrated areas of vulnerability.\n&gt; - Tracking poverty in Sweden and observing the correlation between poverty rate and the availability of public healthcare resources.\n&gt; - Evaluating the impact of public health initiatives like immunization programs, substance abuse prevention measures, HIV/AIDS prevention efforts etc., on health outcomes across different regions in Sweden\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/humdata)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: universal-health-coverage-indicators-for-sweden-26.csv**\n| Column name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|:---------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **GHO (CODE)**             | Unique code for each indicator.
