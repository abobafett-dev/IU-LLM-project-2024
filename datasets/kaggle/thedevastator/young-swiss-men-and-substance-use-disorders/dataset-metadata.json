This dataset can be used to understand how alcohol and drug use, mental health issues, and co-occurring addictions are interrelated in this population. Researchers can also use this valuable data to investigate the long-term effects of substance abuse and addiction in terms of their implications on health. This dataset provides a comprehensive insight into current substance abuse trends and mental health issues among young Swiss men that could prove beneficial for all related studies\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset contains data from the C-SURF study and examines the associations between self-reported alcohol use disorder and mental health problems, in the context of co-occurring addictions, among young Swiss men. By using this dataset, researchers can gain insight into alcohol and drug use, mental health problems and co-occurring addictions among young Swiss men. \n> \n> In order to make effective use of this dataset, it is important for you to understand how the data is structured and organized. The three main columns are Studer, Lemoine, and Grazioli indicating which manuscript each item relates to. These columns contain information about each individual\u2019s demographics (e.g., age), their usage patterns (e.g., frequency of substance abuse) as well as their mental health status (e.g., diagnosis). To gain insights from this dataset you should focus on evaluating relationships between different variables such as age or gender with substance abuse or addiction disorders for example; looking at differences in prevalence across particular demographic groups or analyzing relationships between certain factors associated with long term effects on health outcomes such as depression or anxiety disorders. \n> \n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Utilizing the data from this set to create an application that reminds young Swiss men of the potential harms from substance use and provides safe ways for them to cope with stressors. \n> - Using this dataset to research how socioeconomic factors and access to treatment options can influence alcohol and drug addiction among young Swiss men. \n> - Examining how mental health affects how people perceive their dependence on substances and identify healthier pathways for managing stressors in order to prevent abuse in the first place\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/3444089#.Y8Oq3dJBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
