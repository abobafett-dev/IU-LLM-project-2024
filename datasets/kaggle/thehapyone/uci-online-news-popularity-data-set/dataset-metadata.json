The goal is to predict the number of shares in social networks (popularity).\n\n### Content\n\n- The articles were published by Mashable (www.mashable.com) and their content as the rights to reproduce it belongs to them. Hence, this dataset does not share the original content but some statistics associated with it. The original content is publicly accessed and retrieved using the provided URLs.\n- Acquisition date: January 8, 2015\n- The estimated relative performance values were estimated by the authors using a Random Forest classifier and rolling windows as assessment method.. See their article for more details on how the relative performance values were set.\n\n\n### Source\n\nKelwin Fernandes (kafc \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc@\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 inesctec.pt, kelwinfc \u00e2\u20ac\u2122@\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gmail.com) - INESC TEC, Porto, Portugal/Universidade do Porto, Portugal.\nPedro Vinagre (pedro.vinagre.sousa \u00e2\u20ac\u2122@\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gmail.com) - ALGORITMI Research Centre, Universidade do Minho, Portugal\nPaulo Cortez - ALGORITMI Research Centre, Universidade do Minho, Portugal\nPedro Sernadela - Universidade de Aveiro\n\n### Attribute Information:\n\nNumber of Attributes: 61 (58 predictive attributes, 2 non-predictive, 1 goal field)\n\nAttribute Information:\n0. url: URL of the article (non-predictive)    \n1. timedelta: Days between the article publication and the dataset acquisition (non-predictive)    \n2. n_tokens_title: Number of words in the title    \n3. n_tokens_content: Number of words in the content    \n4. n_unique_tokens: Rate of unique words in the content    \n5. n_non_stop_words: Rate of non-stop words in the content    \n6. n_non_stop_unique_tokens: Rate of unique non-stop words in the content    \n7. num_hrefs: Number of links    \n8. num_self_hrefs: Number of links to other articles published by Mashable    \n9. num_imgs: Number of images    \n10. num_videos: Number of videos    \n11. average_token_length: Average length of the words in the content    \n12. num_keywords: Number of keywords in the metadata    13. data_channel_is_lifestyle: Is data channel 'Lifestyle'?    \n14. data_channel_is_entertainment: Is data channel 'Entertainment'?    \n15. data_channel_is_bus: Is data channel 'Business'?    \n16. data_channel_is_socmed: Is data channel 'Social Media'?    \n17. data_channel_is_tech: Is data channel 'Tech'?    \n18. data_channel_is_world: Is data channel 'World'?    \n19. kw_min_min: Worst keyword (min. shares)    \n20. kw_max_min: Worst keyword (max. shares)    \n21. kw_avg_min: Worst keyword (avg. shares)    \n22. kw_min_max: Best keyword (min. shares)    \n23. kw_max_max: Best keyword (max. shares)    \n24. kw_avg_max: Best keyword (avg. shares)    \n25. kw_min_avg: Avg. keyword (min. shares)    \n26. kw_max_avg: Avg. keyword (max. shares)    \n27. kw_avg_avg: Avg. keyword (avg. shares)    \n28. self_reference_min_shares: Min. shares of referenced articles in Mashable    \n29. self_reference_max_shares: Max. shares of referenced articles in Mashable    \n30. self_reference_avg_sharess: Avg. shares of referenced articles in Mashable    \n31. weekday_is_monday: Was the article published on a Monday?    \n32. weekday_is_tuesday: Was the article published on a Tuesday?    \n33. weekday_is_wednesday: Was the article published on a Wednesday?    \n34. weekday_is_thursday: Was the article published on a Thursday?    \n35. weekday_is_friday: Was the article published on a Friday?    \n36. weekday_is_saturday: Was the article published on a Saturday?    \n37. weekday_is_sunday: Was the article published on a Sunday?    \n38. is_weekend: Was the article published on the weekend?    \n39.
