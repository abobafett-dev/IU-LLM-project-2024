CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap are two of the biggest websites for monitoring both exchanges and cryptoprojects. In response to over-inflated volumes faked by crypto exchanges, both websites came up with independent metrics for assessing the worth of a given exchange. \n\n\n### Content\n\nCollected on May 10, 2020\n\nCoinGecko's data is a bit more holistic, containing metrics across a multitude of areas (you can read more in the original blog post [here](https://blog.coingecko.com/trust-score-2/). The data from CoinGecko consists of the following:\n\n-Exchange Name\n-Trust Score (on a scale of N/A-10)\n-Type (centralized/decentralized)\n-AML (risk: How well prepared are they to handle financial crime?)\n-API Coverage (Blanket Measure that includes: (1) Tickers Data (2) Historical Trades Data (3) Order Book Data (4) Candlestick/OHLC (5) WebSocket API (6) API Trading (7) Public Documentation\n-API Last Updated (When was the API last updated?)\n-Bid Ask Spread (Average buy/sell spread across all pairs)\n-Candlestick (Available/Not)\n-Combined Orderbook Percentile (See above link)\n-Estimated_Reserves (estimated holdings of major crypto)\n-Grade_Score (Overall API score)\n-Historical Data (available/not)\n-Jurisdiction Risk (risk: risk of Terrorist activity/bribery/corruption?)\n-KYC Procedures (risk: Know Your Customer?)\n-License and Authorization (risk: has exchange sought regulatory approval?)\n-Liquidity (don't confuse with \"CMC Liquidity\". THIS column is a combo of (1) Web traffic & Reported Volume (2) Order book spread (3) Trading Activity (4) Trust Score on Trading Pairs\n-Negative News (risk: any bad news?)\n-Normalized Trading Volume (Trading Volume normalized to web traffic)\n-Normalized Volume Percentile (see above blog link)\n-Orderbook (available/not)\n-Public Documentation (got well documented API available to everyone?)\n-Regulatory Compliance (risk rating from compliance perspective)\n-Regulatory last updated (last time regulatory metrics were updated)\n-Reported Trading Volume (volume as listed by the exchange)\n-Reported Normalized Trading Volume (Ratio of normalized to reported volume [0-1])\n-Sanctions (risk: risk of sanctions?)\n-Scale (based on: (1) Normalized Trading Volume Percentile (2) Normalized Order Book Depth Percentile\n-Senior Public Figure (risk: does exchange have transparent public relations? etc)\n-Tickers (tick tick tick...)\n-Trading via API (can data be traded through the API?)\n-Websocket (got websockets?)\n\n-Green Pairs (Percentage of trading pairs deemed to have good liquidity)\n-Yellow Pairs (Percentage of trading pairs deemed to have fair liquidity\n-Red Pairs (Percentage of trading pairs deemed to have poor liquidity)\n-Unknown Pairs (percentage of trading pairs that do not have sufficient order book data)\n\n~\n\nAgain, CoinMarketCap only has one metric (that was [recently updated](https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035679972) and scales from 1-1000, 1000 being very liquid and 1 not. You can go check the article out for yourself.
