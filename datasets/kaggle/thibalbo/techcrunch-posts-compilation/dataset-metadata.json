Kind of because I get to know about new startups that's coming up or maybe just because I find Tito Hamze videos fun. But TechCrunch got plenty of good content. And where we find good content we produce great exploratory analysis.\n\nThis dataset is a great opportunity for you to boost your skills as an EDA expert! It provides several features that make you able to create different analyses such as time series, clustering, predictive, segmenting, classification and tons of others. Let's not forget about word2vec for that. It would be awesome to see that in action here!\n\nI've made the scraper available on github, if you want to check it out, here is the link: [techcrunch scraper repo](https://github.com/thibalbo/techcrunch-posts-scraper)\n\n\n# Content\nThis dataset comes with a rich set of features.
