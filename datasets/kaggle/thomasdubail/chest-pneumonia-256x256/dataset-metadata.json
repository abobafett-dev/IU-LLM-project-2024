The dataset contains a total of 5,863 X-ray images in JPEG format, which are categorized into two classes: Pneumonia and Normal. These images have been used for developing an AI system for chest X-ray analysis.\n\n## Data Sources\n\nThe chest X-ray images were obtained as part of routine clinical care for pediatric patients aged one to five years. Quality control was applied to the images to remove low-quality or unreadable scans. The diagnostic labels for the images were assigned by two expert physicians, and a third expert reviewed an evaluation set to ensure diagnostic accuracy.\n\n## Data Preprocessing\n\nTo facilitate efficient model training, the dataset has undergone the following preprocessing steps:\n- Image Normalization: Images have been normalized to ensure consistent pixel values and enhance model convergence during training.\n- Image Resizing: All images have been resized to 256x256 pixels while preserving the aspect ratio.\n\n## Dataset Split\n\nThe dataset is divided into three subsets grouped by patient_id:\n- Training Set (train): Used for training the AI model.\n- Validation Set (val) : To select your model and tune hyperparameters.\n- Test Set (test): Employed to evaluate the model's performance.\n\n## Categories\n\n- Pneumonia: Chest X-ray images showing signs of pneumonia.\n- Normal: Chest X-ray images with no signs of pathology.\n\n## License\n\n[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n[https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2)\nKermany, Daniel; Zhang, Kang; Goldbaum, Michael (2018), \u201cLabeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images for Classification\u201d, Mendeley Data, V2, doi: 10.17632/rscbjbr9sj.2",
