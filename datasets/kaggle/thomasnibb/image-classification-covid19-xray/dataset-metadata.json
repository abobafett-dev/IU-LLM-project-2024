The whole world is putting incredible efforts to fight against the spread of this deadly disease. Meanwhile, hundreds of machine-learning experts volunteer their time and expertise to help medical researchers in this fight. \n\nOne of the areas where machine learning can help is detecting the COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images. The task is a simple classification problem where given an input chest X-ray image, the machine learning-based model must detect whether the subject of study has been infected or not. \n\n### Content\nThe data consists of 60 X-ray images, which are split into 30 COVID-19 subjects and 30 Normal subjects. \n\n### Acknowledgements\nThe University of Montreal for releasing the images.",
