  "descriptionNullable": "This dataset contains 30-minute resolution energy generation mixes for all 29 outward postcodes in the Leeds area between 16/02/2023 and 01/11/2023, combined with local precipitation and other weather data. Leeds has the 2nd highest Local Authority Area population in England (~900,000), with a rapidly expanding economy and population it is an important focus for authorities involved in energy generation and forecasting.\n\nThe dataset was scraped and processed from a variety of sources including the National Grid, UKCEH, and the UK Hydrology Explorer.\n\n**I had a number of motivations in creating this dataset:**\n- I was curious to see whether different areas of Leeds have different energy mixes (and consider why that is)\n- I want to visualize patterns in energy use through different timescales - sub-daily, daily, weekly and monthly/seasonal.\n- I am also curious to visualize patterns in weather through different timescales and how this links to the types of energy being produced - i.e., higher wind and sun resulting in higher wind power and solar power generation respectively.\n- As a personal challenge in scraping, processing, visualizing, and potentially modelling a relatively long high resolution time-series dataset!\n\n\n**Extra Notes**\n- There was no energy mix data for any postcode between 2023-10-20T21:30:00 and 2023-10-22T15:00:00.000000000. You must decide how to infill these values.\n- Gisburn Forest as a COSMOS weather data site is slightly outside of any Leeds postcode, although relatively close. I chose to include this was the 3rd closest to Leeds. You may decide to remove the variables from here for modelling purposes.\n- I recommend removing the extra 'pluvio' precipitation data (3 columns total), associated with the COSMOS datasets. This precipitation data seems less reliable than the UK HYdrology-collected precipitation data.\n\n**I am currently working on an EDA notebook as of 23/02/2024**\n",
