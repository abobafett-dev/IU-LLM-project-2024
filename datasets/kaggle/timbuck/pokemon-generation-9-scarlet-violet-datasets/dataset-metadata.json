And what moveset are they able to learn?\n\nThis dataset contains the stats, types, weaknesses, abilities and moves learned by all 103 new Pok\u00e9mon introduced in the Scarlet & Violet games on the Nintendo Switch. The data does not include the 4 Paldean form Pok\u00e9mon Tauros, Tauros Blaze Breed, Tauros Aqua Breed and Wooper.\n\nData was scraped from: https://serebii.net/ using R. There may be inconsistencies. One known inconsistency is that Type 1 and Type 2 values may be switched around for some Pok\u00e9mon. For example, Skeledirge is known to have Type 1 of Fire and Type 2 of Ghost, but my dataset has Type 1 as Ghost and Type 2 as Fire.\n\n# About the data\nThere are three data files:\n- gen9\\_pokemon_stats.csv\n- gen9\\_pokemon_abilities.csv\n- gen9\\_pokemon_moves.csv\n\n### gen9\\_pokemon_stats.csv\nThis file contains the Types, Stats and Weaknesses of all 103 Pok\u00e9mon.
