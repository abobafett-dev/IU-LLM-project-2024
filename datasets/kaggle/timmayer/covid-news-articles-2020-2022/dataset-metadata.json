  "descriptionNullable": "The dataset encapsulates approximately half a million news articles collected over a period of 2 years during the Coronavirus pandemic onset and surge. It consists of 3 columns - **title**, **content** and **category**. **title** refers to the headline of the news article. **content** refers to the article in itself and **category** denotes the overall context of the news article at a high level.

The dataset can be used to study the difference in behaviors of language models when there is a shift in data. For e.g., the classic transformers based BERT model was trained before the COVID era. By training a masked language model (MLM) using this dataset, we can try to differentiate the behaviors of the original BERT model vs the newly trained models.",
