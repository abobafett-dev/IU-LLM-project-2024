  "descriptionNullable": "### Content\n\nThe below description of this dataset is directly from the Chicago Department of Public Health's Food Protection Program:\n\n&gt; This information is derived from inspections of restaurants and other food\nestablishments in Chicago from January 1, 2010 to the present. Inspections are performed by\nstaff from the Chicago Department of Public Health\u2019s Food Protection Program. Inspections are\ndone using a standardized procedure. The results of the inspection are inputted into a database,\nthen reviewed and approved by a State of Illinois Licensed Environmental Health Practitioner\n(LEHP). A subset of data elements are extracted from this database and downloaded into this\ndata portal. These elements are:\n- **DBA: \u2018Doing business as.\u2019** This is legal name of the establishment.\n- **AKA: \u2018Also known as.\u2019** This is the name the public would know the establishment as.\n- **License number:** This is a unique number assigned to the establishment for the\npurposes of licensing by the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection.\n- **Type of facility:** Each establishment is described by one of the following: bakery, banquet\nhall, candy store, caterer, coffee shop, day care center (for ages less than 2), day care\ncenter (for ages 2 \u2013 6), day care center (combo, for ages less than 2 and 2 \u2013 6\ncombined), gas station, Golden Diner, grocery store, hospital, long term care\ncenter(nursing home), liquor store, mobile food dispenser, restaurant, paleteria, school,\nshelter, tavern, social club, wholesaler, or Wrigley Field Rooftop.\n- **Risk category of facility:** Each establishment is categorized as to its risk of adversely\naffecting the public\u2019s health, with 1 being the highest and 3 the lowest. The frequency of\ninspection is tied to this risk, with risk 1 establishments inspected most frequently and\nrisk 3 least frequently.\n- **Street address, city, state and zip code of facility:** This is the complete address where\nthe facility is located.\n- **Inspection date:** This is the date the inspection occurred. A particular establishment is\nlikely to have multiple inspections which are denoted by different inspection dates.\n- **Inspection type:** An inspection can be one of the following types: canvass, the most\ncommon type of inspection performed at a frequency relative to the risk of the\nestablishment; consultation, when the inspection is done at the request of the owner\nprior to the opening of the establishment; complaint, when the inspection is done in\nresponse to a complaint against the establishment; license, when the inspection is done\nas a requirement for the establishment to receive its license to operate; suspect food\npoisoning, when the inspection is done in response to one or more persons claiming to\nhave gotten ill as a result of eating at the establishment (a specific type of complaint-\nbased inspection); task-force inspection, when an inspection of a bar or tavern is done.\nRe-inspections can occur for most types of these inspections and are indicated as such.\n- **Results:** An inspection can pass, pass with conditions or fail. Establishments receiving a\n\u2018pass\u2019 were found to have no critical or serious violations (violation number 1-14 and 15-\n29, respectively). Establishments receiving a \u2018pass with conditions\u2019 were found to have\ncritical or serious violations, but these were corrected during the inspection.\nEstablishments receiving a \u2018fail\u2019 were found to have critical or serious violations that\nwere not correctable during the inspection. An establishment receiving a \u2018fail\u2019 does not\nnecessarily mean the establishment\u2019s licensed is suspended. Establishments found to\nbe out of business or not located are indicated as such.\n- **Violations:** An establishment can receive one or more of 45 distinct violations (violation\nnumbers 1-44 and 70). For each violation number listed for a given establishment, the\nrequirement the establishment must meet in order for it to NOT receive a violation is\nnoted, followed by a specific description of the findings that caused the violation to be\nissued.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nData source: [City of Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/4ijn-s7e5)\nImage source: [Dan Gold](https://unsplash.com/@danielcgold) on Unsplash\n\n### Inspiration\n\nSome ideas to investigate to help get you started:\n- Map the locations of pass/fail results using a package like `folium` or `plotly`\n- How have pass/fail rates changed over time?\n- Do different inspection types have an impact on pass/fail rates?\n- Can you create a model to predict the results based on the available information?",
