  "descriptionNullable": "# Anti Spoofing Real - Liveness Detection dataset\nThe Biometric Attack dataset consists of 98,000 videos and selfies from people from 170 countries. The videos were gathered by capturing faces of genuine individuals presenting spoofs, using facial presentations. Our dataset proposes a novel approach that learns and detects spoofing techniques, extracting features from the genuine facial images to prevent the capturing of such information by fake users. \n\nThe dataset contains images and videos of real humans with various resolutions, views, and colors, making it a comprehensive resource for researchers working on anti-spoofing technologies.\n\n### The dataset includes 2 different types of files:\n- **Photo** - a selfie of a person from a mobile phone, the person is depicted alone on it, the face is clearly visible.\n- **Video** - filmed on the front camera, on which a person moves his/her head left, right, up and down. Duration of the video is from 10 to 20 seconds.\n\n### Image\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F12421376%2F0956f7614a7de991459b5bacc8e30688%2Fanti.png?generation=1685093697311106&alt=media)\n\nThe dataset provides data to combine and apply different techniques, approaches, and models to address the challenging task of distinguishing between genuine and spoofed inputs, providing effective anti-spoofing solutions in active authentication systems. These solutions are crucial as newer devices, such as phones, have become vulnerable to spoofing attacks due to the availability of technologies that can create replays, reflections, and depths, making them susceptible to spoofing and generalization. \n\nOur dataset also explores the use of neural architectures, such as deep neural networks, to facilitate the identification of distinguishing patterns and textures in different regions of the face, increasing the accuracy and generalizability of the anti-spoofing models. \n\n# \ud83d\udcb4 For Commercial Usage: Full version of the dataset includes 50 000+ sets of files, leave a request on **[TrainingData](https://trainingdata.pro/datasets/anti-spoofing-real?utm_source=kaggle&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=anti-spoofing-live)** to buy the dataset\n\n### Metadata for the full dataset:\n- **assignment_id** - unique identifier of the media file\n- **worker_id** - unique identifier of the person\n- **age** - age of the person\n- **true_gender** - gender of the person\n- **country** - country of the person\n- **ethnicity** - ethnicity of the person\n- **video_extension** - video extensions in the dataset\n- **video_resolution** - video resolution in the dataset\n- **video_duration** - video duration in the dataset\n- **video_fps** - frames per second for video in the dataset\n- **photo_extension** - photo extensions in the dataset\n- **photo_resolution** - photo resolution in the dataset\n\n# \ud83d\udcb4 Buy the Dataset: This is just an example of the data.
