Our dataset proposes a novel approach that learns and detects spoofing techniques, extracting features from the genuine facial images to prevent the capturing of such information by fake users. \n\nThe dataset contains images and videos of real humans with various **resolutions, views, and colors**, making it a comprehensive resource for researchers working on anti-spoofing technologies.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F12421376%2F0fe0cca9d56fd2c013589667097b24b9%2Freplay.png?generation=1685095721064910&alt=media)\n\nThe dataset provides data to combine and apply different techniques, approaches, and models to address the challenging task of distinguishing between genuine and spoofed inputs, providing effective anti-spoofing solutions in active authentication systems.
