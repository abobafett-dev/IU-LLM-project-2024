All people presented in the dataset are  **South Asian, East Asian or Middle Asian**.  The dataset helps in enchancing the performance of the model by providing wider range of data for a specific ethnic group.\n\nThe videos were gathered by capturing faces of genuine individuals presenting spoofs, using facial presentations. Our dataset proposes a novel approach that learns and detects spoofing techniques, extracting features from the genuine facial images to prevent the capturing of such information by fake users. \n\nThe dataset contains images and videos of real humans with various **resolutions, views, and colors**, making it a comprehensive resource for researchers working on anti-spoofing technologies.\n\n### People in the dataset\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F12421376%2Ff545aa561432738d251c09f09e1f5e92%2FFrame%20104.png?generation=1713356643038606&alt=media)\n\n### Types of files in the dataset:\n- **photo** - selfie of the person \n- **video** - real video of the person \n\nOur dataset also explores the use of neural architectures, such as deep neural networks, to facilitate the identification of distinguishing patterns and textures in different regions of the face, increasing the accuracy and generalizability of the anti-spoofing models. \n\n# \ud83d\udcb4 For Commercial Usage: Full version of the dataset includes 30,600 files, leave a request on **[TrainingData](https://trainingdata.pro/datasets/anti-spoofing-real/?utm_source=kaggle&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=asian-people-liveness-detection)** to buy the dataset\n\n### Metadata for the full dataset:\n- **assignment_id** - unique identifier of the media file\n- **worker_id** - unique identifier of the person\n- **age** - age of the person\n- **true_gender** - gender of the person\n- **country** - country of the person\n- **ethnicity** - ethnicity of the person\n- **video_extension** - video extensions in the dataset\n- **video_resolution** - video resolution in the dataset\n- **video_duration** - video duration in the dataset\n- **video_fps** - frames per second for video in the dataset\n- **photo_extension** - photo extensions in the dataset\n- **photo_resolution** - photo resolution in the dataset\n\n### Statistics for the dataset\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F12421376%2F6de78d350a9213d8437f766b085d4551%2Fasian_video_liveness.png?generation=1713356627116331&alt=media)\n\n# \ud83d\udcb4 Buy the Dataset: This is just an example of the data.
