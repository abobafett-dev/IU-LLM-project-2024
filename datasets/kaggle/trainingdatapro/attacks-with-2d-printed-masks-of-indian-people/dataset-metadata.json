It allows for the development of algorithms and models that can effectively detect attacks perpetrated by individuals wearing printed 2D masks.\n\nThe dataset comprises videos of genuine facial presentations using various methods, including 2D masks and printed photos, as well as real and spoof faces. It proposes a novel approach that learns and extracts facial features to prevent spoofing attacks, based on deep neural networks and advanced biometric techniques. \n\nOur results show that this technology works effectively in securing most applications and prevents unauthorized access by distinguishing between genuine and spoofed inputs. Additionally, it addresses the challenging task of identifying unseen spoofing cues, making it one of the most effective techniques in the field of anti-spoofing research.\n\n# \ud83d\udcb4 Buy the Dataset: This is just an example of the data.
