  "descriptionNullable": "# Liveness Detection - Video Classification\n\n# The dataset is created on the basis of [Anti Spoofing Real Dataset](https://trainingdata.pro/datasets/anti-spoofing-real?utm_source=kaggle&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=display-spoof) and [Antispoofing Replay Dataset](https://trainingdata.pro/datasets/anti-spoofing-replay?utm_source=kaggle&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=display-spoof)\n\nThe biometric attack dataset with **replay attacks** on the real videos of people. **Replay attack** involves presenting a pre-recorded video or previously captured footage as if it were occurring in real-time. \nThe primary objective is to distinguish between genuine, real-time footage and manipulated recordings. \n\nThe videos were gathered by capturing faces of genuine individuals presenting spoofs, using facial presentations. Our dataset proposes a novel approach that learns and detects spoofing techniques, extracting features from the genuine facial images to prevent the capturing of such information by fake users. \n\nThe dataset contains videos of real humans with various **resolutions, views, and colors**, making it a comprehensive resource for researchers working on anti-spoofing technologies.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F12421376%2Fdf8dfb5e5a0a49c53802a3c1885699a3%2F2-ezgif.com-optimize.gif?generation=1707825966570185&alt=media)\n\nThe dataset provides data to combine and apply different techniques, approaches, and models to address the challenging task of distinguishing between genuine and spoofed inputs, providing effective anti-spoofing solutions in active authentication systems.
