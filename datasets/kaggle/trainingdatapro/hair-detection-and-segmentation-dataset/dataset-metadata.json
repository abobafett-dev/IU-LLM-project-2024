  "descriptionNullable": "# Hair Detection & Segmentation Dataset\n\nThe dataset consists of images of people for detection and segmentation of hairs within the oval region of the face. It primarily focuses on identifying the presence of hair strands within the facial area and accurately segmenting them for further analysis or applications.\n\nThe dataset contains a diverse collection of images depicting people with different *hair styles, colors, lengths, and textures*.  Each image is annotated with annotations that indicate the boundaries and contours of the individual hair strands within the oval of the face.\n\n# \ud83d\udcb4 For Commercial Usage: To discuss your requirements, learn about the price and buy the dataset, leave a request on **[TrainingData](https://trainingdata.pro/datasets?utm_source=kaggle&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=hair-detection-and-segmentation-dataset)** to buy the dataset\n\nThe dataset can be utilized for various purposes, such as developing machine learning models or algorithms for hair detection and segmentation. It can also be used for research in facial recognition, virtual try-on applications, hairstyle recommendation systems, and other related areas.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F12421376%2F81b5a9e6c755e04d97fc6b175a127432%2FMacBook%20Air%20-%201.png?generation=1691561622573906&alt=media)\n\n## SIMILAR DATASETS:\n- **[Bald People Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trainingdatapro/bald-people-segmentation-dataset)**\n- **[Dataset of bald people, 5000 images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tapakah68/dataset-of-bald-people)**\n- **[Body Segmentation - 5,300 Photos](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trainingdatapro/human-segmentation-dataset)**\n- **[Selfies, ID Images dataset (5591 sets of 15 files)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tapakah68/selfies-id-images-dataset)**\n- **[Face segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tapakah68/face-segmentation)**\n\n# Dataset structure\n- **images** - contains of original images of people\n- **masks** - includes segmentation masks for the original images\n- **collages** - includes original images with colored hairs within the oval of the face\n-  **annotations.xml** -  contains coordinates of the bounding boxes and labels, created for the original photo\n\n# Data Format\n\nEach image from `images` folder is accompanied by an XML-annotation in the `annotations.xml` file indicating the coordinates of the bounding boxes and labels for parking spaces.
