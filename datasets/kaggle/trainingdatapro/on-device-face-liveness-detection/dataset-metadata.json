  "descriptionNullable": "# Mobile Face Liveness Detection - Phone Attack Dataset\n\nThe biometric attack dataset consists of videos featuring individuals wearing various types of masks. Videos are recorded under **different lighting conditions** and with **different attributes** (*glasses, masks, hats, hoods, wigs, and mustaches for men*).\n\nIn the phone attack dataset dataset, there are **4 types of videos** filmed on mobile devices:\n\n- **2D mask with holes for eyes** - demonstration of an attack with a paper/cardboard mask (*mask*)\n- **2D mask with holes for eyes, nose, and mouth** - demonstration of an attack with a paper/cardboard mask with cutouts for the nose and mouth (*mask_cut*)\n- **2D mask** - demonstration of an attack with a paper/cardboard silhouette (*outline*)\n- **Real Video** - demonstration of a real person's face (*real*)\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F12421376%2Fa987634cc73688e8bae895a22486ab0e%2FFrame%2058.png?generation=1700553110330831&alt=media)\n\nThe dataset comprises videos of genuine facial presentations using various methods, including 2D masks and printed photos, as well as real and spoof faces. It proposes a novel approach that learns and extracts facial features to prevent spoofing attacks, based on deep neural networks and advanced biometric techniques. \n\nOur results show that this technology works effectively in securing most applications and prevents unauthorized access by distinguishing between genuine and spoofed inputs.
