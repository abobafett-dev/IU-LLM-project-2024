  "descriptionNullable": "# Silicone Masks Biometric Attack Dataset\nThe anti spoofing dataset consists of videos of individuals and attacks with printed 2D masks and silicone masks . Videos are filmed in different lightning conditions (*in a dark room, daylight, light room and nightlight*). Dataset includes videos of people with different attributes (*glasses, mask, hat, hood, wigs and mustaches for men*).\n\nThe dataset comprises videos of genuine facial presentations using various methods, including 3D masks and photos, as well as real and spoof faces. It proposes a novel approach that learns and extracts facial features to prevent spoofing attacks, based on deep neural networks and advanced biometric techniques. \n\nOur results show that this technology works effectively in securing most applications and prevents unauthorized access by distinguishing between genuine and spoofed inputs. Additionally, it addresses the challenging task of identifying unseen spoofing cues, making it one of the most effective techniques in the field of anti-spoofing research.\n\n# \ud83d\udcb4 For Commercial Usage: Full version of the dataset includes 5792 videos, leave a request on **[TrainingData](https://trainingdata.pro/datasets?utm_source=kaggle&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=silicone-masks-biometric-attacks)** to buy the dataset\n\n### Types of videos in the dataset:\n- **real** - real video of the person \n- **outline** -video of the person wearing a printed 2D mask\n- **silicone** - video of the person wearing a silicone mask\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F12421376%2Ff9be1f70a38085709c85716b212cdd11%2FFrame%2027.png?generation=1696329340111093&alt=media)\n\n### Types and number of videos in the full dataset:\n- **2885** real videos of people\n- **2859** videos of people wearing silicone mask\n- **48** videos of people wearing a 2D mask.\n\n### Gender of people in the dataset:\n- women: **2685**\n- men: **3107**\n\nThe dataset serves as a valuable resource for computer vision, anti-spoofing tasks, video analysis, and security systems.
