  "descriptionNullable": "# Spine MRI Dataset, Fracture Detection & Segmentation\n\nThe dataset consists of .dcm files containing **MRI scans of the spine** of the person with several dystrophic changes, such as osteophytes, focal mass in the Th7 vertebral body, fluid mass on the anterior contour of the Th7 vertebra, dorsal protrusion of the Th11-Th12 disc and spondyloarthrosis. The images are **labeled** by the doctors and accompanied by **report** in PDF-format. \n\nThe dataset includes 5 studies, made from the different angles which provide a comprehensive understanding of a several dystrophic changes and useful in training spine anomaly classification algorithms.
