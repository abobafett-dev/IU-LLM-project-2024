  "descriptionNullable": "# Spine MRI Dataset, Fracture Detection & Segmentation\n\nThe dataset consists of .dcm files containing **MRI scans of the spine** of the person with several dystrophic changes, such as changes in the shape of the spine, osteophytes, disc protrusions, intracerebral lesions, hydromyelia, spondyloarthrosis and spondylosis, anatomical narrowness of the spinal canal and asymmetry of the vertebral arteries. The images are **labeled** by the doctors and accompanied by **report** in PDF-format. \n\nThe dataset includes 5 studies, made from the different angles which provide a comprehensive understanding of a several dystrophic changes and useful in training spine anomaly classification algorithms.
