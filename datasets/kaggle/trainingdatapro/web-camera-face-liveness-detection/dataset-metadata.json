  "descriptionNullable": "# Web Camera Face Liveness Detection - Anti Spoofing Dataset\n\nThe biometric attack dataset consists of videos featuring individuals wearing various types of masks. Videos are recorded under **different lighting conditions** and with **different attributes** (*glasses, masks, hats, hoods, wigs, and mustaches for men*).\n\nIn the dataset, there are **7 types of videos** filmed on a web camera:\n\n- **Silicone Mask** - demonstration of a silicone mask attack (*silicone*)\n- **2D mask with holes for eyes** - demonstration of an attack with a paper/cardboard mask (*mask*)\n- **2D mask** - demonstration of an attack with a paper/cardboard silhouette (*outline*)\n- **Monitor Replay Attack** - demonstration of an attack from a monitor (*monitor *)\n- **A4 Photo Attack** - demonstration of a paper/cardboard A4 photo attack (*print*)\n- **A4 Photo with holes for eyes, nose and mouth** - demonstration of a paper/cardboard A4 photo attack with cutouts for the eyes, nose, and mouth (*print_cut*)\n- **Real Video** - demonstration of a real person's face (*real*)\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F12421376%2F87e1747ec7c320f55d668d18396d9c4f%2FFrame%2062.png?generation=1700568627549534&alt=media)\n\nThe dataset comprises videos of genuine facial presentations using various methods, including 2D masks and printed photos, as well as real and spoof faces. It proposes a novel approach that learns and extracts facial features to prevent spoofing attacks, based on deep neural networks and advanced biometric techniques. \n\nOur results show that this technology works effectively in securing most applications and prevents unauthorized access by distinguishing between genuine and spoofed inputs.
