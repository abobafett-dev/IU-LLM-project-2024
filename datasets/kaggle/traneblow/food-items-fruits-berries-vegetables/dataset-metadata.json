  "descriptionNullable": "Introducing the most complete publicly available dataset of fruits, vegetables, and berries. I have attempted to classify every fruit and berry that I have discovered in my life. However, vegetables are not fully complete. Fruits and berries were captured with a Europe-Asian bias. Nonetheless, I am still thrilled to share this dataset with the public, as I have carefully curated it over the course of 12 months. As an enthusiast of image classification, I created this dataset as part of my personal project with the dream of building a mobile app that would allow users to log any meal with one-snap calculated calories.\n\nThis particular dataset is the second of many that I plan to publish, each featuring various meal items that I have meticulously curated for the most detailed calorie calculation possible.\n\nTo create this dataset, I utilized a custom-created mobile app on my iPhone 13-14 Pro Max to capture images. I took great care to ensure that each image was taken from different angles and under varying lighting conditions to provide the most detailed and comprehensive visual representation of each item. I faced challenges with existing apps that were unable to detect meals in my custom neon home lighting, which was one of the reasons why I started working on my own dataset. Additionally, I made a conscious effort to order and select food based on the needs of my dataset, ensuring that each item was thoroughly documented.\n\nIn addition to my own pictures, this dataset includes user-generated images sourced from friends, fellow food enthusiasts, and the internet. Each picture was manually classified multiple times by myself and carefully scraped from different sources to ensure accuracy and consistency in the dataset.\n\nI poured my heart and soul into this dataset, making it the project of my life. I had planned to collect pictures for the next 10 years until I started experiencing an eating disorder. As a result, I have decided to make this dataset public in the hopes of sharing my past work for the greater good of the data science community.\n\nOverall, I am proud to share this dataset with public, and I am excited to continue creating and sharing more datasets featuring various meal items in the future.\n\nYou can always contact me directly to obtain additional nutrition datasets that I have not yet classified or published. Pictures in my datasets mostly made with the goal of image classification, but also include numerous pictures of various dishes to make object detection possible. I have approximately 20 GB of manually prepared food photos.",
