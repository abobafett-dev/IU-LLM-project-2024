And in my exploration of previous Pokemon datasets, I've come across many different ways to add data to enrich this dataset, as simple as teaming up with 6 vs 6 Pokemon against each other.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset has a total of 4 csv files. 2 files (`combat.csv` and `pokemon.csv`) of which I referenced from this dataset . The other 2 files I created from an idea model: 6 vs 6 team match.\n\nI trained my classifier Random Forest machine learning model for predicting which Pokemon will win in a match. The model has worked very well on the training set, it has an accuracy rate of `94%` on the test set, more details I will leave in the kernel in the `Code` section.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe wouldn't be here without the help of others.\nThanks for this dataset https://www.kaggle.com/terminus7/pokemon-challenge dataset for the `combat.csv` and `pokemon.csv`.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nSince the questioning process is the first step for any data science project, you may want to ask a few questions before you begin analyzing the set.\nIt's may be:\n- Which one is the strongest Pokemon?\n- Which Pokemon has the highest win rate?\n- Which Pokemon team has the highest win rate?\n- Which Machine Learning model is best suit for predict a Pokemon is legendary or not?\nLet curiosity take over you.\n\n### Disclaimer\nThis is not an official data set from the Pokemon manufacturer, the team battle data files are created by myself from highly accurate machine learning models on the test set.",
