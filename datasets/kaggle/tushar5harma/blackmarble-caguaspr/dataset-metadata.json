For example, in the case of [Hurricane Maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria), satellite imagery can be used to identify which areas were hit the hardest and which economic activities were most affected by the hurricane. This information can then be used to prioritize aid and recovery efforts, and to better understand the long-term economic impact of the disaster.\n\nIn addition to natural disasters, satellite imagery can also be used to track changes in economic activity due to other factors such as changes in government policies, shifts in market conditions, or technological innovations. By tracking changes in economic activity over time, analysts can identify emerging trends and patterns, and use this information to make more informed decisions about investment, planning, and resource allocation.\n\n# **\u2728 Content**\nThe dataset have a directory named \"Data_PR\" which contains 117 files of data saved in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF). Each file corresponds to a specific date, and contains data on the night-time lights in Caguas, Puerto Rico. It provides information on economic activities in Caguas, PR before and after the hurricane, and can be used to track changes in those activities over time.\n\n# **\u2728 Implementation Sectors**\n\n- **Time-series Analysis**: The dataset can be used to train models to predict changes in economic activity over time. This can be used to identify patterns and trends in economic activity, and to forecast economic growth or decline.\n\n- **Image Analysis**: The dataset contains satellite images of the night-time lights in Caguas, which can be used to train models to identify patterns and changes in economic activity. This information can be used to track changes in economic activity over time, and to identify areas where economic growth or decline is occurring.\n\n- **Anomaly Detection**: The dataset can be used to train models to identify anomalies in economic activity, such as sudden drops in activity due to a natural disaster. This information can be used to trigger automated responses, such as alerts to emergency services or aid organizations.\n\n# **\u2728 Practical Use Cases**\n\n- **Disaster Response**: The dataset can be used to track economic activity in a region before and after a disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake. This information can be used to assess the impact of the disaster on the region and prioritize aid and recovery efforts.\n\n- **Urban Planning**: The dataset can be used to identify patterns in economic activity in a city or region over time. This information can be used by urban planners to identify areas of economic growth and decline, and to plan infrastructure and transportation projects accordingly.\n\n- **Environmental Monitoring**: The dataset can be used to monitor changes in the night-time light patterns of a region over time. This information can be used to track changes in energy use and carbon emissions, and to identify areas where energy efficiency improvements can be made.",
