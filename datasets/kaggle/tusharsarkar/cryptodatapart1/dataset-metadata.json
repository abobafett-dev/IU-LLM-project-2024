So I wanted to understand more about it and this post helped me get started. Once the basics are done, the data scientist inside me started raising questions like:\n\nHow many cryptocurrencies are there and what are their prices and valuations?\nWhy is there a sudden surge in the interest in recent days?\nSo what next?\nNow that we have the price data, I wanted to dig a little more about the factors affecting the price of coins. I started of with Bitcoin and there are quite a few parameters which affect the price of Bitcoin. Thanks to Blockchain Info, I was able to get quite a few parameters on once in two day basis.\n\nThis will help understand the other factors related to Bitcoin price and also help one make future predictions in a better way than just using the historical price.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset has one csv file for each currency. Price history is available on a daily basis from April 28, 2013. This dataset has the historical price information of some of the top crypto currencies by market capitalization.\n\nDate : date of observation\nOpen : Opening price on the given day\nHigh : Highest price on the given day\nLow : Lowest price on the given day\nClose : Closing price on the given day\nVolume : Volume of transactions on the given day\n",
