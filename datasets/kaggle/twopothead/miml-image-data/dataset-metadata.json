The dataset contains 2000 natural scenes images.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe image data set consists of 2,000 natural scene images, where a set of labels is artificially assigned to each image. \nThe following table gives the detailed description of the number of images associated with different label sets, where all the possible class labels are desert, mountains, sea, sunset and trees. The number of images belonging to more than one class (e.g. sea+sunset) comprises over 22% of the data set, many combined classes (e.g. mountains+sunset +trees) are extremely rare. On average, each image is associated with 1.24 class labels.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe wouldn't be here without the help of others. Credits for this dataset go to Z.-H. Zhou from NJU LAMDA.
