An application may wish to automatically mute the sound during commercials and then later unmuting it when the normal broadcast returns from commercial break.\n\n\n### Method\n\nUsing FFMPEG, IPTV video streams of news channels were recorded at various times of the day and on different days of the week. The commercials were then cut out of each recording and saved as a separate mp4 file. After separating the commercials from the normal broadcasts, frames were taken from each of the recordings and organized by their category. Data was separated into training and validation sets for convenience and to prevent nearly identical frames being included in both the training and validation data. Videos used to make frames for the train folder were never used to make frames for the validation folder and vice-versa.\n\nSo far, the following fourteen categories exist with plans to add additional channels in the future:\n- fox_business\n- the\\_weather\\_channel\n- cbsn\n- fox_news\n- cnn\n- espn\n- msnbc\n- commercials/the\\_weather\\_channel\n- commercials/cbsn\n- commercials/fox_news\n- commercials/cnn\n- commercials/espn\n- commercials/msnbc\n- commercials/fox_business\n\n\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- Each frame is exactly 1280x720.\n- 512x512 scaled images are also provided\n- The quality of the frames may vary due to the resolution being automatically scaled.\n- Some frames are more pixelated than others.\n- Some of the recordings were taken at the same time as other recordings and there is some overlap in the live news events being covered by each channel.\n- Some frames may appear to be duplicates as a result of capturing one frame per-second.\n- Manually verified that no commercials frames are included in any of the channel directories and vice versa.
