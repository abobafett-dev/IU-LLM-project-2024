The second dataset is richer because it contains information on faculty departments/colleges; however, it contains less rows due to how we chose to join this data.\n1. `salaries_without_dept.csv` contains all of the data we extracted from the PDFs. The four columns are: Year, Faculty Name, Primary Job Title, and Base Pay. There are 47,479 rows.\n2. `salaries_final.csv` contains the same columns as [1], but also joins with data about the faculty's \"Department\" and \"College\" (for a total of six columns). There are only 14,470 rows in this dataset because we removed rows for which we could not identify the Department/College of the faculty.\n\n# Data collection\nAll data is publicly available on the University of Vermont [website](https://www.uvm.edu/). I downloaded all PDFs from https://www.uvm.edu/oir/faculty-and-staff. Then I used a Python package (Camelot) to parse the tabular PDFs and used regex matching to ensure data was correctly parsed. I performed some initial cleaning (removed dollar signs from monetary values, etc.). At this stage, I saved the data to `salaries_without_dept.csv`. \n\nI also wanted to know what department and college each faculty belonged to. I used http://catalogue.uvm.edu/undergraduate/faculty/fulltime (plus Python's lxml package to parse the HTML) to determine \"Department\" and then manually built an encoding to map \"Department\" to \"College\". Note that this link provides faculty information for 2020, thus after joining we end up only with faculty that are still employed as of 2020 (this should be taken into consideration). Secondly, this link does not include UVM administration (and possibly some other personnel) so they are not present in this dataset. Thirdly, there were several different ways names were reported (sometimes even the same person has their name reported differently in different years). We tried joining first on LastName+FirstName and then on LastName+FirstInitial but did not bother using middle name. To handle ambiguity, we removed duplicates (e.g. we removed Martin, Jacob and Martin, Jacob William as they were not distinguishable by our criteria). The joined data is available in `salaries_final.csv`. \n\nNote: perhaps \"College\" was not the best naming, since faculty of UVM Libraries and other miscellaneous fields are included. \n\n## Data dictionary\nThe column definitions are self-explanatory, but the \"College\" abbreviation meanings are unclear to a non-UVM-affiliate. We've included `data_dictionary.csv` to explain what each \"College\" abbreviation means. You can use this dictionary to filter out miscellaneous \"colleges\" (e.g. UVM Libraries) and only include colleges within the undergraduate program (e.g. filter out College of Medicine).\n\n# Uses\nDespite there only being a few (six) columns, I think this is quite a rich dataset and could also be paired with other UVM data or combined with data from other universities. This dataset is mainly for data analytics and exploratory data analysis (EDA), but perhaps it could also be used for forecasting (however, there's only 12 time values so you'd probably want to make use of \"College\" or \"Primary Job Title\"). Interesting EDA questions could be: \n1. \"Are the faculty in arts & humanities departments being paid less?\" This news article -- [UVM to eliminate 23 programs in the College of Arts and Sciences](https://vtdigger.org/2020/12/03/uvm-to-eliminate-23-programs-in-the-college-of-arts-and-sciences/) -- suggests so. Give a quantitative answer.  \n2. \"Are lecturers declining in quantity and pay?\" This news article -- [\u2018I\u2019m going to miss this:\u2019 Three cut lecturers reflect on time at UVM](https://vtcynic.com/news/the-faces-behind-the-cuts-three-lecturers-reflect-on-time-at-uvm/?fbclid=IwAR0zCp-QyYIGCTswAswmytUtfsxguECQPlepLy-4etDJHvIcPNTm2YoXPCk) -- suggests so. Give a quantitative answer.\n3. \"How does the College of Medicine compare to the undergraduate colleges in terms of number of faculty and pay?\" See `data_dictionay.csv` for which colleges are in the undergraduate program.\n4. \"How long does it take for a faculty member to become a full professor?\" Yes, this is also answerable from the data because Primary Job Title updates when a faculty member is promoted.\n\n# Future updates\nI do not plan to maintain this dataset. If I get the chance, I may update it with future year salaries. ",
