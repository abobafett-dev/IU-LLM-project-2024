(Dawn, Morning, Afternoon or Night)\n     - Dawn: 00:00 - 06:00 hrs\n     - Mornings: 07:00 - 12:00 hrs\n     - Afternoon: 13:00 - 18:00 hrs\n     - Night: 19:00 - 23:59 hrs\n   \n**3. Evolution of E-commerce orders in the Brazil region:**\n    - Get the month on month no. of orders placed in each state.\n    - How are the customers distributed across all the states?\n**4. Impact on Economy: Analyze the money movement by e-commerce by looking at order prices, freight and others.**\n    - Get the % increase in the cost of orders from year 2017 to 2018 (include months between Jan to Aug only).\n    - Calculate the Total & Average value of order price for each state.\n    - Calculate the Total & Average value of order freight for each state.\n**5. Analysis based on sales, freight and delivery time.**\n   - Find the no. of days taken to deliver each order from the order\u2019s purchase date as delivery time.\nAlso, calculate the difference (in days) between the estimated & actual delivery date of an order.\nDo this in a single query.\n\nYou can calculate the delivery time and the difference between the estimated & actual delivery date using the given formula:\n    **- time_to_deliver** = order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp\n   **- diff_estimated_delivery** = order_delivered_customer_date - order_estimated_delivery_date\n    - Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average freight value.\n    - Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average delivery time.\n    - Find out the top 5 states where the order delivery is really fast as compared to the estimated date of delivery.You can use the difference between the averages of actual & estimated delivery date to figure out how fast the delivery was for each state.\n\n**6. Analysis based on the payments:**\n- Find the month on month no. of orders placed using different payment types.\n- Find the no. of orders placed on the basis of the payment installments that have been paid.\n",

(Dawn, Morning, Afternoon or Night)\n     - Dawn: 00:00 - 06:00 hrs\n     - Mornings: 07:00 - 12:00 hrs\n     - Afternoon: 13:00 - 18:00 hrs\n     - Night: 19:00 - 23:59 hrs\n   \n**3. Evolution of E-commerce orders in the Brazil region:**\n    - Get the month on month no. of orders placed in each state.\n    - How are the customers distributed across all the states?\n**4. Impact on Economy: Analyze the money movement by e-commerce by looking at order prices, freight and others.**\n    - Get the % increase in the cost of orders from year 2017 to 2018 (include months between Jan to Aug only).\n    - Calculate the Total & Average value of order price for each state.\n    - Calculate the Total & Average value of order freight for each state.\n**5. Analysis based on sales, freight and delivery time.**\n   - Find the no. of days taken to deliver each order from the order\u2019s purchase date as delivery time.\nAlso, calculate the difference (in days) between the estimated & actual delivery date of an order.\nDo this in a single query.\n\nYou can calculate the delivery time and the difference between the estimated & actual delivery date using the given formula:\n    **- time_to_deliver** = order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp\n   **- diff_estimated_delivery** = order_delivered_customer_date - order_estimated_delivery_date\n    - Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average freight value.\n    - Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average delivery time.\n    - Find out the top 5 states where the order delivery is really fast as compared to the estimated date of delivery.You can use the difference between the averages of actual & estimated delivery date to figure out how fast the delivery was for each state.\n\n**6. Analysis based on the payments:**\n- Find the month on month no. of orders placed using different payment types.\n- Find the no. of orders placed on the basis of the payment installments that have been paid.\n",
