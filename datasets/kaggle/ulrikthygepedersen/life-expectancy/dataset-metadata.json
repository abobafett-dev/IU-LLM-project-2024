  "descriptionNullable": "Life expectancy is a key measure of a population's health and well-being. It is defined as the average number of years that a newborn is expected to live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth remain constant throughout its life. Life expectancy is influenced by a variety of factors, including access to healthcare, lifestyle factors, and socioeconomic status.\n\nThe life expectancy per country dataset provides a comprehensive overview of the life expectancy of each country. The dataset includes information on life expectancy at birth, covering all countries in the world. It is compiled from various sources, including national statistical agencies, the World Health Organization (WHO), and other relevant data sources.\n\nThe life expectancy per country dataset can be used by researchers, policymakers, and the general public to gain insight into the health status of different populations and to compare the relative levels of life expectancy across the world. It can also be used to monitor changes in life expectancy over time and to evaluate the effectiveness of healthcare policies and strategies.\n\nOverall, the life expectancy per country dataset is an important resource for understanding the health of populations around the world and for developing policies and strategies that promote better health outcomes and increased life expectancy for all.",
