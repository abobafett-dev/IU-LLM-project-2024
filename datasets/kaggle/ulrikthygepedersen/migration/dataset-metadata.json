  "descriptionNullable": "Migration is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has significant social, economic, and political implications. Net migration, which is the difference between the number of people entering and leaving a country, is an important measure of the movement of people across borders. Net migration can be influenced by a variety of factors, including economic opportunities, political stability, social networks, and cultural ties.\n\nThe net migration per country dataset provides a comprehensive overview of the net migration of each country. The dataset includes information on the number of immigrants, emigrants, and net migration, covering all countries in the world. It is compiled from various sources, including national statistical agencies, international organizations such as the United Nations (UN), and other relevant data sources.\n\nThe net migration per country dataset can be used by researchers, policymakers, and the general public to gain insight into the patterns and trends of migration across the world and to compare the relative levels of migration across different countries and regions. It can also be used to monitor changes in migration patterns over time and to evaluate the effectiveness of migration policies and strategies.\n\nOverall, the net migration per country dataset is an important resource for understanding the dynamics of migration and for developing policies and strategies that promote safe, orderly, and regular migration for the benefit of migrants, sending countries, and receiving countries alike.",
