  "descriptionNullable": "Population is a key indicator of the size and growth of a country's economy and society. The population of a country can influence a range of economic, social, and political factors, including resource availability, demographic trends, and political representation. Accurate and up-to-date population data is essential for effective policy planning and decision-making.\n\nThe population numbers per country dataset provides a comprehensive overview of the population of each country. The dataset includes information on the total population, population density, population growth rates, and other related metrics, covering all countries in the world. It is compiled from various sources, including national statistical agencies, the United Nations Population Division, and other relevant data sources.\n\nThe population numbers per country dataset can be used by researchers, policymakers, and the general public to gain insight into the size and growth of different populations and to compare the relative levels of population across the world. It can also be used to monitor changes in population size and demographic trends over time and to evaluate the effectiveness of policies and strategies aimed at managing population growth and promoting sustainable development.\n\nOverall, the population numbers per country dataset is an important resource for understanding the dynamics of population growth and for developing policies and strategies that promote sustainable economic and social development for all.",
