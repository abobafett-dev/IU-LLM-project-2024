To the best of our knowledge, MU-SSiD is first publicly available visual-range sea state image dataset. \n\nFrom February 2020 to April 2021, ten data collection experiments were conducted at five different offshore and onshore locations in West Malaysia.

Five sea states were identified in the raw data. However, after data preprocessing and quality checks, four sea states were finalized for the final dataset development. Various image augmentation techniques were evaluated, and the suitable label-preserving augmentations were applied to the source images.
