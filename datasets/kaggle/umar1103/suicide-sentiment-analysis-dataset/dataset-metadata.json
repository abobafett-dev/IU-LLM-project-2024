  "descriptionNullable": "# Suicide Sentiment Analysis Dataset\n\n## Description\n\nThis dataset, named **Suicide Sentiment Analysis Dataset**, is a comprehensive collection of textual data labeled for sentiment analysis related to suicide and depression. It was utilized in the research titled \"Enhanced Feature Engineering Approach for Suicidal Risk Identification (EFASRI)\" published in the Egyptian Informatics Journal.\n\nThe dataset is designed to support the development of machine learning models for identifying suicidal risk levels in social media posts. It contains labeled data that can be used for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and mental health research.\n\n### Research Paper\n\nThe dataset was used in the following research publication:\n- **Title:** Enhanced Feature Engineering Approach for Suicidal Risk Identification (EFASRI)\n- **Authors:** Umar Hajam, Syed Tanzeel Rabani, Akib Mohi Ud Din Khanday, Qamar Rayees Khan, Ali Shariq Imran, Zenun Kastrati.\n- **Publication:** Egyptian Informatics Journal\n- **Date:** April 19, 2023\n- **Link:** [Enhanced Feature Engineering Approach for Suicidal Risk Identification (EFASRI)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110866523000233)\n\n### Contents\n\nThe dataset is organized into the following structure:\n\n- **Negative_Neutral_Depression (Directory):**\n  - **Depression.csv:** Contains textual data labeled as \"Depression\".\n  - **Neutral.csv:** Contains textual data labeled as \"Neutral\".\n  - **Suicidal_tendencies_data.csv:** Contains textual data labeled with suicidal tendencies.\n\n- **Pos_Neut_Neg.csv (File):**\n  - Contains textual data labeled with Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiments.\n\n### Usage\n\nThis dataset is ideal for:\n- Training and evaluating models related to suicide risk detection.\n- Sentiment analysis in social media posts.\n- Mental health research focusing on identifying signs of depression and suicidal tendencies.\n\nResearchers and developers are encouraged to utilize this dataset to advance the state of technology in mental health and sentiment analysis, contributing to the development of better tools and resources for identifying and mitigating suicidal behavior.\n\n### License\n\nThis dataset is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.
