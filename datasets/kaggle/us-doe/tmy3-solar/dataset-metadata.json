  "descriptionNullable": "The TMY3s are data sets of hourly values of solar radiation and meteorological elements for a 1-year period. Their intended use is for computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and building systems to facilitate performance comparisons of different system types, configurations, and locations in the United States and its territories. Because they represent typical rather than extreme conditions, they are not suited for designing systems to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location.\n\nPlease note that TMY3 is NOT the state of the art solar data.  It was used as a key component of investment analyses for several years, but NREL has released a more recent version based on satellite data and updated meteorological models that provides coverage for the entire United States. [That dataset][1] is much too large to publish here, but is highly recommended if you need the best information.\n\n### Content\n\n- Please see the pdf manual for full details of each field; there are several dozen of them. \n- It's important to know that nearly all of the solar data is modeled based on estimates of cloud cover; less than 1% of the stations directly measured sunlight.\n- This data is not appropriate for time series analysis. A typical meteorological year is literally twelve months of real data from twelve different years.
