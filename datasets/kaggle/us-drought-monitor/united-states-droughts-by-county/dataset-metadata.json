  "descriptionNullable": "The [United States Drought Monitor](http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Home.aspx) collects weekly data on drought conditions around the U.S.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nAll data was downloaded from the [United States Drought Monitor webpage](http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Home.aspx).\n\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor is jointly produced by the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Map courtesy of NDMC-UNL.\n\n## The Data\n\nThe data contains weekly observations about the extent and severity of drought in each county of the United States. The dataset contains the following fields:\n\n- **releaseDate**: when this data was released on the USDM website\n- **FIPS**: the FIPS code for this county\n- **county**: the county name\n- **state**: the state the county is in\n- **NONE**: percentage of the county that is *not in drought*\n- **D0**: percentage of the county that is in *abnormally dry conditions*\n- **D1**: percentage of the county that is in *moderate drought*\n- **D2**: percentage of the county that is in *severe drought*\n- **D3**: percentage of the county that is in *extreme drought*\n- **D4**: percentage of the county that is in *exceptional drought*\n- **validStart**: the starting date of the week that these observations represent\n- **validEnd**: the ending date of the week that these observations represent\n- **domStatisticFormatID**: seems to always be 1\n\n**Note:** the drought categories are cumulative: if an area is in D3, then it is also in D2, D1, and D0. This means that, for every observation, D4 <= D3 <= D2 <= D1 <= D0.\n\n### County Info\n\nTo make some analyses slightly easier, I've also included *county_info_2016.csv*, which contains physical size information about each county. This file contains the following fields:\n\n- **USPS**: \tUnited States Postal Service State Abbreviation\n- **GEOID**: \tFIPS code\n- **ANSICODE**: \tAmerican National Standards Institute code\n- **NAME**: \tName\n- **ALAND**: \tLand Area (square meters) - Created for statistical purposes only\n- **AWATER**: \tWater Area (square meters) - Created for statistical purposes only\n- **ALAND_SQMI**: \tLand Area (square miles) - Created for statistical purposes only\n- **AWATER_SQMI**: \tWater Area (square miles) - Created for statistical purposes only\n- **INTPTLAT**: \tLatitude (decimal degrees) First character is blank or \"-\" denoting North or South latitude respectively\n- **INTPTLONG**: \tLongitude (decimal degrees) First character is blank or \"-\" denoting East or West longitude respectively",
