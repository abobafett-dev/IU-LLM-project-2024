Log GDP per capita** is in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjusted to a constant 2017 international dollars, taken from the World Development Indicators (WDI) by the World Bank (version 17, metadata last updated on January 22, 2023). See Statistical Appendix 1 for more details. GDP data for 2022 are not yet available, so we extend the GDP time series from 2021 to 2022 using country-specific forecasts of real GDP growth from the OECD Economic Outlook No. 112 (November 2022) or, if missing, from the World Bank\u2019s Global Economic Prospects (last updated: January 10, 2023), after adjustment for population growth. The equation uses the natural log of GDP per capita, as this form fits the data significantly better than GDP per capita.\n**2.** The time series for **Healthy life expectancy at birth** is constructed based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository, with data available for 2005, 2010, 2015, 2016, and 2019. To match this report\u2019s sample period (2005-2022), interpolation and extrapolation are used. See Statistical Appendix 1 for more details.\n**3. Social support (0-1)** is the national average of the binary responses (0=no, 1=yes) to the Gallup World Poll (GWP) question \u201cIf you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?\u201d\n**4. Freedom to make life choices (0-1)** is the national average of binary responses to the GWP question \u201cAre you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?\u201d\n**5. Generosity** is the residual of regressing the national average of GWP responses to the donation question \u201cHave you donated money to a charity in the past month?\u201d on log GDP per capita.\n**6. Perceptions of corruption (0-1)** are the average of binary answers to two GWP questions: \u201cIs corruption widespread throughout the government or not?\u201d and \u201cIs corruption widespread within businesses or not?\u201d Where data for government corruption are missing, the perception of business corruption is used as the overall corruption perception measure.\n**7. Positive affect** is defined as the average of previous-day effects measures for laughter, enjoyment, and interest. The inclusion of interest (first added for World Happiness Report 2022), gives us three components in each of positive and negative affect, and slightly improves the equation fit in column 4. The general form for the affect questions is: Did you experience the following feelings during a lot of the day yesterday?\n**8. Negative affect** is defined as the average of previous-day effects measures for worry, sadness, and anger.\n\nThe World Happiness Report is a publication of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, powered by the Gallup World Poll data. The World Happiness Report reflects a worldwide demand for more attention to happiness and well-being as criteria for government policy. It reviews the state of happiness in the world today and shows how the science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.\n\nLife evaluations from the Gallup World Poll provide the basis for the annual happiness rankings. They are based on answers to the main life evaluation question. The Cantril ladder asks respondents to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on a 0 to 10 scale. The rankings are from nationally representative samples over three years.\n\nWe use observed data on the six variables and estimates of their associations with life evaluations to explain the variation across countries. They include GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption. Our happiness rankings are not based on any index of these six factors \u2013 the scores are instead based on individuals\u2019 own assessments of their lives, in particular, their answers to the single-item Cantril ladder life-evaluation question, much as epidemiologists estimate the extent to which life expectancy is affected by factors such as smoking, exercise, and diet.\n\nThe World Happiness Report and much of the growing international interest in happiness exist thanks to Bhutan. They sponsored Resolution 65/309, \u201cHappiness: Towards a holistic approach to development,\u201d adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 19 July 2011, inviting national governments to \u201cgive more importance to happiness and well-being in determining how to achieve and measure social and economic development.\u201d\n\nOn 2 April 2012, chaired by Prime Minister Jigmi Y. Thinley and Jeffrey D.
