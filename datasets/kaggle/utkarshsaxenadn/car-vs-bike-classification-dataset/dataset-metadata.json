  "descriptionNullable": "This **data set** is a collection of ***2,000*** **Bike** and **Car images**. While collecting these images, It was made sure that **all types of bikes and cars** are included in the **image collection**. This is because of the **high Intra-variety of cars and bikes**. That is, there are different types of cars and bikes, which make it a **little tough task** for the model because the model will also have to understand the **high variety of bikes and cars**. But if your model is **able to understand** the **basic structure** of a **car** and a **bike**, it will be able to **distinguish between both classes**. \n\nThe data is **not preprocessed**. This is **done intentionally** so that **you can apply the augmentations** you want to use. Almost all the **2000 images are unique**. So after applying some **data augmentation**, you can increase the **size of the data set**.\n\nThe data is **not distributed into training** and **validation subsets**. But you can easily do so by using an **Image data generator** from **Keras**. The preprocessing steps are available in the **my notebook associated with this data set**. You can practice your computer vision skills using this data set. This is a **binary classification task**.",
