  "descriptionNullable": "---\n# Version 2\n\nVersion 2 extends the version 1 of the fastfood classification data set and introduces some new classes with new images. These new classes are : \n* **Baked Potato**\n* **Crispy Chicken**\n* **Fries**\n* **Taco**\n* **Taquito**\n\nThe data set is **divided into 4 parts**, the **Tensorflow Records**, **Training Data**Validation Data** and **Testing Data**.\nThe tensorflow records directory is further **divided into 3 parts**, the **Train**, **Valid** and **Test**. These images are **resized to 256 by 256 pixels**. No other augmentation is applied. While loading the tensorflow records files, **you can apply any augmentation you want**.\n\n  * **Train** : Contains **15,000** training images, with each class having **1,500 images**.\n\n  * **Valid** : Contains **3,500** validation images, with each class having **400 images**.\n\n  * **Test** : Contains **1,500** validation images, with each class having **100/200 images**.\n\n* Unlike the **Tensorflow records data**, the **Training data, validation data and testing data** contains **direct images**. These are raw images. So **any kind of augmentation**, and specially **resizing**, can be applied on them. \n\n  * **Training Data** : This directory contains **5 subdirectories**. Each **directory representing a class**. Each **class have 1,500 training images**.\n\n * **Validation Data** : This directory also contains **10 subdirectories**.
