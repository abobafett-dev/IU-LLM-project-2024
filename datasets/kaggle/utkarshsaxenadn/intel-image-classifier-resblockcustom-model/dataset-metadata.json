  "descriptionNullable": "This is a **custom model** based on a **residual block** which is based on **residual learning**. The model achieved an **accuracy of 70%** in just **10 epochs**, which is **remarkable**, considering in mind that the **model is trained from scratch**, and the model architecture is extremely simple with just **one single layer**. Intentionally, the model did not consist of a single layer, but it was too powerful that it started over-fitting the data. The model consists of **convolutional layers**, some **batch normalization layers**, and a **skip connection**. \n\nI highly recommend you to **try this model**. Try out **your own variations**, This is just the **version one** of this model in future it will be **updated**.\n\n---\n**DeepNets**",
