The main idea here is of Transfer Learning, this model is pre-trained on a Large Dataset, so it can be trained on sub-datasets or basically other small datasets and as the model is pre-trained on a Very large Dataset it is expected that it will perform extremely well on the small dataset. There are 3 variants of BiT :\n\n* BiT-L : This is trained on Image Classification task of 300M Samples(This is Private).\n* BiT-M : This is trained on Image Classification task of 14M Samples.\n* BiT-S : This is trained on Image Classification task of 1.3M Samples.\n\nHere, the model is trained on monkey species dataset. The model achieved 95% accuracy on training, testing and validation data.",
