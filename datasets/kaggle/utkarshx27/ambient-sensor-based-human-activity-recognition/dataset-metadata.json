  "descriptionNullable": "#### Read the entire description all the way through.\n- Data Set Characteristics: Multivariate, Sequential, Time-Series\n- This dataset represents ambient data collected in homes with volunteer residents. Data are collected continuously while residents perform their normal routines.\n- Ambient PIR motion sensors, door/temperature sensors, and light switch sensors are placed throughout the home of the volunteer. The sensors are placed in locations throughout the home that are related to specific activates of daily living that we wish to capture.\n- The classification task is to predict the activity that is occurring in the smart home and being observed by the ambient sensors. The sensors communicate using the ZigBee Pro protocol, forming a mesh network with all battery powered sensors as leaf nodes and always-on devices (light switches and ZigBee relays) forming the branches that connect back to the USB gateway on our local SHiB [2] server.\n- The original format captured from the sensors is provided, as well as the feature vector we generate using a sliding window of 30 sensor events. Each annotated data file (ex: csh101/csh101.ann.txt) has a corresponding feature vector CSV file (ex: csh101/csh101.ann.features.csv). Most of the sensor data files contain labels for two months of the collection period, though some contain labels for extended time periods.\n- We have also included the entire dataset collected at each smart home in the original format (ex: csh101/csh101.rawdata.txt) and the generated feature vector CSV file (ex: csh101/csh101.rawdata.features.csv).\n- An analysis of the attributes for each features CSV file is found in the corresponding readme (ex: csh101/csh101.ann.features.csv is described by csh101/csh101.ann.features.README.txt).\n- The smart home layout, and sensor placement from the original formats is found in the included sensor map for each smart home (ex: csh101/csh101.sensor_map.png).\n\n## The original format is:\n- is YYYY-MM-DD, in local time.\n- is HH:[Web Link], 24-hour and in local time.\n- is the name of the sensor, this can be found on the sensor map.\n- is the room-level sensor location.\n- is more detailed, usually identifying what in the room the sensor\nis aimed at or sensing.\n- is the message generated by the sensor (we define these in more detail\nbelow).\n- is the type of sensor generating the event, so you know what to\nexpect for a message. In these earlier smart homes many of the sensors could\nbe identified by their name, but in later configurations you had to use this\nfield to identify what sensor was sending the message.\n## Motion Sensor Package\nEach motion sensor package contains a PIR motion detector and a resistive photocell\nlight sensor. The package also reports it's battery level and regularly checks\nin with the sensor network (ZigBee Check-Ins).\n## Control4-Motion and Control4-MotionArea\nMost motion sensors have a sticker in the lens that limits what it can see\nto approximately a 3-foot diameter circle when mounted on the ceiling facing\ndown. Some motion sensors that do not have any sticker limiting their view\nare called Control4-MotionArea and can detect motion within view, though\nsensitivity to smaller body movements may be reduced beyond 20 feet.\n## Message Values\nMotion and Motion Area sensors always report ON or OFF.\n## Frequency\nThe sensor will instantly send an ON message when detecting motion.\n1.25 seconds after it no longer observes motion the sensor will send OFF.\n-- Control4-LightSensor\n-- Message Values\nThe light sensor will send integer values ranging from 0 to 100 (pitch\nblack to very bright). The Motion sensors with stickers in the lens have\na much more limited amount of light that hits the sensor, and may only\nobserve a range from 0 to 10, with a rare spike to a much higher value\nwhen the lid is removed to replace a battery.\n## Frequency\nThe current light level is bit-packed and sent with every message the\npackage sends on ZigBee, but the light sensor itself can initiate a ZigBee\nmessage if the value changes by 15% from the last value it reported.\n-- Control4-BatteryPercent\n-- Message Values\nThe battery percent is always an integer ranging from 0 to 100.\n## Frequency\nThe battery levels are only allowed to report once every 6 hours, but\nonly report when there is a change. This means that some battery values\nmay not be updated for days as the level has not changed.\n-- Control4-Radio\nThese sensor messages were enabled when we upgraded our data collection systems\naround 2014.\n-- Message Values\nThe ZigBee radio check-in always has the same message, OK.\n## Frequency\nThe ZigBee radio checks in with the network about once every 30 minutes.\nA sudden lack of radio check-ins may indicate this sensor's battery has\ndied or there is some interference disrupting communication on the ZigBee\nnetwork.\n-- Door Sensor Package\n-- Control4-Door\n-- Message Values\nThe door sensor always report OPEN or CLOSE.\n## Frequency\nThe sensor sends the message as soon as the magnetic reed switch changes.\n-- Control4-Temperature\nAll door sensor packages have an internal temporature sensor, and the ability\nto attach a second temperature probe. This was used in some of the bathrooms\nfor measuring the temperature at the door and right next to the shower.\n-- Message Values\nMessages are a decimal in Celsius with 0.5 degrees Celsius accuracy.\n## Frequency\nMessages are sent when the sensor detects a change in the measured\ntemperature by 0.5 Celsius.\n-- Control4-BatteryPercent\n-- Message Values\nThe battery percent is always an integer ranging from 0 to 100.\n## Frequency\nThe battery levels are only allowed to report once every 6 hours, but\nonly report when there is a change. This means that some battery values\nmay not be updated for days as the level has not changed.\n-- Control4-Radio\n-- Message Values\nThe ZigBee radio check-in always has the same message, OK.\n## Frequency\nThe ZigBee radio checks in with the network about once every 30 minutes.\nA sudden lack of radio check-ins may indicate this sensor's battery has\ndied or there is some interference disrupting communication on the ZigBee\nnetwork.\n-- Light Switch Package\n-- Control4-Light\n-- Message Values\nLight switch messages are integer values ranging from 0 to 100. Some of\nthe lights are dimmers, they report the change in value from 0 to 100 as\nthey ramp up their brightness. The switches simply report 0 or 100 when\nthey turn off or on.\n## Frequency\nThe light switches only report light messages when the value changes.\n-- Control4-Button\nWith the data collection upgrade in 2014 we were able to start collecting\nsensor events from residents interacting with the light switches.\n-- Message Values\nThe buttons have a variety of messages they send. TAP is sent every time\nthe button is pressed. When the button is doing being tapped, the button\nwill send TAP_COUNT_01 if the button was tapped once (we have observed\ntap counts as high as 12, but do not know the limit of the device).\nOn the dimmer light switches there are also the DEPRESS and RELEASE messages\nthat are sent then the button is held down to slowly dim the light up\nor down.\n## Frequency\nMessages are only sent with a participant interacts with the button.\n-- Control4-Radio\n-- Message Values\nThe ZigBee radio check-in always has the same message, OK.\n## Frequency\nThe ZigBee radio checks in with the network about once every 15 minutes.\nA sudden lack of radio check-ins may indicate this sensor's battery has\ndied or there is some interference disrupting communication on the ZigBee\nnetwork.\n\n# Attribute Information:\n\nThis has a full breakdown for each file in the zip.\n7.
