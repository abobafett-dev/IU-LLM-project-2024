There are two types of models: small text models (indicated by names starting with 'st'), which were trained on the **[Russian reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laytsw/reviews)**, and large text models (indicated by names starting with 'lt'), which were trained on Russian news articles dataset from this **[competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sentiment-analysis-in-russian/data)**.\n\nPlease feel free to use and upvote this dataset. The source code for training and testing these models will be made available soon!",
