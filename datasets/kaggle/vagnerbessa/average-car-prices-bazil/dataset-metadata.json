  "descriptionNullable": "# Average car price in Brazil\n\n## Abou the data\n\n*Data extracted from [FIPE](https://veiculos.fipe.org.br/).*\n\nEvery observation (row) corresponds to a average car price, calculated to a month of a year of reference. In other words, in a year (`year_of_reference`) there are 12 observations related to the same car, however `avg_price_brl` might differ.\n\nThe variables `fuel`, `gear` and `engine_size` were extracted from values of column `model`, as in original there is no column dedicated to those values. Since some values for *model* don't contain the information of engine size, this dataset doesn't contain the whole data from FIPE's original. Additionally, if 'Aut.' is not present in `model`, the car is assumed to be manual.\n\nThe prices are calculated by FIPE and they're here as original (in BRL).\n\nFIPE updates the information on a monthly basis. Here, the referred month is given as `month_of_reference`,  as the corresponding year has variable named as  `year_of_reference`\n\nThe FIPE codes (`fipe_codes`) are the model identifier used in FIPE webpage.\n\n## Variables\n\n- `year_of_reference`: year of reference of the observation, i.e., the year the data corresponds to.\n- `moth_of_reference`: month of reference of the observation, i.e., the month the data corresponds to. The average price is calculated by FIPE each month.\n- `fipe_code`: unique id corresponding to a model for easy search on FIPE webpage.\n- `authentication`: unique code that authenticates the consult in FIPE's site.\n- `brand`: car's make.\n- `model`: a description of the car containing the name and other descriptive information, as provided in FIPE table.\n- `fuel`: fuel used by the car. Some of gas cars are actually alcohol and gas (totalflex), which is common in Brazil.\n- `gear`: the way gears are shifted.\n- `engine_size`: Engine size measured in cubic centimeters.\n- `year_model`: those values corresponds to the year of reference, and may not be the same of the year of manufacture, which in case will corresponds to a year before `year_model`. Observations with `year_model` = `year_of_reference` mean the car is brand new for that year of reference, i.e., a 2021 car with `year_of_reference` = 2021 and `moth_of_reference` = July mean that the observation (mainly the average price) corresponds to a brand new car in the year of 2021, of the month of July. The same model may have a different average price for different month. \n- `avg_price_brl`: average car's price, as measured by FIPE, in BRL.\n-  (variable deleted in Version 2).\n- \n\n## Questions\n\nHere are some questions that may be used as starting point of analysis.\n\n- How average prices depend on car's age?\n- How the engine size contribute to the average price?\n- Can FIPE's prices be used to predict car prices?\n- Gather some data from real stores. Can you compute you own average? How's it different from FIPE's?\n- Build a time series and make explore them accordingly to engine size and gear type.\n- Scale prices with Brazil's minimum wage in order make analysis period wise.` ",
