Transformed the Data using some image processing techniques and convert it to 32,32 pixel black and white images.\n3. Created the Data set for special character ( @, #, $, & )\n4. Merged the Categories to avoid the misclassification \n5. Total 39 Categories in Train and Validation set\n\n\n### Content\n\n1. The Data set contains all the English alphabets  (small and caps), digits (0-9) and some special characters ( @, #, $, & )\n2. The images are 32 by 32 pixel black and white images\n3. There are total 39 categories 26 for Alphabets  (small and caps letters are combined to create a single class of each character), 9 for Digits (i.e. 1 to 9 ). to avoid mis-classification digit 0 is combined in character O category. and some special characters ( @, #, $, &).\n4.  Please refer the github page for trained Model using CNN and Convolution Scripts fro training.\nhttps://github.com/VaibhavKhamgaonkar/OCR  \n\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks a Lot Vijayalaxmi Rohane for helping me out for creating the Dataset.\n\n\n### Inspiration\nJust wanted to create a good dataset for everyone who wants to create something related to hand written text. i.e. Build an OCR or any other sort of application. I have created model which is around 92.7% accurate which is open sourced on my github account.\nhttps://github.com/VaibhavKhamgaonkar/OCR",
