So I went to HassAvocadoBoard website and downloaded the data from 2018 (again) to 2021 for better comparisons :)\n\nIt represents the sales of 3 different types of avocado in the U.S based on varieties, total volume, average price, region\n\nI formatted everything in a table so it should be fine. Careful though, even though the data is categorized by cities, but also regions (midlands, west etc), one region is \"TOTAL U.S\" so that can cause errors in the data.\n\nAs I'd mentioned, this data was inspired by the \"Avocado Prices\" made by Justin Kiggins.\nI hope you like it :) it is a great tool to practice some sparkSQL, R and even Python.",
