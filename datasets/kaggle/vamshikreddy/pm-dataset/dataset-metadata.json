  "descriptionNullable": "Deep learning has proven to show superior performance in certain domains such as object recognition and image classification. It has also gained popularity in domains such as finance where time-series data plays an important role. Predictive Maintenance is also a domain where data is collected over time to monitor the state of an asset with the goal of finding patterns to predict failures which can also benefit from certain deep learning algorithms. Among the deep learning methods, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks are especially appealing to the predictive maintenance domain due to the fact that they are very good at learning from sequences. This fact lends itself to their applications using time series data by making it possible to look back for longer periods of time to detect failure patterns. In this notebook, we build an LSTM network for the data set and scenerio described at Predictive Maintenance Template to predict remaining useful life of aircraft engines. In summary, the template uses simulated aircraft sensor values to predict when an aircraft engine will fail in the future so that maintenance can be planned in advance.\n\n\nDescribing the dataset\n\nThe dataset consists of sensor readings from a fleet of simulated aircraft gas turbine engines operating conditions as a multiple multivariate time series. The dataset consists of separate training and test sets. The testset is similar to the training set, except that each engine\u2019s measurements are truncated some (unknown) amount of time before it fails. The data is provided as a ZIP-compressed text file with 26 columns of numbers. Each row represents a snapshot of data taken during a single operational cycle and each column represents a different variable. Datasets taken from Microsoft Azure.",
