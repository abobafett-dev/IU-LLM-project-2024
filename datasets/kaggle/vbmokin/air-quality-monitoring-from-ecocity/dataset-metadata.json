  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nThe dataset contains data from public monitoring of air quality in Ukraine (for Vinnytsia city and region - population: 1 575 808, square: 26513 sq. km).\n\n\n### Content\n\nMany stations monitor air quality day and night according to the following indicators: \n\n* pm1 - PM1.0 (dust particles with a size of 1 \u03bcm), mkg/cub.m\n* pm25 - PM2.5 (dust particles with a size of 2.5 \u03bcm), mkg/cub.m\n* pm10 - PM10 (dust particles with a size of 10 \u03bcm), mkg/cub.m\n* CO2 - carbon dioxide, mkg/cub.m\n* temperature - temperature, in degrees Celsius\n* humidity - Humidity, %\n* pressure - Pressure, pascals (Pa)\n\nIn some stations, there may be additional indicators.\n\nThe stations belong to the monitoring network [\"Eco-City\"](https://eco-city.org.ua/).\nData are measured at intervals of 15 seconds to several minutes (145 seconds or more). Sometimes longer periods of time are possible, due to power outages and/or communications.\n\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nI thank service [\"Eco-City\"](https://eco-city.org.ua/) for the opportunity to download data.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nIt is interesting to solve the following problems, which are typical for other cities and regions around the world:\n1. Analyze the basic patterns of data change in the city or regions as a whole and for each station separately (seasonality, anomalies, etc.).\n2. Forecast data for the following dates, which is easy to check for new data from service [\"Eco-City\"](https://eco-city.org.ua/). New data in the dataset will be updated periodically.\n3. Forecast the data for the current day. For comparison, they can be downloaded from service [\"Eco-City\"](https://eco-city.org.ua/) via API.\n4. Compare public monitoring data with state monitoring data available through API.\n\nI will prepare baseline notebooks to solve these problems and invite others to improve them.",
