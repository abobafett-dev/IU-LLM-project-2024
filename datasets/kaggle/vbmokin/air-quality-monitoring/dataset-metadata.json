Sometimes longer periods of time are possible, due to power outages and/or communications.\n\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank service [\"SaveEcoBot\"](https://www.saveecobot.com/) for the opportunity to download data in CSV format and monitoring networks [\"Eco-City\"](https://eco-city.org.ua/), [\"Luftdaten.info\"](https://luftdaten.info/) and [\"SaveDnipro\"](https://www.savednipro.org/) for the provided data, as well as - thank you to the owners of the stations themselves who bought them at their own expense.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nIt is interesting to solve the following problems, which are typical for other cities around the world:\n1. Analyze the basic patterns of data change in the city as a whole and for each station separately (seasonality, anomalies, etc.).\n2. Forecast data for the following dates, which is easy to check for new data from service [\"SaveEcoBot\"](https://www.saveecobot.com/). New data in the dataset will be updated periodically.\n3. Forecast the data for the current day. For comparison, they can be downloaded from service [\"SaveEcoBot\"](https://www.saveecobot.com/) via API.\n4. Compare public monitoring data with state monitoring data available through API.\n\nI will prepare baseline notebooks to solve these problems and invite others to improve them.",
