A pneumothorax occurs when air leaks into the space between your lung and chest wall. This air pushes on the outside of your lung and makes it collapse. Pneumothorax can be a complete lung collapse or a collapse of only a portion of the lung.*\n\n*A pneumothorax can be caused by a blunt or penetrating chest injury, certain medical procedures, or damage from underlying lung disease. Or it may occur for no obvious reason. Symptoms usually include sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. On some occasions, a collapsed lung can be a life-threatening event.*\n\n\n*Treatment for a pneumothorax usually involves inserting a needle or chest tube between the ribs to remove the excess air. However, a small pneumothorax may heal on its own.*\n\n\n~ quote from [mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumothorax/symptoms-causes/syc-20350367)\n\n\n### Content\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F1086574%2F68c88d76baf627a9a403b966d1238f01%2Fdatasetimage.png?generation=1577978354713777&alt=media)\n\nThis dataset contains 12,047 chest x-ray images and 12,047 pneumothorax masks.
