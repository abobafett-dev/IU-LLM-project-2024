This hybrid approach helps maintain the authenticity and reliability of the dataset.\n\n-Scalability: Generating synthetic data allows researchers to scale their datasets quickly. This is particularly beneficial for training machine learning models, which often require large volumes of data to perform effectively. The scalable nature of synthetic data generation ensures that datasets can be expanded without compromising privacy or ethical standards.\n\n-Scenario Simulation: Synthetic data can be used to simulate a wide range of mental health scenarios that may be underrepresented or rare in real-world data. This enables researchers to study and develop solutions for less common conditions, enhancing the overall understanding and treatment options in the mental health domain.\n\n-Cost-Effectiveness: Collecting real mental health data can be time-consuming and expensive. Synthetic data generation reduces these costs by providing an alternative means of obtaining data, allowing resources to be allocated more efficiently.",
