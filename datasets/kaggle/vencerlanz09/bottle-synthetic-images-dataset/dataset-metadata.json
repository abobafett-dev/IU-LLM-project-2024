The download files contain 5000 Images for each classes of bottles available. Currently there are five classes available: `Plastic Bottles` , `Beer Bottles`, `Soda Bottles`, `Water Bottles`, and `Wine Bottles`. I will try to add more bottle types in the future.\n\n## Update\nPreviously, the dataset only contains images of plastic bottles and beer bottles. Now I've included images of soda, water, and wine bottles also. I will be adding more images in the future. **You could always check the previous versions of the dataset if you want to retrieve the previous directory**. Cheers! :D",
