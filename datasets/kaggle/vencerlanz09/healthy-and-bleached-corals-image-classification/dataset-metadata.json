  "descriptionNullable": "# Healthy and Bleached Corals Image Classification Dataset\n\nThis dataset is specifically curated for the classification of healthy and bleached corals. It contains a total of 923 images collected from Flickr using the Flickr API. These images are categorized into two distinct classes: healthy corals (438 images) and bleached corals (485 images). The images have been resized to a maximum of 300 pixels for either width or height, whichever is higher, to maintain a consistent size across the dataset.\n\nThe primary purpose of this dataset is to assist researchers, data scientists, and machine learning enthusiasts in developing and evaluating classification models to differentiate between healthy and bleached corals. This dataset can be employed to train various machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to recognize and distinguish the visual patterns associated with healthy and bleached corals.\n\nBy creating accurate classification models, researchers and marine biologists can better understand the health and well-being of coral reefs, monitor changes in their environment, and contribute to the conservation and restoration of these vital ecosystems.\n\n## Dataset Details\n\n- **Total images**: 923\n- **Image categories**: 2\n    - **Healthy corals**: 438 images\n    - **Bleached corals**: 485 images\n- **Image format**: JPEG\n- **Image size**: Maximum 300 px for either width or height, whichever is higher\n- **Source**: Flickr API\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Flickr and its users for providing the images used in this dataset. Additionally, we express our gratitude to the marine biology and environmental conservation communities for their ongoing efforts to study and preserve coral reefs.\n",
