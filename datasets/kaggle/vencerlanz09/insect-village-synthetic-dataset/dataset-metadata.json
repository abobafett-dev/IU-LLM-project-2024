The dataset in the folder `Insect Classes` contains 1000 synthetic images for each insect class. You may choose to adjust this as preferred. For the test data, you may use your own photos or videos. On the other hand, the dataset in the `ImageClassesCombinedWithCOCOAnnotations` Folder contains merged versions of the classes together with the COCO Annotations and the test images.\n\n## Similar dataset\n* [Sea Animals Image Dataset\ud83c\udf0a](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vencerlanz09/sea-animals-image-dataste)\n\n\n### Current available insect classes\n* Bees\n* Beetles\n* Butterflies\n* Cicada\n* Dragonflies\n* Grasshoppers\n* Moths\n* Scorpions\n* Snails\n* Spiders\n\n\n## Update\nAs per version 5 of the dataset, I've added the Insect Classes directory which contains 1000 synthetic images of ten insect classes.
