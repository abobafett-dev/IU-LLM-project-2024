The annotations are in the COCO format. There is also a sample test_image.jpg but you could also use your own or split the data if you prefer. Foreground images are taken from free stock image sites like unsplash.com, pexels.com, and pixabay.com.

The dataset can be used to train a CNN model for image detection and segmentation tasks in domains like agriculture, recycling, and many more.",
