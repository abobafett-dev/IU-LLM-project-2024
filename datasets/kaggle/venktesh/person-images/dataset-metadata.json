Primary purpose of this dataset is dog breed classification.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\nI came across this dataset through udacity's nanodegree program. Thanks to udacity's program and project that enabled me to ask and answer many questions with this dataset.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI am also attaching my kernel which answers question like the breed  the dog image belongs too using a CNN from scratch and transfer learning. Alternative questions that could be asked are how the face detector can be made resilient to adversarial attacks etc.",
