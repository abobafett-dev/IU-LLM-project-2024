  "descriptionNullable": "Depression, also known as major depressive disorder, is a prevalent and serious medical condition that profoundly impacts a person's emotions, cognition, and behavior. It ranks among the most commonly diagnosed mental health disorders and is often accompanied by anxiety. Our dataset originates from the DepSign-LT-EDI@ACL2022 contest dataset, and we have applied various preprocessing techniques to refine it. These techniques involve converting the text to lowercase, stemming, removing stopwords, and notably, summarizing the content. The text summarization process aims to limit the document length (max_length) to less than 512 words, as language models generally perform better when working with shorter inputs. This limitation not only facilitates model training but also improves performance evaluation and yields better results on the test set.\n\nThe dataset comprises three files:\n- File **train.csv**: This file contains 6006 samples, each labeled with one of three categories: 0 for severe depression, 1 for moderate depression, and 2 for no depression. It is used for training the model.\n- File **dev.csv**: With 1000 samples, this file follows the same three-label structure as train.csv. It serves as the validation set during the model training process.\n- File **test.csv**: This file contains 3245 samples, each labeled with the same three categories as the previous files. It is used to assess the effectiveness of our trained mode\n",
