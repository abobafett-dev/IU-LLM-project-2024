The photographs were taken during traveling across Russia. They captured many variations, distortions, and defects. This dataset was developed for the object detection task, so it contains bounding boxes and labels (road sign types). \n\nUsing this detection dataset, we generated a segmentation dataset. The mask was generated based on the road sign type. There are 156 road sign types of 8 super-classes, there are only 5 basic shapes: ellipse, rectangle, triangle, reversed triangle, and diamond. The resulting mask was obtained by fitting the corresponding shape into the bounding box. The size of a single image is 1280x720 pixels. \n\nWe used in it our research \"Keypoint-based Static Object Removal from Photographs\", which will be soon available online.\n\n### Content\n\nEach *.jpg image file has a corresponding *.json  file which contains the mask for road sign on it.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\nShakhuro and Konushin - for the original dataset.\n\nAlexander Volkov - for making it a segmentation dataset.\n\n### Inspiration\n\n",
