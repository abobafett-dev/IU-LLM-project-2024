TBND is composed of images of the right index finger. During acquisition the subject was instructed to lay her finger over a flat white surface and a simple point-and-shoot camera was used to acquire an image without the the use of a flash. No explicit instructions with respect to force applied were given and thus our results incorporate arbitrary force differences between users and capture sessions.

The first subset D01 consists of images acquired on the first acquisition day. The second subset D02 is composed of images acquired one day later. The third subset D30 was acquired 1 month after the first acquisition date. Given acquisition restrictions, the acquisitions of D30 have up to two days\u2019 tolerance.
