Have a look at the website.\n\nThis dataset contains 9 files in .csv format. You can find a description for each column. Let me summarize it here as well.\n\n1. Cause-wise distribution of suicides in Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) during 2015.\n2. Economic Status-wise distribution of suicides during 2015.\n3. Educational Status-wise distribution of suicides during 2015.\n4. Farmer or Cultivators distribution of suicides during 2015.\n5. Profession-wise distribution of suicides during 2015.\n6. Social status-wise distribution of suicides during 2015.\n7. Cause-wise distribution of suicides during 2015.\n8. Suicides by Agricultural labourers during 2015.\n9. Suicides by means adopted during 2015.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nWe now have plenty of data to explore to draw some conclusions about suicides which happened in India during 2015. Let's start by answering these questions:\n- What are the top 5 states where Farmers' suicides occurred the most?\n- What's the top reason that agricultural labourers committed suicide?\n- Which Profession has the most suicides? What could be the reason?\n- How many Transgender suicides have occurred in different categories?\n\nI hope these questions interest you in starting to explore this dataset.\n\n#### Acknowledgements\n\nI thank the Indian Government for making it public under their Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India.
