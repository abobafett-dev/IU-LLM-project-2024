So to improve this dataset, images had to be augmented in such a way that each class has an equal distribution of images and removing noisy images which could be considered as outliers. Thus this dataset that I've created is a combination of an existing dataset that has been cleaned and equally distributed across each class.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset contains 3 folders labeled as to which class they belong to. the 3 classes are \"with_mask\", \"withou_mask\", and \"mask_weared_incorrect\".
