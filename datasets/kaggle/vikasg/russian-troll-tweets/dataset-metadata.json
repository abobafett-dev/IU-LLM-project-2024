Twitter immediately suspended these accounts, deleting their data from Twitter.com and the Twitter API. A team at NBC News including Ben Popken and EJ Fox was able to reconstruct a dataset consisting of a subset of the deleted data for their investigation and were able to show how these troll accounts went on attack during key election moments. This dataset is the body of this open-sourced reconstruction.\n\nFor more background, read the NBC news article publicizing the release: [\"Twitter deleted 200,000 Russian troll tweets.
