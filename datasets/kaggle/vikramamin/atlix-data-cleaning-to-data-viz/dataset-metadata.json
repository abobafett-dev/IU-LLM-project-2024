  "descriptionNullable": "The reference for the dataset and the dashboard was Youtube Channel codebasics. \nI have used a fictitious company called Atlix where the Sales Director want the sales data to be in a proper format which can help in decision making.\n\nWe have a total of 5 tables namely customers, products, markets, date & transactions.\nThe data is exported from Mysql to Tableau. \n\nIn tableau , inner joins were used. \n\nIn the transactions table, we notice that sum sales amount figures are either negative or zero while the sales qty is either 1 or more. This cannot be right. Therefore, we filter the sales amount table in Tableau by having the least sales amount as minimum 1.\n\nWhen currency column from transactions table was grouped in MySql, we could see \u2018USD\u2019 and \u2018INR\u2019 showing up. We cannot have a sales data showing two currencies. This was rectified by converting the USD sales amount into INR by taking the latest exchange rate at Rs.81.\n\nWe make the above change in tableau by creating a new calculated field called \u2018Normalised Sales Amount\u2019. If [Sales Amount] == \u2018USD\u2019 then [Sales Amount] * 81 else [Sales Amount] End.\n\nConclusion:\nThe dashboard prepared is an interactive dashboard with filters.\nFor eg. By Clicking on Mumbai under \u201cSales by Markets\u201d we will see the results change in the other charts as well as they\nWill now show the results pertaining only to Mumbai. This can be done by year , month, customers , products etc.\nParameter with filter has also been created for top customers and top products. This produces a slider which can be used to view the top 10 customers and products and slide it accordingly. \n\nFollowing information can be passed on to the sales team or director.\n\n Total Sales: from Jun\u201917 to Feb\u201920 has been INR 12.83 million. There is a drop of 57% in the sales revenue from 2018 to 2019. The year 2020 has not been considered as it only account for 2 months data.\n Markets: Mumbai which is the top most performing market and accounts for 51% of the total sales market has seen a drop in sales of almost 64% from 2018 to 2019.\n Top Customers: Path was on 2nd position in terms of sales in the year 2018. It accounted for 19% of the total sales after Electricalslytical which accounted for 21% of the total sales. But in year 2019, both Electricalslytical and Path were the 2nd and 4th highest customers by sales. \nBy targeting the specific markets and customers through new ideas such as promotions, discounts etc we can look to reverse the trend of decreasing sales.\n\n",
