  "descriptionNullable": "The dataset for news recommendation was collected from anonymized behavior logs of News website. The data randomly sampled 1 million users who had at least 5 news clicks during 6 weeks from October 12 to November 22, 2019. To protect user privacy, each user is de-linked from the production system when securely hashed into an anonymized ID. Also collected were the news click behaviors of these users in this period, which are formatted into impression logs. The impression logs have been used in the last week for test, and the logs in the fifth week for training. For samples in the training set, the click behaviors in the first four weeks to construct the news click history for user modeling. Among the training data, the samples on the last day of the fifth week were used as a validation set. \n\n**behaviors.tsv**\nThe behaviors.tsv file contains the impression logs and users' news click histories. It has 5 columns divided by the tab symbol:\n\n* Impression ID. The ID of an impression.\n* User ID. The anonymous ID of a user.\n* Time. The impression time with format \"MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM/PM\".\n* History. The news click history (ID list of clicked news) of this user before this impression.
