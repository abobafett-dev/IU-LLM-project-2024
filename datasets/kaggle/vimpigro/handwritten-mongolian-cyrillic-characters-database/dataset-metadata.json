It is a new database in case of Cyrillic alphabet with sufficient amount of samples.\n\nMongolian Cyrillic is an alphabet set of 35 characters and an official writing system that used in Mongolia. It is identical to Russian alphabet except for two additional characters \u04e8\u04e9 \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9 and \u04ae\u04af \u27e8\u00fc\u27e9. The HMCC database contains both uppercase and lowercase character images for 62 classes and only lowercase character images for letters \u0419, \u042a, \u042b, and \u042c, these 4 letters never come as first letter of a word. Thus the database have maximum 66 classes.\n\nHMCC database consists of 4 datasets with different classes and samples.\nHMCC all: It contains 367116 samples of all 66 classes.\nHMCC balanced: It contains 345500 samples of all 66 classes. Each class equally balanced to 5250 samples.\nHMCC similar: It contains 257250 samples of 49 classes. Merged similar uppercase and lowercase characters (\u0416-\u0436, \u0418-\u0438, \u041a-\u043a, \u041b-\u043b , \u041c-\u043c , \u041e-\u043e , \u0421-\u0441 , \u04ae-\u04af , \u0424-\u0444 , \u0425-\u0445 , \u0426-\u0446, \u0428-\u0448 , \u0429-\u0449 , \u042d-\u044d , \u042e-\u044e , \u042f-\u044f) with equal number of both uppercase and lowercase samples.\nHMCC letters: It contains 183750 samples of 35 classes. Merged all uppercase and lowercase characters with equal number of both uppercase and lowercase samples.\nThere are no test sets created.\nFor detailed information check below HMCC database structure table.\n\n![HMCC structure table][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://i.imgur.com/fYUZNdz.png",
