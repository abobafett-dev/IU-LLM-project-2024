We challenge all the hackers to participate in this computer vision challenge that aims to test skills in deep learning and object detection.\n\n# Problem Statment\n\nPeople detection and head counting is one of the classical albeit challenging computer vision application. For this problem, given a group selfie/photo, you are required to count the number of heads present in the picture. You are provided with a training set of images with coordinates of the bounding box and head coun for each image and need to predict the headcount for each image in the test set.\n\n__Evaluation Metric__\nThe evaluation metric for this competition is RMSE (root mean squared error) over the headcounts predicted for test images.\n\n__Public and Private Split__\nNote that the test data is further randomly divided into Public (30%) and Private (70%) data. Your initial responses will be checked and scored on the Public data. The final rankings would be based on your private score which will be published once the competition is over.\n\n# Data\n\n- 1. ```train.zip```: Contains 2 csvs and 1 folder containing image data\n- 2. ```train.csv``` - ['Name', 'HeadCount'] (contains headcount value for each training image)\n- 3. ```bbox_train.csv``` - ['Name', 'width', 'height' , 'xmin', 'ymin', 'xmax', 'ymax', 'class'] (contains co-ordinates of each head in the train image, located by the formation of a bound-box around the head)\n- 4. ```test.csv``` - ['Name'] (contains only name of testing images)\n- 5. ```sample_submission.csv``` - ['Name', 'HeadCount'] (contains format for a valid submission)",
