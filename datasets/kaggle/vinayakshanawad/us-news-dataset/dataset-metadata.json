The goal is to predict the \u2018category\u2019 label using the \u2018title\u2019 and \u2018abstract; columns. Model B, the recommendation system only requires user_news_clicks.csv but you can use the news_text.csv in addition if you\u2019d like though it is not necessary for this exercise. The goal is to be able to recommend users news articles that they\u2019re likely to click.\n\n### Data Description\n\nIn news_text.csv - each record consists of three attributes and a target variable:\n- Category - There are lots of news categories available in this dataset, as requested we need to only 3 categories - news, sports and finance\n- news_id - Identification number of the news\n- title - Title of the news\n- abstract - Abstract of the news\n\nIn user_news_clicks.csv - each record consists of two attributes and a target variable:\n- click - User has clicked the articles or not\n- user_id - Identification number of the user\n- item - Identification number of an item\n\n### Goals\n\n- Design the deep learning classifier and the recommendation system models\n- Build and train the models using a Python deep learning library such as Tensorflow or PyTorch\n- Test the model\u2019s performance using a set of metrics\n- Report on the performance of the model\n\n### Instructions\n\n- Read about the dataset at\nhttps://github.com/msnews/msnews.github.io/blob/master/assets/doc/introduction.md\n\n**NOTE**: We do not need to use the entire dataset, if resources are limited. Feel free to sample.\n- For Model A, use only the top 3 categories -- namely news, sports, and finance for model training and validation.\n- Code and build the models A and B using a Python library such as Pytorch or Tensorflow",
