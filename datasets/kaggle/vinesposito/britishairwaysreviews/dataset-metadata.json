Should BA focus catering their future marketing toward business travelers? Leisure travelers? Families? Solo travelers?  Let\u2019s see what the data tells us\u2026\n\nQuestions\n\n1.\tWhat areas received the strongest reviews from BA customers?\n2.\tWhat areas received the weakest reviews from BA customers?\n3.\tWhat traveler types leave the most positive reviews?\n4.\tWhat do travelers need the most support with?\n5.\tShould we cater more towards larger families or solo travelers?\n6.\tAre leisure travelers or business travelers more satisfied with BA\u2019s service?\n7.\tAre review scores trending up or down?\n\nData Approach\n\n1.\tDataset uploaded to Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinesposito/britishairwaysreviews \n2.\tWe will be using graphic visualizations to answer the questions above.\n3.\tA total of four visualizations were used to build out this dashboard.  \nData Analysis\n\nI made a dashboard displaying all of them (will be linked to this document).\nI decided to go with four different visualizations to answer the questions above.\nFirst, we have an interactive map that you can sort by review criteria:\n \nSecondly, we can see trends over time given a certain criteria in a line graph:\n \nThird, we have metrics measured by the types of aircrafts:\n \n\nAnd finally, all metrics will updated in real time, depending on the filters the user prefers:\n\n \n \nWith all these tools in place, we can get to answering the relevant questions.\n1.\tWhat areas received the strongest reviews from BA customers?\n \nWhen accounting for all reviews between March 2016 and October 2023, the strongest areas are the cabin staff service and the ground service.  \n\n2.\tWhat areas received the weakest reviews from BA customers?\n\nOn the other hand, clearly the weakest area according to BA customer reviews is the in-flight entertainment.  While we don\u2019t have access to any qualitative data explaining why, it may be useful to reach out to customers who left these reviews and figure out why.  Perhaps it was a poor selection of movies and shows (haven\u2019t we all been there on flights?).  This would be important to address considering BA is the largest international carrier in the UK.  Chances are their flights will be longer given the distance needed to travel. \n\n3.\tWhat traveler types leave the most positive reviews?\n\nBoth solo and couple leisure travelers tend to leave the most positive reviews (average rating of 4.29 and 4.25, respectively).\n \n \n \n \nIn  both groups,  the strongest areas of the reviews are still cabin staff service and ground service, while the weakest area is still entertainment.  \n4.\tWhat do travelers need the most support with?\nIn virtually all subgroups, entertainment is the weakest area of the reviews.  \n5.\tShould we cater more towards larger families or solo travelers?\n \n \nOf the leisure travelers, families left the lowest average review scores in general.  Solo leisure travelers and couple leisure travelers left similar review scores across the board.   Leveraging this is useful considering business travelers tend to travel alone as well.\n6.\tAre leisure travelers or business travelers more satisfied with BA\u2019s service?\nHere are the statistics for business travelers\u2026\n \n \nAnd here is the information for leisure travelers (solo, couple, and family combined)\u2026\n\n \n \nWhile the average ratings appear to be similar, the leisure travelers were more positive in each individual category.  It is also important to note that if we filter our families, then the leisure travelers tend to leave more positive ratings.\n\n \n \n7.\tAre review scores trending up or down?\nFrom March 2016 towards October 2023, they appear to be trending down.\n \nThe trends appear to be sloping negatively, and this can be for a few reasons.  First off, there were clearly going to be less reviews when many flights were canceled due to COVID during 2020, which explains the first major valley on the graph above.   Digging deeper, it turns out BA cut flights again in early 2022 due to the omicron variant.   There also appears be a class action lawsuit against BA for customers not receiving refunds from flights canceled due to COVID-19.\n\nWhile some of this may be hypothetical, it is possible the treatment of customers during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic could have negatively impacted the customer outlook on BA, which is why review scores have been trending down since 2022.\n\nConclusion\nAnd that\u2019s what we have from this dashboard.  There\u2019s plenty of other insights you can take from it.  We could dive down deeper and see if there are correlations between each of the aircraft types.  The goal in this writeup was to give a general overview of reviews, which areas may need to be improved, and what the outlook is going forward.\nThanks for reading!\n\n\n\n",
