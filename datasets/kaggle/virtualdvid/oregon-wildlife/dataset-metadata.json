I didn't want to use the well known data sets such as digits-mnist, fashion-mnist, iris flowers, etc. I decided to just create my own data set about something that I love to do. Summer 2019 is coming and Oregon is beautiful to explore and while I'm driving I'm always looking for a deer on the side of the route, or eagles on top of the trees, and go to the local safaris to see bears (don't want to find them in a hike lol) and take some pictures. So well there is when the idea came out. \"Let's download a data set of Oregon wildlife and get some fun training a model to classify them\".  For this I use a google scraper I found on GitHub. Forked the [repository](https://github.com/virtualdvid/image_search), started a new [branch](https://github.com/virtualdvid/image_search/tree/Create-loop-for-google-search), did some adaptations of that code and downloaded the data set. After the presentation I didn't know what to do with the database. It was just resting on my laptop. I decided to load it here on Kaggle and share some notebooks and hoping this data set can be fun to explore for the community!\n\n\n### Content\n\nHere we find a small data set of 14013 images in the folder `oregon_wildlife.zip` distributed in 20 classes as follows:\n\nfolder: bald_eagle images: 748  \nfolder: black_bear images: 718  \nfolder: cougar images: 680  \nfolder: elk images: 660  \nfolder: gray_wolf images: 730  \nfolder: mountain_beaver images: 577  \nfolder: bobcat images: 696  \nfolder: nutria images: 701  \nfolder: coyote images: 736  \nfolder: columbian_black-tailed_deer images: 735  \nfolder: seals images: 698  \nfolder: canada_lynx images: 717  \nfolder: ringtail images: 588  \nfolder:  red_fox images: 759  \nfolder: gray_fox images: 668  \nfolder: virginia_opossum images: 728  \nfolder: sea_lions images: 726  \nfolder: raccoon images: 728  \nfolder: raven images: 656  \nfolder: deer images: 764\n\nThe second file is a sample of the data with just 5 classes already prepossessed with `GapCV` library in a `h5` file with 3531 images distributed as follows:\n\nkey: bald_eagle images: 748  \nkey: black_bear images: 718  \nkey: cougar images: 680  \nkey: elk images: 660  \nkey: gray_wolf images: 730  ",
