This will be used by data scientists, researchers, the wider machine learning community, and experts from other domains to conduct research into automating the identification and modeling of cassava crop disease in Uganda and potentially in other regions too. Previously published datasets have had issues with **class mislabeling** and real-world application for infield usage of Cassava Images for disease identification, due to the limitation with laboratory settings where the images were captured. There was a need to come up with a high-quality and well-labeled real-world dataset that clearly showcases images with these 3 classes: \n1. Cassava Mosaic Disease\n2. Cassava Brown Streak \n3.
