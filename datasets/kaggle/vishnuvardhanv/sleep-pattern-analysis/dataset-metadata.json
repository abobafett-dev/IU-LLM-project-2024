Download and access more than 50 days of sleep pattern data through which you can answer questions & perform analysis like:\n1. What is the average sleep time?\n2. How many days have I slept for less than 7-8 hours?\n3. How long was my day from the time of wake till the time of sleep?\n4. Also, calculate the optimal value for errors induced in between as I forgot to record the data.\n5. And many more..... \n\nPlease note; this is all **primary & original data** I've been collecting using a self-built app.\n\n****Recommended to view/ download data from the remote source given below.****\n\n## Suggestions on how to improve this dataset are welcome!! \ud83d\ude04 ",
