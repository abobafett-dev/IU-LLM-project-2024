Out of curosity, I just cleaned the .csv files to perform a sentiment analysis. So both the .csv files in this dataset are created by me. \n\nAnything you read in the description is written by David Wallach and using all this information, I happen to perform my first ever sentiment analysis.\n\n\"I have been interested in using public sentiment and journalism to gather sentiment profiles on publicly traded companies. I first developed a Python package (https://github.com/dwallach1/Stocker) that scrapes the web for articles written about companies, and then noticed the abundance of overlap with Twitter. I then developed a NodeJS project that I have been running on my RaspberryPi to monitor Twitter for all tweets coming from those mentioned in the content section. If one of them tweeted about a company in the stocks_cleaned.csv file, then it would write the tweet to the database. Currently, the file is only from earlier today, but after about a month or two, I plan to update the tweets.csv file (hopefully closer to 50,000 entries.\n\nI am not quite sure how this dataset will be relevant, but I hope to use these tweets and try to generate some sense of public sentiment score.\"\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset has all the publicly traded companies (tickers and company names) that were used as input to fill the tweets.csv. The influencers whose tweets were monitored were: ['MarketWatch', 'business', 'YahooFinance', 'TechCrunch', 'WSJ', 'Forbes', 'FT', 'TheEconomist', 'nytimes', 'Reuters', 'GerberKawasaki', 'jimcramer', 'TheStreet', 'TheStalwart', 'TruthGundlach', 'Carl_C_Icahn', 'ReformedBroker', 'benbernanke', 'bespokeinvest', 'BespokeCrypto', 'stlouisfed', 'federalreserve', 'GoldmanSachs', 'ianbremmer', 'MorganStanley', 'AswathDamodaran', 'mcuban', 'muddywatersre', 'StockTwits', 'SeanaNSmith'\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe data used here is gathered from a project I developed : https://github.com/dwallach1/StockerBot\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI hope to develop a financial sentiment text classifier that would be able to track Twitter's (and the entire public's) feelings about any publicly traded company (and cryptocurrency)",
