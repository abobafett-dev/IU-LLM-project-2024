This dataset has **31432 topics** with **200785 messages**.\n\n`golang-nuts.tar.xz` is the fetched emails as of 2018/12/09 and `golang-nuts.json.gz` is the metadata of each discussion topic. There is also `threads.csv.gz` with plain text messages per topic, in logical order and with some filtering performed. E.g. citations were removed.
