The images are labeled with one of seven emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, or neutral.\nClasses: The seven classes in the FER2013 dataset are:\nAngry (label 1)\nDisgust (label 2)\nFear (label 3)\nHappy (label 4)\nNeutral (label 5)\nSad (label 6)\nSurprise (label 7)\n\nThe FER2013 dataset is a challenging dataset for facial expression recognition, as the images are of low resolution and the emotions are often subtle. However, the dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and developers who are working on facial expression recognition algorithms.",
