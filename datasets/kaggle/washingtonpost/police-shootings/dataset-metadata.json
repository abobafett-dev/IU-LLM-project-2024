The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths.\n\nThe FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. In 2015, The Post documented more than two times more fatal shootings by police than had been recorded by the FBI.\n\nThe Post\u2019s database is updated regularly as fatal shootings are reported and as facts emerge about individual cases. The Post is seeking assistance in making the database as comprehensive as possible.
