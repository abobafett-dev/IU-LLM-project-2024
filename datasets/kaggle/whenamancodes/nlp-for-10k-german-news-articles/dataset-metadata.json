  "descriptionNullable": "# :::: Ten Thousand German News Articles Dataset ::::\nA dataset for topic extraction from 10k German News Articles and NLP for German language.\nEnglish text classification datasets are common. Examples are the big AG News, the class-rich 20 Newsgroups and the large-scale DBpedia ontology datasets for topic classification and for example the commonly used IMDb and Yelp datasets for sentiment analysis. Non-english datasets, especially German datasets, are less common. There is a collection of sentiment analysis datasets assembled by the Interest Group on German Sentiment Analysis. To my knowledge the MLDoc contains German documents for classification.\nDue to grammatical differences between the English and the German language, a classifier might be effective on a English dataset, but not as effective on a German dataset. The German language has a higher inflection and long compound words are quite common compared to the English language. One would need to evaluate a classifier on multiple German datasets to get a sense of it\u2019s effectiveness.\n\n# :::: What It Cointains ::::\nThe 10kGNAD dataset is intended to solve part of this problem as the first german topic classification dataset. It consists of 10273 german language news articles from an austrian online newspaper categorized into nine topics. These articles are a till now unused part of the One Million Posts Corpus.\nIn the One Million Posts Corpus each article has a topic path. For example Newsroom/Wirtschaft/Wirtschaftpolitik/Finanzmaerkte/Griechenlandkrise. The 10kGNAD uses the second part of the topic path, here Wirtschaft, as class label. The article titles and texts are concatenated into one text and the authors are removed to avoid a keyword like classification on autors frequent in a class.\nI created and used this dataset in my thesis to train and evaluate four text classifiers on the German language. By publishing the dataset I hope to support the advancement of tools and models for the German language. Additionally this dataset can be used as a benchmark dataset for german topic classification.\n\n## Citations:\n@InProceedings{Schabus2017,\n  Author    = {Dietmar Schabus and Marcin Skowron and Martin Trapp},\n  Title     = {One Million Posts: A Data Set of German Online Discussions},\n  Booktitle = {Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR)},\n  Pages     = {1241--1244},\n  Year      = {2017},\n  Address   = {Tokyo, Japan},\n  Doi       = {10.1145/3077136.3080711},\n  Month     = aug\n}\n@InProceedings{Schabus2018,\n  author    = {Dietmar Schabus and Marcin Skowron},\n  title     = {Academic-Industrial Perspective on the Development and Deployment of a Moderation System for a Newspaper Website},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC)},\n  year      = {2018},\n  address   = {Miyazaki, Japan},\n  month     = may,\n  pages     = {1602-1605},\n  abstract  = {This paper describes an approach and our experiences from the development, deployment and usability testing of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval system that supports the moderation of user comments on a large newspaper website.
