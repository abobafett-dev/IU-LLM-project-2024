This dataset is recommended for tasks related to segmentation masks.\n- SeaTurtleIDHeads (this dataset): Public datasets of images of cropped heads. This dataset is recommended for tasks related to re-identification and turtle detection. The resolution of the heads are higher than in SeaTurtleID2022.\n\nThese datasets contain 7582 photos of 400 unique individuals collected within 12 years in 1081 encounters.

The Owner retains the full copyright of the photographs of the Dataset.\n- The Dataset can be used to develop, test, analyse existing and future algorithms in machine learning, imaging science and computer vision. Reproduction of reasonable number of photographs of the Dataset in relevant scientific publications, preprints, posters, presentations from these disciplines is allowed, provided that the present paper is properly cited. No other reproduction of the photographs of the Dataset (printed or digital, including for personal use) is allowed.\n- No commercial use of the photographs of the Dataset is allowed whatsoever. This includes commercial use of algorithms that were \"trained'' using the dataset.\n- The Dataset cannot be used in studies that focus on biological, ecological, and/or conservation aspects of marine turtles. For such use, the Owner must be contacted in advance and must give his explicit permission.",
