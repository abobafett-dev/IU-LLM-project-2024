The bin images in this dataset are captured as robot units carry pods as part of normal Amazon Fulfillment Center operations. This dataset has many images and the corresponding medadata.\n\nThe image files have three groups according to its naming scheme.\n\n- A file name with 1~4 digits (1,200): 1.jpg ~ 1200.jpg\n- A file name with 5 digits (99,999): 00001.jpg ~ 99999.jpg\n- A file name with 6 digits (435,235): 100000.jpg ~ 535234.jpg\n\n**Amazon Bin Image Dataset (536,434 images, 224x224)** dataset aims to provide a **resized** image files and a full metadata SQLite file for Kaggle Kernel environments.
