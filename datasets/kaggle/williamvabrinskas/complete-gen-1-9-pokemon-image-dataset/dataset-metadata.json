After about 1024 the numbers are not accurate to the Pokedex as those are variations on existing Pokemon but they are labeled in order to make label generation easier. \n\nThe accompanied `pokemon_labels.csv` is exactly that; it's a one line `csv` file where the number corresponds directly to the image in the directory. \n\n`pokemon_label_with_titles.csv` is a CSV formatted with the columns `image` and `label` where image corresponds to  the image name in the images directory. \n\nThis was mainly tested with my custom machine learning framework in swift:  https://github.com/wvabrinskas/Neuron \nbut it should work with really any machine learning framework",
