Memetracker tracks the quotes and phrases that appear most frequently over time across this entire online news spectrum. This makes it possible to see how different stories compete for news and blog coverage each day, and how certain stories persist while others fade quickly.\n\nOverall Memetracker tracks more than 17 million different phrases and about 54% of the total phrase/quote mentions appear on blos and 46% in news media.\n\nFor each document (blog post or news media article):\n- URL (author)\n- Time\n- Memes\n- Links\n\n----\n\n### Volume Time Series of Memetracker Phrases and Twitter Hashtags\n\nData contains the time series of the volume (the number of mention per hour) of 1,000 Memetracker phrases and 1,000 Twitter hashtags. Memetracker phrases are the 1,000 highest total volume phrases among 343 million phrases collected from Sep 2008 to Aug 2009. Twitter hashtags are the 1,000 highest total volume hashtags among 6 million hashtags from Jun to Dec 2009.\n\n----\n\n### Higgs Twitter Dataset\n\nThe Higgs dataset has been built after monitoring the spreading processes on Twitter before, during and after the announcement of the discovery of a new particle with the features of the elusive Higgs boson on 4th July 2012. The messages posted in Twitter about this discovery between 1st and 7th July 2012 are considered.\n\nThe four directional networks made available here have been extracted from user activities in Twitter as:\n1. re-tweeting (retweet network)\n2. replying (reply network) to existing tweets\n3. mentioning (mention network) other users\n4. friends/followers social relationships among user involved in the above activities\n5. information about activity on Twitter during the discovery of Higgs boson\n\nIt is worth remarking that the user IDs have been anonimized, and the same user ID is used for all networks. This choice allows to use the Higgs dataset in studies about large-scale interdependent/interconnected multiplex/multilayer networks, where one layer accounts for the social structure and three layers encode different types of user dynamics .\n\nNote that this dataset has been updated on Mar 31 2015. If you downloaded a previous version, please update it, results could differ.\n\nFor more information about data collection, please refer to our paper.\n\n----\n\nStanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP) is a general purpose, high performance system for analysis and manipulation of large networks. Graphs consists of nodes and directed/undirected/multiple edges between the graph nodes. Networks are graphs with data on nodes and/or edges of the network.\n\nThe core SNAP library is written in C++ and optimized for maximum performance and compact graph representation. It easily scales to massive networks with hundreds of millions of nodes, and billions of edges. It efficiently manipulates large graphs, calculates structural properties, generates regular and random graphs, and supports attributes on nodes and edges. Besides scalability to large graphs, an additional strength of SNAP is that nodes, edges and attributes in a graph or a network can be changed dynamically during the computation.\n\nSNAP was originally developed by Jure Leskovec in the course of his PhD studies. The first release was made available in Nov, 2009. SNAP uses a general purpose STL (Standard Template Library)-like library GLib developed at Jozef Stefan Institute. SNAP and GLib are being actively developed and used in numerous academic and industrial projects.\nhttp://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html#onlinecoms",
