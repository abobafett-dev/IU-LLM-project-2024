Twitter users   \ntweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to  \nreceive their tweets. The goal of this paper is to study the topological   \ncharacteristics of Twitter and its power as a new medium of information    \nsharing.                                                                   \n                                                                           \nWe have crawled the entire Twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user     \nprofiles, 1.47 billion social relations, 4,262 trending topics, and 106    \nmillion tweets. In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a\nnon-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter, and low   \nreciprocity, which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human\nsocial networks~\\cite{Newman03}. In order to identify influentials on      \nTwitter, we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank   \nand found two rankings to be similar. Ranking by retweets differs from the \nprevious two rankings, indicating a gap in influence inferred from the     \nnumber of followers and that from the popularity of one's tweets. We have  \nanalyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal  \nbehavior and user participation. We have classified the trending topics    \nbased on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority (over \n85%) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature. A closer    \nlook at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of\n1,000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original      \ntweet. Once retweeted, a tweet gets retweeted almost instantly on next     \nhops, signifying fast diffusion of information after the 1st retweet.      \n                                                                           \nTo the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study on  \nthe entire Twittersphere and information diffusion on it.                  \n                                                                           \nhttp://an.kaist.ac.kr/~haewoon/papers/2010-www-twitter.pdf                 \n                                                                           \n@inproceedings{Kwak10www,                                                  \nauthor = {Kwak, Haewoon and Lee, Changhyun and Park, Hosung and            \n    Moon, Sue},                                                            \ntitle = \"{W}hat is {T}witter, a social network or a news media?\",          \nbooktitle = {WWW '10: Proc. the 19th Intl.

The graph Problem.A only holds \nthe Twitter follower graph for non-empty nodes.  A(i,j)=1 if user with     \nnodeid(i) is followed by user with nodeid(j).  For example, the first two  \nnon-empty userid's are nodeid(1)=12 and nodeid(2)=13, and the first edge is\n(12,13).  Thus A(1,2)=1 since nodeid(1)=12 is followed by nodeid(2)=13.    \nThe user id's of the nodes in the graph are held in Problem.aux.nodeid.\n",

Twitter users   \ntweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to  \nreceive their tweets. The goal of this paper is to study the topological   \ncharacteristics of Twitter and its power as a new medium of information    \nsharing.                                                                   \n                                                                           \nWe have crawled the entire Twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user     \nprofiles, 1.47 billion social relations, 4,262 trending topics, and 106    \nmillion tweets. In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a\nnon-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter, and low   \nreciprocity, which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human\nsocial networks~\\cite{Newman03}. In order to identify influentials on      \nTwitter, we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank   \nand found two rankings to be similar. Ranking by retweets differs from the \nprevious two rankings, indicating a gap in influence inferred from the     \nnumber of followers and that from the popularity of one's tweets. We have  \nanalyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal  \nbehavior and user participation. We have classified the trending topics    \nbased on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority (over \n85%) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature. A closer    \nlook at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of\n1,000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original      \ntweet. Once retweeted, a tweet gets retweeted almost instantly on next     \nhops, signifying fast diffusion of information after the 1st retweet.      \n                                                                           \nTo the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study on  \nthe entire Twittersphere and information diffusion on it.                  \n                                                                           \nhttp://an.kaist.ac.kr/~haewoon/papers/2010-www-twitter.pdf                 \n                                                                           \n@inproceedings{Kwak10www,                                                  \nauthor = {Kwak, Haewoon and Lee, Changhyun and Park, Hosung and            \n    Moon, Sue},                                                            \ntitle = \"{W}hat is {T}witter, a social network or a news media?\",          \nbooktitle = {WWW '10: Proc. the 19th Intl.

The graph Problem.A only holds \nthe Twitter follower graph for non-empty nodes.  A(i,j)=1 if user with     \nnodeid(i) is followed by user with nodeid(j).  For example, the first two  \nnon-empty userid's are nodeid(1)=12 and nodeid(2)=13, and the first edge is\n(12,13).  Thus A(1,2)=1 since nodeid(1)=12 is followed by nodeid(2)=13.    \nThe user id's of the nodes in the graph are held in Problem.aux.nodeid.\n",
