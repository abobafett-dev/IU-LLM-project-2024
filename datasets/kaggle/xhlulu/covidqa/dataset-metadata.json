The selection process varies depending on the dataset, and is optional.\n\nIn addition, we included a clean, tabular version of **290k non-COVID Q&A pairs**, queried from the same Stackexchange communities. You can [download it here](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/stackexchange-qa-pairs).\n\n### Model summary\n\n* Electra-small and Electra-base, both trained on 500k subsample of [Healthtap Q&A pairs](https://github.com/durakkerem/Medical-Question-Answer-Datasets).\n* Electra-small and Electra-base, both trained on 290k question and answer pairs from Stackexchange.\n* 2 versions of Multilingual DistilBERT, trained on Healthtap and on Stackexchange, respectively.\n* All the models were finetuned in `tf.keras` on Kaggle's TPUs. \n* All the training scripts are available on Kaggle, and can be easily rerun. Check out the \"Source Code\" section for more information.\n\n### Are you releasing a new model for diagnosing COVID-19? Can we start using it for our projects?\n\nThe goal of COVID-QA is not to release novel models, but to **provide a dataset for evaluating your own Q&A models**, along with strong **baselines that you can easily reproduce and improve**. In fact, the datasets relate more closely to news, public health, and community discussions; it is **not intended to be used in a clinical setting, and should not be used to influence clinical outcomes**. Both the data and models are there to help you for your research projects or R&D prototypes. **If you are planning to build and deploy any model or system that uses COVID-QA in some way, please ensure that it is sufficiently tested and validated by medical and public health experts. The content of this collection has not been medically validated.**\n\n### For more information\n\nAll the instructions are on our repository.
