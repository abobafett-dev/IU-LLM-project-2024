  "descriptionNullable": "Feature introduction:\n\nFixed acidity: acids are major wine properties and contribute greatly to the wine\u2019s taste. Usually, the total acidity is divided into two groups: the volatile acids and the nonvolatile or fixed acids. Among the fixed acids that you can find in wines are the following: tartaric, malic, citric, and succinic. This variable is expressed in g(tartaricacidtartaricacid)/dm3dm3 in the data sets.\n\nVolatile acidity: the volatile acidity is basically the process of wine turning into vinegar. In the U.S, the legal limits of Volatile Acidity are 1.2 g/L for red table wine and 1.1 g/L for white table wine. In these data sets, the volatile acidity is expressed in g(aceticacidaceticacid)/dm3dm3.\n\nCitric acid is one of the fixed acids that you\u2019ll find in wines. It\u2019s expressed in g/dm3dm3 in the two data sets.\nResidual sugar typically refers to the sugar remaining after fermentation stops, or is stopped. It\u2019s expressed in g/dm3dm3 in the red and white data.\n\nChlorides can be a major contributor to saltiness in wine. Here, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s expressed in g(sodiumchloridesodiumchloride)/dm3dm3.\n\nFree sulfur dioxide: the part of the sulphur dioxide that is added to a wine and that is lost into it is said to be bound, while the active part is said to be free. Winemaker will always try to get the highest proportion of free sulphur to bind. This variables is expressed in mg/dm3dm3 in the data.\n\nTotal sulfur dioxide is the sum of the bound and the free sulfur dioxide (SO2). Here, it\u2019s expressed in mg/dm3dm3. There are legal limits for sulfur levels in wines: in the EU, red wines can only have 160mg/L, while white and rose wines can have about 210mg/L. Sweet wines are allowed to have 400mg/L. For the US, the legal limits are set at 350mg/L and for Australia, this is 250mg/L.\n\nDensity is generally used as a measure of the conversion of sugar to alcohol. Here, it\u2019s expressed in g/cm3cm3.\npH or the potential of hydrogen is a numeric scale to specify the acidity or basicity the wine. As you might know, solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic, while solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. With a pH of 7, pure water is neutral. Most wines have a pH between 2.9 and 3.9 and are therefore acidic.\n\nSulphates are to wine as gluten is to food. You might already know sulphites from the headaches that they can cause. They are a regular part of the winemaking around the world and are considered necessary. In this case, they are expressed in g(potassiumsulphatepotassiumsulphate)/dm3dm3.\n\nAlcohol: wine is an alcoholic beverage and as you know, the percentage of alcohol can vary from wine to wine. It shouldn\u2019t surprised that this variable is inclued in the data sets, where it\u2019s expressed in % vol.\n\nQuality: wine experts graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). The eventual number is the median of at least three evaluations made by those same wine experts.",
