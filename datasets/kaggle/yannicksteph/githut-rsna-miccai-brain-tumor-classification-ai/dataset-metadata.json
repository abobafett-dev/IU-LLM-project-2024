The images are provided in DICOM format and are accompanied by a CSV file containing radiomic features extracted from the images.\n\nHere's the competition [RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification/data?select=train_labels.csv)\n\n#### Why\nThe **\"mateuszbuda_brain-segmentation-pytorch_unet\"** library was utilized to obtain data for our brain dataset. This library is based on the Unet neural network architecture and specifically designed for brain segmentation from medical images.\n\nBy leveraging the capabilities of this library, accurate brain segmentation was achieved on the images within our dataset. Segmentation is a critical task in medical imaging as it enables the extraction of precise information about different regions or classes, in this case, brain structures.\n\nThe selection of the **\"mateuszbuda_brain-segmentation-pytorch_unet\"** library was based on its exceptional performance and user-friendly nature. It provides an efficient implementation of the Unet architecture, renowned for its success in biomedical image segmentation. Consequently, our project was able to deliver reliable and accurate results for brain segmentation.\n\nIn conclusion, the utilization of the **\"mateuszbuda_brain-segmentation-pytorch_unet\"** library played a pivotal role in acquiring accurate brain segmentation data for our dataset. By leveraging this library, we efficiently segmented medical images and extracted valuable information to further our project's objectives.\n\nSource: [mateuszbuda_brain-segmentation-pytorch_unet on PyTorch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/mateuszbuda_brain-segmentation-pytorch_unet/)\n\n#### Library\n\nTo achieve tumor segmentation, the U-Net for Brain MRI model will be employed.\n\nU-Net for Brain MRI is a convolutional neural network model specifically designed for segmenting brain MRI images. It features a U-shaped architecture with branch connections, comprising four levels of blocks. Each block consists of two convolution layers with batch normalization, ReLU activation function, and an encoding part with a max pooling layer, while the decoding part utilizes up-convolution. The number of convolution filters varies across the model's levels, ranging from 32 to 256.\n\nTo utilize the model, an input brain MRI image with three channels corresponding to pre-contrast, FLAIR, and post-contrast sequences should be provided. The image should be scaled to a size of 256x256 pixels and normalized using the z-score method per volume.\n\nThe pre-trained U-Net model produces a single-channel probability map indicating anomalous regions in the input image. By applying an appropriate threshold, this probability map can be converted into a binary segmentation mask.\n\nIn summary, U-Net for Brain MRI is a pre-trained model capable of automatically segmenting abnormalities in brain MRI images. Its application extends to various medical imaging tasks, including brain tumor detection and analysis.\n\n\nTo perform shape analysis and extract relevant features, the **2D and 3D** class will be utilized.\n\nData from Source: [rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification)\n",
