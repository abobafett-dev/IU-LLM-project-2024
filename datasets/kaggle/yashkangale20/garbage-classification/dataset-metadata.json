Each category represents a specific type of garbage item commonly found in everyday waste. The purpose of the Garbage Image Dataset is to provide a collection of labelled images of garbage items from different categories. The dataset can be used to train and evaluate deep learning models for garbage classification tasks. By training models on this dataset, they can learn to classify real world images of garbage items into one of the predefined categories.",
