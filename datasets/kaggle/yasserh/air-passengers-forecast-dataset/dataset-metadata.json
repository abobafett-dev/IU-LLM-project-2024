Our collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence the word 'George' and the area code '650' are indicators of non-spam. These are useful when constructing a personalized spam filter. One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general-purpose spam filter.\n\nThe dataset, taken from the UCI ML repository, contains about 4600 emails labelle as **spam** or **ham**. \n\n### Acknowledgements:\nThis dataset has been referred from Kaggle.\n\n### Objective:\n- Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).\n- Build classification models to predict whether or not the email is spam.\n- Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.",
