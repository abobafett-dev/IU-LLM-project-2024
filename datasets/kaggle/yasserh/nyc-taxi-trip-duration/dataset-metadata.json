The data was originally published by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The data was sampled and cleaned for the purposes of this playground competition. Based on individual trip attributes, participants should predict the duration of each trip in the test set.\n\nThe datset contains the following fields:\nid - a unique identifier for each trip\nvendor_id - a code indicating the provider associated with the trip record\npickup_datetime - date and time when the meter was engaged\ndropoff_datetime - date and time when the meter was disengaged\npassenger_count - the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value)\npickup_longitude - the longitude where the meter was engaged\npickup_latitude - the latitude where the meter was engaged\ndropoff_longitude - the longitude where the meter was disengaged\ndropoff_latitude - the latitude where the meter was disengaged\nstore_and_fwd_flag - This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server - Y=store and forward; N=not a store and forward trip\ntrip_duration - duration of the trip in seconds\n\n### Acknowledgement: \nThe dataset is taken from Kaggle:\\\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data\n\n### Objective:\n- Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).\n- Build Regression models to predict the duration of taxi trip.\n- Also evaluate the models & compare thier respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.!",
