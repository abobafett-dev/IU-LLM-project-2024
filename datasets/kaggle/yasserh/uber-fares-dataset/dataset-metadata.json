In this project, we're looking to predict the fare for their future transactional cases. Uber delivers service to lakhs of customers daily. Now it becomes really important to manage their data properly to come up with new business ideas to get best results. Eventually, it becomes really important to estimate the fare prices accurately.\n\n### The datset contains the following fields:\n* key - a unique identifier for each trip\n* fare_amount - the cost of each trip in usd\n* pickup_datetime - date and time when the meter was engaged\n* passenger_count - the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value)\n* pickup_longitude - the longitude where the meter was engaged\n* pickup_latitude - the latitude where the meter was engaged\n* dropoff_longitude - the longitude where the meter was disengaged\n* dropoff_latitude - the latitude where the meter was disengaged\n\n### Acknowledgement: \nThe dataset is referred from Kaggle.\n\n### Objective:\n- Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).\n- Build Regression models to predict the fare price of uber ride.\n- Also evaluate the models & compare thier respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.",
