They are from The UW Shoulder Site ([Web Link]), manufacturer websites, and Feeley Lab at UCSF. The original collection included 605 X-ray images. Eight images that appeared to have been taken from the same patients were removed, resulting in the final 597 images. The final set contains images from the following manufacturers: 83 from Cofield, 294 from Depuy, 71 from Tornier, and 149 from Zimmer, resulting in a 4-class classification problem.
