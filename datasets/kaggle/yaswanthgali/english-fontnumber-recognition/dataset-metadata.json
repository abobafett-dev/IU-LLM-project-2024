With today's omnipresence of cameras, the applications of automatic character recognition are broader than ever. For Latin script, this is largely considered a solved problem in constrained situations, such as images of scanned documents containing common character fonts and uniform background. However, images obtained with popular cameras and hand held devices still pose a formidable challenge for character recognition. The challenging aspects of this problem are evident in this dataset.\n\n### Content\n\nThe data contains 62 directories which include image data of 26 capital alphabets, 26 small alphabets and 10 digits\n\n### Source\n\nhttp://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI like to play with images and that inspires me to build and find awesome  image datasets for using.",
