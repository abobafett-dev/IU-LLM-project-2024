This test is structured so that someone with the baseline skills needed to succeed in the role should be able to complete this in under 4 hours without assistance.\n\nUse the data in the included sheet to address the following scenario...\n\nSince its inception, AgroStar has been leveraging an assisted marketplace model. Given that the market potential is huge and that the target customer appreciates a physical store nearby, we have taken a call to explore the offline retail model to drive growth. The primary objective is to get a larger wallet share for AgroStar among existing customers.\n\n**Assume you are back in time, in August 2018 and you have been asked to determine the location (taluka) of the first AgroStar offline retail store.**\n1. What are the key factors you would use to determine the location? Why?\n2. What taluka (across three states) would you look open in? Why?\n\n### Guidelines:\n-- (1) Please mention any assumptions you have made and the underlying thought process\n-- (2) Please treat the assignment as standalone (it should be self-explanatory to someone who reads it), but we will have a follow-up discussion with you in which we will walk through your approach to this assignment.\n-- (3) Mention any data that may be missing that would make this study more meaningful\n-- (4) `Kindly conduct your analysis within the spreadsheet, we would like to see the working sheet`.
