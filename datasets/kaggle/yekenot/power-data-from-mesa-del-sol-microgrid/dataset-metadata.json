End date : 31st July, 2023.\n\nData resolution: 10 Seconds.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nMicrogrids are small, self-contained power grids that can operate independently of the main grid. They are becoming increasingly popular as a way to improve the reliability and resilience of the power grid. This dataset includes power data collected from Mesa Del Sol microgrid located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It contains measurements of voltage, current, power, and energy for microgrid's components. This dataset consist of 18 features and was collected over the past 15 months.  The dataset is valuable for machine learning applications that can be used to improve the operation and management of microgrids. For example, the data could be used to train machine learning models to predict power outages or to optimise the microgrid's energy consumption.\n\n**Detailed information about each column follows:**\n\n* **Timestamp:** The date and time of the measurement (YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss).\n* **Battery Active Power:** The amount of power being generated by the battery (Kilowatts).\n* **Battery Active Power Set Response:** The response of the battery to a change in the set point (Kilowatts).\n* **PVPCS Active Power:** The amount of power being generated by the photovoltaic solar panels (Kilowatts).\n* **GE Body Active Power:** The amount of power being consumed by the GE body (Kilowatts).\n* **GE Active Power:** The total amount of power being consumed by the microgrid (Kilowatts).\n* **GE Body Active Power Set Response:** The response of the GE body to a change in the set point (Kilowatts).\n* **FC Active Power (FC-end) Set:** The set point for the FC active power (Kilowatts).\n* **FC Active Power:** The amount of power being generated by the fuel cell (Kilowatts).\n* **FC Active Power (FC-end) Set Response:** The response of the FC to a change in the set point (Kilowatts).\n* **Island mode MCCB Active Power:** The amount of power being consumed by the island mode MCCB (Kilowatts).\n* **MG-LV-MSB AC Voltage:** The AC voltage at the MG-LV-MSB bus (Volts).\n* **Receiving Point AC Voltage:** The AC voltage at the receiving point (Volts).\n* **Island mode MCCB AC Voltage:** The AC voltage at the island mode MCCB bus (Volts).\n* **Island mode MCCB Frequency:** The frequency at the island mode MCCB bus (Hertz).\n* **MG-LV-MSB Frequency:** The frequency at the MG-LV-MSB bus (Hertz).\n* **Inlet Temperature of Chilled Water:** The temperature of the chilled water entering the chilled water plant (Degree Celsius).\n* **Outlet Temperature:** The temperature of the chilled water leaving the chilled water plant (Degree Celsius).\n\n**Acknowledgements:**\n\nIf you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\nhttps://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fqz612jzb",
