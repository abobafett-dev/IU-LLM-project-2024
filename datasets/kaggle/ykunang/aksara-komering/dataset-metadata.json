The second dataset is an argumentation dataset, which is a modification of the original dataset which was generated by the augmentation technique.\nThere are two files on this page, namely:\nTrain_asli.zip : training set images without any arguments (405,254,847 bytes)\nTest_asli.zip : training set images without augmentation (xxxxx bytes).\n\nFiles can be downloaded and then uncompressed. Image files use the standard jpg and png formats. To read it can be read with a simple program.\nThe image file is written in black and white (bilevel) Komering script that has not been compressed. The classification technique that has been tried shows that the accuracy value obtained can reach &gt;99% depending on the algorithm and pre-processing method used.\n\nKomering script itself consists of 28 basic characters that have 12 variants of vowels or punctuation marks that change the reading of the characters. With these vowel variants, there are 336 character variants collected. The determination of the variants of characters that were collected and examples of their writing involved sources from the 'Komunitas Pecinta Aksara Ulu', South Sumatra.\nThis data was taken by collecting 100 handwriting patterns from 100 respondents who imitated the script consisting of 336 characters. Respondents themselves were determined by purposive sampling technique with a range of age variants from 9 years to 50 years.\n",
