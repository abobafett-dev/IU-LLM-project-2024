It comprises over 20,000 face images with detailed annotations, including age, gender, and ethnicity. The images exhibit a diverse range of poses, facial expressions, lighting conditions, occlusions, and resolutions. This dataset can be used for a variety of tasks, such as face detection, age estimation, and more. The annotations are from [mivolo ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04616).
