Therefore, we obtained a database of retinal images available at [Retinal OCT Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/kermany2018) in which we took a dataset of only DME subjects. From this dataset, only 1000 images were chosen by the medical experts at Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS) Jamshoro, that are trained to identify Cystoid Macular Edema (CME) and its progression and provide a confirmatory diagnosis of CME. Whereas 200 OCT images are taken with the consent of patients from the Institute of Ophthalmology, Jamshoro for the testing set. These OCT images were explicitly selected to contain several CME regions and a wide variety in their shapes and sizes which is utilized for both training and test sets to get better results.\n\nIn OCT images, the approach of semantic segmentation is that each pixel of an image is labeled with a corresponding clinical class representing a particular disease. The manual binary image masking was performed accordingly using the Image Segmentation application in MATLAB software offers a variety of tools (flood fill/draw freehand) for manually selecting an image region of interest (ROI). This was necessary for the training of our model to identify and isolate the CME and to validate the accuracy of digitally picked ROIs (CME).
