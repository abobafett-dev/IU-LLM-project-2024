Comprising over 14,000 labeled images across six distinct classes, it provides a diverse and extensive collection for training, validation, and testing purposes, specifically tailored for gray-scale image processing.\n\n**The dataset is organized into three main directories:**\n\n**Training Set (train):**This directory contains 11,942 gray-scale images, carefully curated and labeled across the six classes.\n\n**Validation Set (validation):** With 1,922 gray-scale images, this subset provides a means for fine-tuning models and evaluating their performance during development.\n\n**Test Set (test):** Comprising 985 gray-scale images, this directory is reserved for final model evaluation and benchmarking.\n\n**The dataset encompasses six classes of driving behaviors:**\n\n**1- Dangerous Driving:** Gray-scale images capturing instances of reckless or hazardous driving behavior, such as speeding or erratic lane changes.\n**2- Distracted Driving:** Instances where the driver's attention is diverted away from the road, possibly due to smartphone usage, eating, or interacting with passengers.\n**3- Drinking:** Gray-scale images depicting drivers consuming alcoholic beverages while behind the wheel, highlighting the dangers of driving under the influence.\n**4- Safe Driving:** Examples of responsible and cautious driving behavior captured in gray-scale, including obeying traffic laws, maintaining safe distances, and using turn signals.\n**5- Sleepy Driving:** Instances where drivers exhibit signs of drowsiness or fatigue, posing a significant risk of accidents due to reduced alertness, depicted in gray-scale.\n**6- Yawn:** Gray-scale images capturing drivers in the act of yawning, often indicative of fatigue or tiredness, which can impair driving performance.\n",
