The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).The task is to predict the quality of wine using the given data.\n\nA simple yet challenging project, to anticipate the quality of wine.\nThe complexity arises due to the fact that the dataset has fewer samples, & is highly imbalanced.\n\n# Features contained\n\n## Input variables (on the basis of physicochemical tests)\n1 - fixed acidity\n2 - volatile acidity\n3 - citric acid\n4 - residual sugar\n5 - chlorides\n6 - free sulfur dioxide\n7 - total sulfur dioxide\n8 - density\n9 - pH\n10 - sulphates\n11 - alcohol\n\n## Output variable (based on sensory data):\n12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)\n\n# Challenges\n\n1.
