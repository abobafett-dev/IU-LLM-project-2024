  "descriptionNullable": "# Context \n\nPakistan Suicide Bombing Attacks (1995-2016)\n\n\nSuicide bombing is an operational method in which the very act of the attack is dependent upon the death of the perpetrator. Though only 3% of all terrorist attacks around the world can be classified as suicide bombing attacks these account for 48% of the casualties. Explosions and suicide bombings have become the modus operandi of terrorist organizations throughout the world. The world is full of unwanted explosives, brutal bombings, accidents, and violent conflicts, and there is a need to understand the impact of these explosions on one\u2019s surroundings, the environment, and most importantly on human bodies. From 1980 to 2001 (excluding 9/11/01) the average number of deaths per incident for suicide bombing attacks was 13. This number is far above the average of less than one death per incident across all types of terrorist attacks over the same time period. Suicide bombers, unlike any other device or means of destruction, can think and therefore detonate the charge at an optimal location with perfect timing to cause maximum carnage and destruction. Suicide bombers are adaptive and can quickly change targets if forced by security risk or the availability of better targets.  Suicide attacks are relatively inexpensive to fund and technologically primitive, as IEDs can be readily constructed. \n\nWorld has seen more than 3,600 suicide bombing attacks in over 40 countries since 1982. Suicide Bombing has wreaked havoc in Pakistan in the last decade or so. From only a couple of attacks before 2000, it kept escalating after the US Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, promiscuously killing hundreds of people each year, towering as one of the most prominent security threats that every single Pakistani faces today. The conundrum of suicide bombing in Pakistan has obliterated 6,982 clean-handed civilians and injured another 17,624 in a total of 475 attacks since 1995. More than 94% of these attacks have taken place after year 2006. From 2007 to 2013 the country witnessed a suicide bombing attack on every 6th day that increased to every 4th day in 2013. Counting the dead and the injured, each attack victimizes 48 people in Pakistan. \n\nPakistan Body Count (www.PakistanBodyCount.org) is the oldest and most accurate running tally of suicide bombings in Pakistan. The given database (PakistanSuicideAttacks.CSV) has been populated by using majority of the data from Pakistan Body Count, and building up on it by canvassing open source newspapers, media reports, think tank analyses, and personal contacts in media and law enforcement agencies. We provide a count of the people killed and injured in suicide attacks, including the ones who died later in hospitals or homes due to injuries caused or aggravated by these attacks (second and tertiary blast injuries), making it the most authentic source for suicide attacks related data in this region.\n  \nWe will keep releasing the updates every quarter at this page.\n\n\n\n# Content\n\nGeography: Pakistan\n\nTime period: 1995-2016 \n\nUnit of analysis: Attack\n\nDataset: The dataset contains detailed information of 475 suicide bombing attacks in Pakistan that killed an estimated 6,982 and injured 17,624 people. \n\nVariables: The dataset contains Serial No, Incident Date, Islamic Date (based on Islamic lunar calendar), approximate Time, Long-Lat, City, Province, Location, Location Sensitivity & Type, Target type and Sect, Open/Close Space (as it will change the impact of blast waves due to reflection), min and max number of people killed and injured, number of suicide bombers, amount of explosive being used and the name of hospitals where victims went for treatment.\n\nSources: Unclassified media articles, hospital reports, think tank analysis and reports, and government official press releases.\n\n# Acknowledgements & References\n\nPakistan Body Count has been leveraged extensively in scholarly publications, reports, media articles and books.
